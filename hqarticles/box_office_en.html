            <p>Movies, as a perfect blend of art and commerce, have box office data that not only reflect economic performance but also result from the interplay of socio-cultural psychology, technological innovation, and globalization strategies.

            <h3>Socio-cultural Psychology and Box Office Data</h3>
            <h4>Collective Memory and Cultural Resonance</h4>
            <p><strong>1. Collective Memory and Cultural Resonance</strong><br>Movies evoke collective memories and cultural resonance by showcasing specific historical events, cultural symbols, or nostalgic elements. For example, the battle scenes in "The Battle at Lake Changjin" not only stirred national pride but also garnered widespread social attention, thereby boosting box office figures. This emotional resonance is not only a strategy to attract audiences but also a way to pass on culture. Filmmakers need to capture the pulse of society, designing narratives and visual elements that resonate emotionally with viewers, achieving a cultural echo.</p>

            <h4>Social Class and Consumer Behavior</h4>
            <p><strong>2. Social Class and Consumer Behavior</strong><br>Different social classes have varying preferences in movie consumption, which affects the distribution of box office earnings. High-income groups might prefer art films or international cinema, while middle and lower-income groups tend towards commercial blockbusters. This difference not only impacts individual movie earnings but also reflects the cultural consumption patterns of different social groups. By analyzing these behaviors, film production companies can devise more targeted marketing strategies to ensure that viewers of all levels find suitable movie experiences, thereby increasing overall box office revenue.</p>

            <h4>Psychological Marketing Strategies</h4>
            <p><strong>3. Psychological Marketing Strategies</strong><br>Movie marketing cleverly uses psychological strategies like emotional resonance, social proof, and the scarcity effect to attract audiences. For example, "Dying to Survive" showcased real-life struggles and emotional conflicts, successfully engaging audiences emotionally, leading to significant box office success. The application of psychology in movie marketing not only enhances the viewing experience but also provides a powerful boost to box office performance. Marketers need to deeply understand the psychological needs of their audience, designing marketing strategies that both resonate emotionally and encourage consumption.</p>
