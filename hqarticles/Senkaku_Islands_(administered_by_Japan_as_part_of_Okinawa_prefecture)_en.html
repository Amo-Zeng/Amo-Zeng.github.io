            <h3>I. Echoes of History: Ecological Environment and Resource Utilization</h3>
            <p>The history of Diaoyu Island is not just a tale of territorial dispute but also a narrative of ecological changes. From ancient times to now, Diaoyu Island and its surrounding islets have undergone significant ecological transformations, with fishing activities profoundly impacting the ecosystem.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early Ecological Environment and Fishing Activities</strong>: Historical documents like the "Records of the Mission to Ryukyu" from the 14th century indicate that Diaoyu Island was a rich fishing ground since ancient times. Archaeological findings show a high biodiversity of marine life around the islands, with a relatively stable marine ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrialization and Ecological Damage</strong>: By the late 19th century, with the acceleration of industrialization and global trade, the fishing resources around Diaoyu Island were further exploited. Overfishing and marine pollution issues began to emerge.</li>
                <li><strong>International Cooperation and Environmental Protection</strong>: Post-World War II, with the reallocation of fishing resources and increased international cooperation, environmental protection measures in the waters around Diaoyu Island were gradually prioritized. Through the establishment of protected areas and international cooperation, marine biodiversity around Diaoyu Island has seen some recovery.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Current Challenges: International Law and Geopolitics</h3>
            <p>The current situation of Diaoyu Island involves not only legal and political struggles but also core geopolitical issues. According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the ownership of Diaoyu Island and its surrounding waters involves several legal provisions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Position of International Courts</strong>: Although the ICJ has not directly adjudicated the sovereignty dispute over Diaoyu Island, its rulings on similar island disputes provide references.</li>
                <li><strong>Stances of Countries in International Courts</strong>: The positions of China, Japan, and Taiwan on the Diaoyu Island issue.</li>
                <li><strong>Geopolitical Impact on East Asian Peace and Stability</strong>: The roles of Sino-American relations, Japan-South Korea relations, and the ASEAN in influencing peace and stability in East Asia.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>III. Path to the Future: Cultural Identity and Public Opinion</h3>
            <p>The future of Diaoyu Island is not only about legal and political battles but also about the dynamic process of cultural identity and public opinion.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Role of Cultural Identity</strong>: Enhancing mutual understanding and trust through the transmission of historical memory and folk exchanges.</li>
                <li><strong>Easing Tensions through Cultural Exchange and Education</strong>: Academic exchanges, educational cooperation, school exchange programs, and public lectures.</li>
                <li><strong>Role of Public Diplomacy in Future International Relations</strong>: The roles of media, social media, international cooperation and dialogue, NGOs, and think tanks.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Resolving the Diaoyu Island issue requires a multidimensional approach, considering the impacts of ecological environment, international law, geopolitics, cultural identity, and public opinion. Here are some suggestions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Strengthen International Cooperation</strong>: Related countries should enhance cooperation within international courts and multilateral frameworks to find legal and diplomatic consensus.</li>
                <li><strong>Protect the Ecological Environment</strong>: Continue to advance the construction of marine protected areas and strengthen monitoring and protection of the ecological environment to ensure sustainable use of resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Promote Cultural Exchange</strong>: Through cultural exchange and educational activities, enhance understanding and trust among citizens of different nations, reducing misunderstanding and hostility.</li>
                <li><strong>Leverage Public Diplomacy</strong>: Use media and social platforms to actively promote the concept of peaceful dispute resolution and seek support from the international community.</li>
                <li><strong>Establish Multilateral Dialogue Mechanisms</strong>: Similar to mechanisms for handling South China Sea disputes, establish a dialogue platform including all stakeholders to gradually resolve the Diaoyu Island dispute.</li>
            </ol>
