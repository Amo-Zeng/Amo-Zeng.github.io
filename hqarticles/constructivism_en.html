            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As a disruptive theory of knowledge, constructivism challenges the traditional epistemology's absolute pursuit of "truth" and "objectivity," instead emphasizing that knowledge is constructed through social interaction and cultural practice. However, with the deepening of globalization, digitalization, and postmodern thought, the limitations of constructivism have gradually become apparent, particularly in the face of challenges related to cultural differences, technological power, and educational equity. Post-constructivism emerges in this context, not only inheriting the core ideas of constructivism but also further exploring the boundaries and tools of "construction," as well as critically reflecting on and critiquing the potential tendencies of relativism and nihilism. This article will dissect the transition from constructivism to post-constructivism through three dimensions: <strong>cultural differences and knowledge construction</strong>, <strong>cognitive reshaping in the digital age</strong>, and <strong>inclusive construction in the education field</strong>, and discuss how to achieve the reconstruction and development of knowledge systems based on critical analysis.</p>

            <h3>1. Cultural Differences and Knowledge Construction: The Collision and Fusion of Diverse Cultures</h3>
            <p>Constructivism emphasizes the social interaction of knowledge, but it falls short when faced with different cultural backgrounds. Post-constructivism further introduces cultural differences into the discussion of knowledge construction, emphasizing the significant differences in the discourse systems, symbol systems, and cognitive approaches relied upon by different cultural groups in the process of constructing knowledge.</p>
            <p>Take traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine as examples. These two medical systems, based on entirely different cultural backgrounds and philosophical thoughts, have constructed vastly different knowledge systems. Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes an "harmony between man and nature" holistic perspective, focusing on the balance of yin and yang and the harmony with the natural world; Western medicine, on the other hand, is based on empirical research in anatomy and biochemistry, striving for precise diagnosis and treatment of diseases. These different knowledge systems not only reflect different cultural traditions but also reveal the power dynamics in knowledge construction—the dominant position of Western medicine globally, to some extent, overshadows the voices of other medical systems, leading to a phenomenon of discourse hegemony.</p>
            <p>Post-constructivism calls for a profound reflection on these power dynamics and advocates for the inclusion of multicultural perspectives in knowledge construction to avoid the phenomenon of "knowledge colonialism" dominated by a single culture. By exploring the differences and similarities in knowledge construction across different cultural backgrounds, post-constructivism provides theoretical support for the diversity and inclusiveness of knowledge. In practice, this idea requires us to respect and integrate multicultural knowledge systems in a global context, offering more comprehensive and diverse solutions to challenges faced by humanity collectively.</p>

            <h3>2. Cognitive Reshaping in the Digital Age: Technological Power and the Boundaries of Knowledge Construction</h3>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technology is profoundly changing the way humans construct knowledge. New technologies such as social media, algorithm-based recommendations, and artificial intelligence are not only reshaping the paths of information dissemination but also deeply influencing people's cognitive structures and value systems. Post-constructivism, in this context, further expands the boundaries of "construction," emphasizing the complexity and dynamism of knowledge construction in the digital age.</p>
            <p>Firstly, the algorithm recommendation mechanisms of new media platforms shape users' information acquisition paths through personalized推送, thereby indirectly influencing their cognitive frameworks. This phenomenon of "filter bubbles" means that individuals, when constructing knowledge, often only come into contact with information that aligns with their existing viewpoints, forming a closed cognitive loop. Post-constructivism argues that this phenomenon conceals the implicit manipulation of individual cognition by technological power, a manipulation that is often difficult to detect.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies provides new tools for knowledge construction but also presents new challenges. Generative AI can create seemingly authentic texts, images, and videos, and how these "fictitious" pieces of knowledge are accepted and constructed by society becomes a focal point of post-constructivism. Post-constructivism emphasizes that in the digital age, the "truthfulness" and "credibility" of knowledge are no longer absolute but are gradually constructed through social interaction and the competition for discourse power.</p>
            <p>However, the rapid advancement of technology also raises discussions about the fairness of knowledge and the distribution of discourse power. Algorithm-based recommendations and personalized推送, to some extent, reinforce information inequality, making the acquisition of knowledge and information more dependent on the design of technological platforms. Ensuring the fair dissemination and sharing of knowledge while advancing technology becomes a crucial issue in the construction of knowledge in the digital age.</p>

            <h3>3. Inclusive Construction in the Education Field: From Individual Differences to Equal Participation</h3>
            <p>In the education field, constructivism provides significant support for learning theories, emphasizing that learning is an active process of construction, where students build knowledge through interaction with their environment. However, traditional constructivist perspectives often overlook the diversity of students' individual experiences and cultural backgrounds. Post-constructivism, on this basis, proposes a more inclusive and equitable educational philosophy.</p>
            <p>Firstly, post-constructivism emphasizes respecting students' individual differences and diversity in education. Students from different cultural backgrounds are influenced by their cultural traditions, value systems, and cognitive approaches when constructing knowledge. Educators should provide diversified teaching resources and interaction methods to promote knowledge sharing and understanding among students.</p>
            <p>Secondly, post-constructivism calls for breaking the discourse hegemony in education, particularly in language and symbol systems. In the globalized educational environment, English and other mainstream languages dominate, leading to a disadvantaged position for non-mainstream language groups in knowledge construction. Post-constructivism advocates for the use of diverse languages and symbol systems in education to ensure that every student can participate equally in the process of knowledge construction.</p>
            <p>Additionally, post-constructivism emphasizes the transparency of power relations in education. As representatives of authoritative knowledge, teachers often dominate the process of knowledge construction. Post-constructivism advocates for weakening these power relations through cooperative learning and the cultivation of critical thinking, allowing students to construct knowledge together in an equal environment.</p>
