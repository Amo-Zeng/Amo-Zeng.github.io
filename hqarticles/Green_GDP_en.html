            <h2>Green GDP: Reconstructing the Development Evaluation System</h2>
            <p>In the context of intensifying global climate change, ecosystem degradation, and tightening resource constraints, the traditional GDP accounting system is no longer suited to meet the demands of the new era. Green GDP, as a new indicator system for measuring the coordinated development of economy, society, and environment, is reshaping the value coordinates of global sustainable development. It is not only a profound reflection on traditional development models but also a strategic choice for building a new pattern of harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.</p>

            <h3>Defects in the Traditional GDP Accounting System</h3>
            <p>The traditional GDP accounting system has significant flaws: it only accounts for the positive outputs of economic activities while overlooking the negative costs of resource consumption and environmental damage. This "seeing trees but not the forest" accounting method has led many countries into the dilemma of "high growth, high pollution." According to the World Bank, the global economic loss caused by environmental pollution annually amounts to $4.6 trillion, equivalent to 6.2% of global GDP.</p>

            <h3>The Scientific Evaluation Framework of Green GDP</h3>
            <p>Green GDP incorporates natural resource consumption, environmental pollution losses, and ecological degradation costs into the accounting system, constructing a more scientific development evaluation framework. This shift is not only reflected in the numerical level but also represents a profound change in development philosophy. It requires countries to consider economic, ecological, and social benefits collectively during development, achieving a transition from "quantity-based growth" to "quality-based development."</p>

            <h3>The Coupling Relationship Between Green GDP and Social Well-being</h3>
            <p>There is a deep-level coupling relationship between Green GDP and social well-being. Research by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) shows a significant positive correlation between environmental quality and the Human Development Index (HDI). Good environmental conditions not only directly improve residents' quality of life but also indirectly promote social development through improved health and increased labor productivity.</p>

            <h3>Green GDP and the New Order of Global Governance</h3>
            <p>In the context of deepening globalization, Green GDP provides a new entry point for improving the global governance system. By establishing unified accounting standards and methodologies, it offers a common language and framework for international environmental governance cooperation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Establishing internationally recognized Green GDP accounting standards</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Improving environmental information disclosure and sharing mechanisms</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Promoting international cooperation in green finance</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing green technology transfer and capacity building</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Establishing a global carbon pricing mechanism</strong></li>

            <h3>Conclusion: Moving Towards a New Era of Green Civilization</h3>
            <p>Green GDP is not just an economic indicator but also a significant symbol of human civilization's progress. It marks the transition of human society from industrial civilization to ecological civilization and represents a shift in development philosophy from "conquering nature" to "harmonious coexistence."</p>
