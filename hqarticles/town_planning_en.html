You mentioned **"Mathematics A" (數甲)**, which likely refers to the **Mathematics A** curriculum in Taiwanese senior high schools. This is one of the mathematics subject categories in the college entrance exams (such as the General Scholastic Ability Test and the指定科目考試 - Subject Ability Test), designed for students aiming for science, engineering, or medical programs that require stronger math skills.

- Factoring and polynomial division
- Remainder and factor theorems
- Functions and their graphs
- Roots and inequalities of polynomial equations

#### 3. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
- Properties of exponents and logarithms
- Graphs of exponential and logarithmic functions
- Natural logarithm and Euler’s number (e)
- Applications of exponential/logarithmic functions (e.g. growth and decay)

#### 4. Sequences and Series
- Arithmetic sequences and series
- Geometric sequences and series
- Summation (Σ) and basic infinite series

#### 5. Permutation, Combination, and Probability
