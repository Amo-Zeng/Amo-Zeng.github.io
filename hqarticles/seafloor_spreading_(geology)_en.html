            <h2>The Pulse of Earth and the Memory of the Ocean: A Look at Earth's Self-Organization and Biodiversity through Seafloor Spreading</h2>
            <p>Earth, this blue planet, is not only the home of humanity but also a vibrant and complex system. Its "pulse" is not driven by a heart but by the geological process of seafloor spreading. Seafloor spreading is not only the core mechanism of plate tectonics theory but also a significant manifestation of Earth's self-organization, and a critical force shaping oceanic biodiversity.</p>

            <h3>I. Seafloor Spreading: The Release of Earth's Internal Energy and Self-Organization</h3>
            <p>Seafloor spreading is one of the primary ways Earth's internal energy is released. The internal energy of Earth primarily comes from the decay of radioactive elements, gravitational differentiation, and mantle convection. This energy breaks the crust and causes magma to rise, eventually forming new seafloor at mid-ocean ridges. This process, akin to the contraction and relaxation of a heart, periodically drives the cycle of material and energy flow on Earth's surface.</p>

            <h3>II. Ocean Circulation and Biodiversity: The Biological Implications of Plate Movement</h3>
            <p>Plate movement not only shapes the Earth's surface morphology but also profoundly affects global climate change and has a deep impact on oceanic biodiversity. Continental drift is a significant manifestation of plate movement, altering the distribution of landmasses on Earth's surface and subsequently affecting the distribution of wind belts and ocean currents.</p>

            <h3>III. "The Memory of the Ocean": A Time Machine for Interpreting Earth's History</h3>
            <p>In the vast ocean, the meandering mid-ocean ridges are like the backbone of Earth, being the most significant marker of seafloor spreading. Along these ridges, new oceanic crust continuously emerges from the mantle, like an endless production line, etching the internal memory of Earth into the solidified magma rocks.</p>

            <h3>IV. The Memory of the Ocean and Biodiversity: Geographical Isolation and Speciation</h3>
            <p>The separation and drifting of plates provide a unique geographical isolation mechanism for marine life. As two plates gradually move away from each other, the originally connected biological communities are isolated in different regions, forming isolated "evolutionary units." Over time, these isolated communities adapt to their respective environments, evolving different forms and functions, eventually giving rise to new species.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Pulse of Earth and the Memory of the Ocean</h3>
            <p>Seafloor spreading, as Earth's "heartbeat," is not only a manifestation of geological processes but also a vivid example of Earth's self-organization. Through periodic plate movement and crustal renewal, the internal and external environments of Earth maintain a dynamic balance.</p>
