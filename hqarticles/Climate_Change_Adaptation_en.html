            <h2>Introduction: A New Dimension of Climate Risk through AI</h2>
            <p>In the context of global climate change, artificial intelligence systems are transforming how we perceive, predict, and respond to climate risks. From global climate prediction platforms developed by IBM and Google, to Singapore's heatwave early warning system under the "Smart Nation" initiative, AI is rapidly becoming a core tool in climate risk management. At the same time, questions around "who holds the right to risk perception" become increasingly critical: technology is redefining the boundaries of who 'can see' and who 'can act', deepening patterns of power differentiation within global environmental governance.</p>

            <h3>Centralization of Risk Perception: How AI Changes the Power of 'Seeing the Danger'</h3>
            <p>Artificial intelligence has significantly enhanced the capability for climate data analysis and prediction. By combining high-resolution modeling, remote sensing, and historical data, AI systems can forecast the timing, location, and intensity of extreme weather events. However, these technologies are often concentrated in a small number of multinational tech companies or high-income countries. For instance, Google has partnered with several developing nations to deploy flood warning systems, yet the data sources, predictive models, and resulting outputs are largely controlled by the company.</p>
            <p>This technological centralization leads to a form of "monopolization" of risk information: government-led or locally grounded risk assessments based on lived experience are increasingly replaced by algorithm-driven predictions. In effect, the entities that control the AI models and training data gain the power to define which areas are considered risky.</p>

            <h3>Differentiation in Decision-Making Power: From Local Perception to Centralized Decisions</h3>
            <p>A deeper issue lies in: Who holds the authority to act based on perceived risks? For instance, an AI-generated flood risk map may algorithmically determine that a particular area should prioritize evacuation or the construction of levees. Yet, such decisions are often framed in technocratic and scientific terms, which can marginalize the political role of local governments or communities.</p>
            <p>This trend is already evident in multiple "smart city" projects around the world. In the Netherlands, AI-powered early warning systems are integrated with automated dam control systems, significantly improving response efficiency. Yet, this also removes decision-making authority from local political processes, placing it instead in the hands of technical experts and algorithmic models. This phenomenon of "technocratic governance" is quietly deepening across global climate adaptation strategies.</p>

            <h3>Implications for Global Climate Justice</h3>
            <p>These shifts raise foundational questions: How can the knowledge and decision-making power of the Global South and developing countries be better safeguarded in the design and implementation of AI-driven climate adaptation systems? These are not simply questions of technical performance, but profound challenges to the future of global climate justice.</p>
