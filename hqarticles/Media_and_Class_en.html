            <h2>Class Anxiety in Media Mirrors: Crossing from "Information Gap" to "Meaning Gap"</h2>
            <p>In the digital age, media is not only a tool for acquiring information but also a mirror of social reality, deeply influencing our cognition, behavior, and the reproduction of social classes. The class effects of media consumption, the reshaping of class mobility by the digital divide, and the propagation of class anxiety in media mirrors collectively constitute the complex landscape of social stratification and class solidification. This article will explore how media participates in class differentiation on multiple levels and propose paths to cross the "Information Gap" and "Meaning Gap".</p>

            <h3>1. Class Reproduction through Media Consumption: From "Information Gap" to "Meaning Gap"</h3>
            <p>Media consumption is not merely a process of information acquisition but also a mode of class reproduction. The traditional "Information Gap" focuses on the differences in information acquisition capabilities among different classes, which has evolved into a more complex "Meaning Gap" with the development of new media.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Differences in Media Literacy:</strong> Dual standards in information interpretation</li>
                <li><strong>Divergence in Value Orientation:</strong> Cultural identity and class interests alignment</li>
                <li><strong>Distribution of Discourse Power:</strong> Class dominance in the era of social media</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>2. Digital Divide: How Media Technology Innovation Reshapes Class Mobility</h3>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technology both provides new opportunities for class mobility and intensifies social differentiation through the digital divide.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Opportunities Provided by Digital Technology:</strong> Breaking barriers to class mobility</li>
                <li><strong>Challenges of the Digital Divide:</strong> Deepening class differentiation</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Balance of the Digital Divide:</strong> Dual effects of opportunities and challenges</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Class Anxiety in Media Mirrors: Construction through TV Dramas and We-Media</h3>
            <p>Media not only reflects class differences but also constructs and reinforces class anxiety through artistic creation and fragmented dissemination.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Class Struggle in TV Dramas:</strong> The interplay of reality and mirrors</li>
                <li><strong>Class Critique in We-Media:</strong> Fragmented dissemination of anxiety</li>
                <li><strong>Intergenerational Transmission:</strong> Continuation and expansion of class anxiety</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Paths to Cross the "Information Gap" and "Meaning Gap"</h3>
            <p>To achieve true social equality, it is necessary to cross the "Information Gap" and "Meaning Gap" from multiple levels:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Media Literacy</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Promoting Diverse Cultural Identities</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Balancing the Distribution of Discourse Power</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Bridging the Digital Divide</strong></li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Media in contemporary society is not only a messenger of information but also a constructor and propagator of class differentiation and social anxiety. From the "Information Gap" to the "Meaning Gap", the class effects of media consumption, the reshaping of class mobility by the digital divide, and class anxiety in media mirrors collectively reveal the complexity and dynamism of social classes in the digital era. Only through collaboration can we envision a more equal and harmonious social landscape in the mirrors of media, promoting inclusive social development.</p>
