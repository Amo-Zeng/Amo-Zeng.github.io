            <h2>Social Capital and Class Reproduction: The Invisible Divide in Modern Society</h2>
            <p>The concept of “social capital” has garnered significant attention and discussion in the fields of sociology, economics, and management in recent years. It plays a crucial role not only in individual career development but also in shaping the structure and dynamics of society. In essence, social capital refers to the resources accumulated by individuals through their social networks, including relationships, trust, information, and influence.

For example, alumni networks from prestigious universities are a typical case. These networks, composed of alumni, not only provide career development information and recommendations but also play a key role in recruitment and collaboration processes.</p>

            <h3>Indirect Impact of Social Capital on Class Reproduction</h3>
            <p>Social capital influences class reproduction not only through direct resource distribution and opportunity access but also through its powerful, albeit indirect, role in shaping cultural and social norms. The upper and upper-middle classes pass on specific values and behavioral norms to their descendants through institutions such as family, school, and community. This cultural transmission not only helps them adapt to and integrate into upper-class society but also shapes their identity and...</p>
