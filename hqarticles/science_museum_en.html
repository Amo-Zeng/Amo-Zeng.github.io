            <h4>New Forms of Popularization: Making Science Come Alive</h4>
            <p>From humorous short videos to interactive games, the ways of popularizing science are undergoing radical changes. Remember those viral "physics teachers proving Newton's first law with experiments" funny videos? Those originally boring physical laws became lively and interesting through exaggerated expressions and unexpected experiments. This form of learning through entertainment not only makes us laugh but also subtly engraves those once headache-inducing physics knowledge into our minds.</p>
            <p>"Science Video Challenge" and "Science Experiment Escape Room" are new forms of popularization that integrate scientific knowledge into games. In escape rooms, you need to use knowledge of chemical reactions, physical principles, and more to find clues to escape. Such interactive experiences are not only thrilling but also make learning about science more fun and proactive.</p>
