            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the field of materials science and engineering, the fatigue performance of materials is a critical indicator for evaluating their long-term reliability under dynamic loads. Fatigue refers to the phenomenon where materials fail after a certain number of cycles under alternating stress. Fatigue issues are particularly prominent in aerospace, automotive manufacturing, and bridge construction, directly affecting the safety and service life of structures. This article will comprehensively explore the application of microstructure, environmental factors, and smart materials with self-healing technology in fatigue control, aiming to provide a comprehensive theoretical basis for material design and engineering applications.</p>

            <h2>1. Correlation Between Microstructure and Fatigue Performance</h2>
            <p>Microstructure refers to the internal organization of materials, including grain size, grain boundary distribution, phase composition, dislocation density, etc. These microstructural features not only determine the basic physical and chemical properties of materials but also directly affect their mechanical properties during use, especially fatigue performance.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>1.1 Grain Size</h3>
                <p>Grain size is one of the important factors affecting the fatigue performance of materials. Studies have shown that fine-grained materials generally have better fatigue performance. Fine grains can increase the grain boundary area, and grain boundaries, acting as barriers to dislocation movement, can effectively prevent crack propagation. Additionally, fine-grained materials have a higher dislocation density, which helps absorb more energy, thereby enhancing the material's fatigue resistance.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>1.2 Grain Boundary Distribution</h3>
                <p>Grain boundaries are the interfaces between grains, and their presence can hinder crack propagation. The uniformity of grain boundary distribution significantly affects the fatigue performance of materials. Uniformly distributed grain boundaries can provide more crack propagation paths, thereby reducing the speed of crack propagation. Conversely, non-uniform grain boundary distribution can lead to localized stress concentration, accelerating crack formation and propagation.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>1.3 Phase Composition</h3>
                <p>The phase composition of materials is also an important factor affecting fatigue performance. In multiphase materials, the mechanical property differences between different phases can lead to stress concentration, thereby affecting fatigue performance. For example, the combination of hard and soft phases can increase the hardness and strength of materials, but it may also increase crack sensitivity. Therefore, optimizing phase composition to enhance material strength while reducing crack sensitivity is key to improving fatigue performance.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>1.4 Dislocation Density</h3>
                <p>Dislocations are linear defects within materials, and their movement and interaction significantly affect plastic deformation and fatigue performance. High dislocation density can provide more plastic deformation paths, helping to absorb energy and enhance the material's fatigue resistance. However, excessively high dislocation density can lead to stress concentration within the material, thereby reducing fatigue performance. Therefore, controlling the appropriate dislocation density is an important means of optimizing fatigue performance.</p>

            <h2>2. Impact of Environmental Factors on Fatigue Performance</h2>
            <p>The impact of environmental factors on the fatigue performance of materials cannot be ignored. Different environmental conditions can significantly alter the fatigue life and failure modes of materials. Environmental factors mainly include temperature, humidity, corrosive media, and stress state.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>2.1 Temperature</h3>
                <p>Changes in temperature can alter the mechanical properties of materials, such as elastic modulus and yield strength, thereby affecting the initiation and propagation rate of fatigue cracks. At high temperatures, the elastic modulus of materials decreases, and plastic deformation capability increases, which can accelerate the propagation rate of fatigue cracks.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>2.2 Humidity</h3>
                <p>The impact of humidity on material fatigue is mainly reflected in the oxidation and corrosion of material surfaces, especially in metallic materials. Humidity can accelerate the corrosion process, reducing the fatigue life of materials.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>2.3 Corrosive Media</h3>
                <p>The presence of corrosive media can accelerate chemical reactions on the material surface, forming corrosion products. These products may hinder crack propagation, but they can also become new crack sources, thereby affecting fatigue life. For example, metallic materials in environments containing chloride ions are prone to pitting corrosion, with pitting sites becoming the initiation points for fatigue cracks.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>2.4 Stress State</h3>
                <p>Different stress states (such as tensile stress, compressive stress, shear stress) have different impacts on material fatigue. Stress concentration areas are often high-risk zones for the initiation of fatigue cracks. For example, weld joints and bolt connections, due to geometric discontinuities, can easily form stress concentrations, thereby accelerating the formation of fatigue cracks.</p>

            <h2>3. Application of Smart Materials and Self-Healing Technology in Fatigue Control</h2>
            <p>Smart materials and self-healing technology provide new ideas and methods for solving material fatigue problems. Smart materials are those that can sense changes in the external environment and respond accordingly, while self-healing materials can automatically or through external stimuli restore their performance after damage.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>3.1 Fatigue Monitoring and Early Warning</h3>
                <p>Smart materials can monitor the stress state and damage level of materials in real time. For example, piezoelectric materials can convert mechanical stress into electrical signals, which can be transmitted in real time through a sensor network, thereby enabling the monitoring of the fatigue state of structures. When abnormalities are detected, the system can promptly issue a warning, alerting maintenance personnel to inspect and repair.</p>

                <h3>3.2 Automatic Repair of Damage</h3>
                <p>Self-healing materials can automatically repair microcracks when they appear, thereby delaying the further development of fatigue damage. For example, materials containing microcapsules can...</p>
