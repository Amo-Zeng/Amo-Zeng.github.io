            <h2>From Closed to Open: Deep Reconfiguration of Learning Spaces</h2>
            <p>Blended learning is driving education to shift from a "closed, institutionalized space" to an "open, socially embedded space." This process is not merely a technology-driven change, but a <strong>profound reconfiguration in the sociological sense of space</strong>. Drawing on Henri Lefebvre’s theory of "the production of space," learning spaces are no longer passive containers, but dynamic fields co-produced by social relations, power structures, and technological practices. Within the triad of "perceived—conceived—lived" space, blended learning, mediated by technology, dissolves the boundaries of schools and integrates them into communities, homes, and urban fabrics, giving rise to a <strong>nested, fluid learning ecology</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Heterotopias: The Extension of Education into Marginal Spaces</h3>
            <p>Michel Foucault’s concept of "heterotopia" provides a crucial analytical framework: community learning centers, digital libraries, and home learning corners are both physical places and sites of "otherness" that host virtual classrooms, remote collaboration, and intergenerational interaction. For example, Chengdu’s "Community Smart Learning Hubs" integrate government, corporate, and university resources to offer after-school tutoring and psychological support for migrant children. These hubs represent an <strong>institutional education extending into marginal spaces in a heterotopic manner</strong>, compensating for resource gaps while reconstructing pathways to social inclusion. Such spatial practices dismantle the "school-centered paradigm," positioning education as an integral part of urban governance.</p>

            <h3>Digital Public Learning Spaces in Smart Cities</h3>
            <p>In the context of smart cities, blended learning is further embedded into <strong>digital public spaces</strong>. Hangzhou’s "City Brain" project, in collaboration with the Education Bureau, has developed a "Learning Heatmap" that analyzes citizens’ online learning behaviors in real time to dynamically allocate community educational resources. Suzhou Museum’s AR-guided tours transform historical knowledge into immersive learning tasks, turning public cultural spaces into informal learning nodes. This confirms Lefebvre’s assertion that "space is a social product"—urban spaces are being re-encoded as "interfaces for learning," shifting the paradigm from "space ownership" to "space use."</p>

            <h3>The Home: From Observer to Collaborator as a Micro-Learning Field</h3>
            <p>The transformation of the home space is particularly profound. Beijing’s "Home-School Co-Education Platform" enables parents to participate in curriculum design via smart devices, transforming the family from an "observer of education" into a "learning collaborator." This redefines the home as a <strong>micro-learning field</strong> with expanded social functions. Yet, it also exposes structural inequalities: low-income families face "spatial exclusion" due to noise, overcrowding, or lack of digital literacy. Research shows that disparities in home learning environments can explain up to 32% of achievement gaps, highlighting the urgency of <strong>spatial justice</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Identity Fluidity: The Multi-Role Learner in Social Contexts</h3>
            <p>Social embedding also reshapes individual identities. In blended spaces, learners are no longer confined to a single "student" role, but become fluid identities—community collaborators, knowledge disseminators at home, digital citizens, and more. This "spatial identity fluidity" challenges the rigid identity frameworks of traditional education, shifting educational goals from "knowledge acquisition" to cultivating "social participation capabilities."</p>

            <h3>Future Challenges: Equity, Collaboration, and Agency</h3>
            <p>Future challenges lie in three dimensions: <strong>technological accessibility</strong> (bridging the digital divide), <strong>institutional coordination</strong> (establishing cross-sector spatial governance mechanisms), and <strong>individual agency</strong> (enhancing learners’ capacity for spatial choice). We must develop a "Learning Space Equity Index" to be integrated into urban development planning; promote a "City Learning Map" platform for visualizing and sharing resources; and design "spatial literacy" curricula to foster students’ critical awareness and strategic use of learning environments.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: A Spatial Revolution for Educational Democratization</h3>
            <p>Ultimately, the deeper significance of blended learning lies in: <strong>transforming education from a "prescribed curriculum" into a "practice nurtured by life"</strong>. When learning naturally occurs in community town halls, family dining tables, or during subway commutes, education achieves true social embedding—not merely spatial expansion, but a reallocation of educational power, resources, and responsibilities. This is not just a technological innovation, but a <strong>spatial revolution for educational democratization</strong>.</p>
