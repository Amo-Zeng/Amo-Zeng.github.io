            <h2>Integration and Innovation of Traditional Chinese Medicine: Building a New Paradigm for Global Health Governance</h2>
            <p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), as a treasure of the Chinese nation, has evolved over millennia, forming a unique theoretical system and abundant practical experience. However, against the backdrop of globalization and the rapid development of modern medicine, TCM not only faces challenges in传承 and development but also must navigate multiple tests of modernization and internationalization. At the same time, climate change, diverse health needs, and the diverse dialogue within the global medical system provide unprecedented opportunities for the revitalization and development of TCM. This article aims to explore how TCM can achieve intelligent diagnosis and treatment under the drive of digital technology, how it can engage in deep dialogue and integration with traditional medicine from various countries, and how, under the guidance of the concept of green development, it can contribute Eastern wisdom to global health governance, thus building a more comprehensive, inclusive, and sustainable new paradigm for global health governance.</p>

            <h3>I. Integration of TCM and Digital Health Technology: A Global Platform for Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technology provides powerful technical support for the modernization and internationalization of TCM. By deeply integrating TCM with cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, and cloud computing, we can not only promote the inheritance and innovation of TCM but also build a global intelligent diagnosis and treatment platform to meet global health needs.</p>
            <h4>1.1 The Necessity of TCM Inheritance and Digitalization</h4>
            <p>The theoretical system of TCM is profound, covering complex concepts such as Yin-Yang, Five Elements, and meridians, but its traditional master-apprentice inheritance model is inefficient and difficult to scale to meet the modern society's demand for TCM talents. The intervention of digital technology offers new possibilities for the inheritance of TCM. By constructing TCM knowledge graphs, the rich theories of TCM can be digitized, structured, and efficiently retrieved, providing convenient access to knowledge for TCM scholars and practitioners. For example, using natural language processing, AI can extract key information from vast amounts of ancient TCM texts, forming a systematic knowledge base to help scholars better understand the essence of TCM.</p>
            <h4>1.2 The Digital Path to TCM Modernization and Internationalization</h4>
            <p>TCM's personalized diagnosis and treatment models and holistic perspective have shown unique advantages in preventive healthcare and chronic disease management, but its diagnostic and treatment methods lack unified objective evaluation standards, making it difficult to gain broad recognition from the international community. The introduction of digital technology provides scientific tools for the modernization and internationalization of TCM. By standardizing and digitizing the TCM treatment process and establishing a TCM big data platform, evidence-based medical research can be conducted to provide scientific evidence for the clinical application of TCM. For example, using machine learning algorithms to analyze the relationship between TCM prescriptions and efficacy can provide more precise guidance for personalized TCM treatment, enhancing its competitiveness in the international medical system.</p>
            <h4>1.3 Construction of a Global TCM Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment Platform</h4>
            <p>The construction of a global TCM intelligent diagnosis and treatment platform requires the integration of TCM big data, AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment systems, personalized health management platforms, and international standards. The platform can not only provide global users with personalized health management services based on TCM theory but also promote the standardization and normalization of TCM by establishing international standards for TCM terminology, diagnostic and treatment protocols, and efficacy evaluation, enhancing TCM's recognition and competitiveness internationally. This platform will become an important carrier for TCM to go global, providing new solutions for global health governance.</p>

            <h3>II. Dialogue Between TCM Culture and Multinational Traditional Medicine: A Fusion System of Eastern and Western Medicine</h3>
            <p>In the globalized context, a single medical system is no longer sufficient to address the increasingly diverse health needs of humanity. The dialogue and integration of TCM culture with traditional medicine from other countries have become an important way to build a more comprehensive and inclusive health system.</p>
            <h4>2.1 Cross-Regional and Cultural Medical Dialogue</h4>
            <p>For a long time, Eastern and Western medicine have been seen as two distinct systems. Western medicine is based on reductionism, emphasizing precise diagnosis and treatment of diseases, while TCM is guided by holism, focusing on the balance of the human body and its internal and external environments. However, with the acceleration of globalization and the diversification of health needs, the dialogue between Eastern and Western medicine has become an inevitable trend. TCM culture, with its unique theoretical system and rich practical experience, has attracted worldwide attention; at the same time, traditional medicine from other countries, such as Ayurveda from India, traditional African medicine, and Native American medicine, has also made important contributions to human health from their unique perspectives and methods. This cross-cultural medical dialogue provides new insights for global health governance.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Medical Fusion Based on Common Values</h4>
            <p>The fusion of Eastern and Western medicine is not simply a combination of "Chinese herbs + Western drugs" but a system building based on common value pursuits. This fusion needs to take place at the conceptual, methodological, experiential, and cultural levels:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Conceptual Fusion</strong>: Drawing on the understanding of the human body, disease, and health from different medical systems to establish a more comprehensive medical model. For example, combining TCM's holistic perspective with Western medicine's evidence-based approach to form a diagnostic and treatment model that integrates "holism-localization."</li>
                <li><strong>Methodological Fusion</strong>: Integrating diagnostic and treatment methods from different medical systems to develop more effective treatment plans. For example, combining TCM external therapies such as acupuncture and massage with modern rehabilitation techniques to form a combined Chinese-Western rehabilitation system.</li>
                <li><strong>Experiential Fusion</strong>: Comparing and researching clinical experience accumulated from different medical systems to find the best combination of solutions. For example, conducting clinical studies on the combined use of Chinese and Western medications to explore their synergistic mechanisms.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Fusion</strong>: Strengthening exchanges between different medical cultures to enhance understanding and recognition, creating a favorable cultural atmosphere for medical fusion.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.3 Building a Community with a Shared Future for Human Health</h4>
            <p>Building a fusion system of Eastern and Western medicine is not only about the inheritance and development of traditional medicine but also a major contribution to the human health cause. This fusion will provide humanity with more comprehensive and personalized medical services while injecting new vitality into the development of world medicine. With the progress of technology and research, the fusion of Eastern and Western medicine will become more in-depth, forming a more complete medical system.</p>
