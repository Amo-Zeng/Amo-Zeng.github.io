            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Against the backdrop of global climate change, the role of the United Nations Climate Change conference (COP) as a core platform for international climate action has become increasingly prominent. COP not only facilitates policy dialogue between nations but also advances the process of global climate governance through multiple dimensions. This article explores the multidimensional role of COP in global climate governance from three angles: technological innovation, the involvement of non-state actors, and cooperation with the Global South, analyzing its effectiveness through specific cases, data analysis, authoritative research, and expert insights.</p>

            <h3>Technological Innovation: COP as a Technological Accelerator</h3>
            <p>Technological innovation plays a crucial role in addressing climate change. COP accelerates the dissemination and application of technological innovation through policy formulation, financial support, and international cooperation.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Policy and Target Setting:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>COP sets emission reduction targets and policy frameworks, providing market demand and policy support for technological innovation. For example, the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement encourage countries to take specific measures to promote green technology development.</li>
                        <li>According to data from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), since the signing of the Paris Agreement, global investments in renewable energy have exceeded $2.5 trillion, demonstrating the significant impact of policies on technological innovation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Funding and Technology Transfer:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>COP has established mechanisms like the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to help developing countries access the necessary technology and funding for sustainable development goals. By 2022, GCF had approved over $10 billion for climate projects, covering renewable energy, energy efficiency, adaptation measures, and more.</li>
                        <li>Research by the World Bank shows that the number of technology cooperation agreements reached during COP meetings has increased year by year, reaching a record high of over 500 in 2019, underscoring the pivotal role of COP in facilitating technology transfer.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>International Cooperation Platform:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>COP conferences provide a platform for governments, businesses, and NGOs to exchange and collaborate, promoting technology transfer and knowledge sharing.</li>
                        <li>Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), emphasized: "COP meetings play a critical role in promoting global energy transition and clean technology innovation, serving as a vital engine for global climate governance."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h3>Non-State Actors: Engines of Green Transition at COP</h3>
            <p>The role of non-state actors such as cities, companies, and NGOs in climate governance is increasingly significant. COP facilitates the green transition of these actors by establishing cooperative platforms, providing policy support and incentives, and offering funding and technological assistance.</p>
