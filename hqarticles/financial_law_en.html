            <h2>New Challenges and Opportunities in Fiscal Law: Digital Transformation and Global Governance</h2>
            <p>In the dual context of digital transformation and global governance, fiscal law faces new challenges and opportunities. By constructing an integrated framework that incorporates "algorithmic governance," "data security," "distributive justice," "social equity," and "international cooperation" alongside "competitive games," fiscal law can not only optimize decision-making, protect data, and promote fair distribution and social progress, but also deepen cooperation on a global level and address competitive games. This new paradigm will provide solid legal safeguards for achieving shared prosperity and global sustainable development, driving fiscal law to meet the needs of the new era and becoming a crucial force for social progress.</p>
