            <h2>Dynamic Evolution and Energy Conversion at the Nanoscale: From Catalysts to Self-Assembled Materials</h2>
            <p>In the rapid development of modern technology, the behavior of materials and energy conversion mechanisms at the nanoscale have gradually become a core area of scientific research. The dynamic surface chemistry of nanocatalysts, molecular self-assembly driven by quantum confinement effects, and the application of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in energy conversion reveal the complex energy flow and material evolution processes from the microscopic to the macroscopic level. These studies not only deepen our understanding of the fundamental physical and chemical laws at the nanoscale but also provide a solid theoretical foundation and practical guidance for designing efficient and intelligent materials and energy systems.</p>

            <h3>Dynamic Surface Chemistry of Nanocatalysts: The Transition from Static to Dynamic</h3>
            <p>Nanocatalysts play a crucial role in the chemical industry, but their surface structure is not static under reaction conditions; instead, it undergoes complex dynamic evolution. These changes include surface reconstruction, redox reactions, and crystal face variations, which directly affect the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. Understanding these dynamic changes is crucial for designing efficient and stable catalysts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Surface Reconstruction and Dynamic Adjustment of Active Sites</strong>: Under reaction conditions, surface atoms of nanocatalysts often rearrange, forming new active sites or altering the properties of existing active sites.</li>
                <li><strong>Redox Reactions and Catalyst Stability</strong>: Nanocatalysts often undergo multiple redox cycles during reactions, leading to dynamic changes in surface chemical states.</li>
                <li><strong>Crystal Face Changes and Regulation of Catalytic Performance</strong>: The crystal face structure of nanocatalysts significantly affects their catalytic performance. By regulating reaction conditions, the surface structure of the catalyst can be adjusted in real-time.</li>

            <h3>Applications of Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics in Energy Conversion: Energy Flow Pathways from Microscale to Macroscale</h3>
            <p>Energy conversion is a core driver of modern societal development, yet traditional energy conversion technologies are often constrained by the second law of thermodynamics, leading to low energy utilization efficiency. To overcome this bottleneck, non-equilibrium thermodynamics has become an important research direction.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microscale Energy Flow Pathways</strong>: At the microscale of energy conversion, energy flow pathways mainly include ion migration, electron transfer, and heat conduction.</li>
                <li><strong>Macroscale Energy Flow Pathways</strong>: At the macroscale, energy flow pathways involve more complex system-level phenomena, such as energy transfer networks and thermodynamic cycles.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Directions: From Fuel Cells to Biological Systems</strong>: Based on the theoretical framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we can explore multiple application directions to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of energy conversion.</li>
