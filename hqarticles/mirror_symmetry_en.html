            <h2>The Dance of Mirrors: From Time Symmetry to Cognitive Reconstruction</h2>
            <p>Mirrors, this ancient yet ever-new metaphor, have always occupied a unique place in the exploration and reflection of human civilization. They not only reflect the surface of reality but also reveal profound philosophical truths and cognitive mechanisms of time, self, and existence through their deep shadows. This article attempts to explore the unity and complexity of the mirrored world by integrating three dimensions: time symmetry in mirrors, cognitive symmetry in mirrors, and ontological reconstruction in the information age, thereby deepening our understanding of time, self, and existence.</p>

            <h3>I. Time Symmetry in Mirrors: The Dialogue Between Past, Present, and Future</h3>
            <p>Time, one of the most mysterious dimensions of the universe, is often considered as unidirectional and irreversible. However, when we examine time from a broader perspective, we find hidden symmetries—past and future are not截然对立的存在，but rather, they reflect and converse with each other. This symmetry is not only embodied in the conservation laws of physics but also profoundly influences human cognition and emotions.</p>
            <p>In the creative processes of art and science, the mirrored reflections of time symmetry are particularly significant. Artists achieve breakthroughs in future creations by revisiting past works, while scientists open up new fields in the unknown by reflecting on known domains. This dialogue between past and future is not limited to individual levels but runs through the development of human civilization. The ancient Greek philosophers' contemplation of eternity and change influenced the scientific revolution of the Renaissance, and the rapid development of modern technology is constantly rewriting our understanding of history. Time here presents a self-feedback mechanism, where past and future influence and shape each other through the present node.</p>
            <p>This mirrored symmetry in the time dimension is also reflected in the meaning construction of individual lives. Every current choice is a reflection of past experiences and a projection of future possibilities. The Zen saying "three times in one" eloquently describes this holistic perspective on the time dimension—past, present, and future are not fragmented existences but form a complete dance of time.</p>

            <h3>II. Cognitive Symmetry in Mirrors: The Mutual Construction of Self and Other</h3>
            <p>If time symmetry in mirrors reveals the relationship between past and future, then cognitive symmetry in mirrors demonstrates the mutual construction of self and other. In the corridor of philosophy, the relationship between self and other has always been a core issue. From Descartes' "I think, therefore I am" to Levinas's "ethics of the Other," the exploration of this issue has never ceased. In the context of cognitive science, the discovery of the mirror neuron system provides a new perspective on understanding this relationship.</p>
            <p>Mirror neurons enable us to understand others' intentions and emotions through a "mental simulation" mechanism, thereby forming empathy. This mechanism indicates that self-cognition and understanding of others are not separate but mutually constructed through mirrored reflections. This cognitive symmetry not only affects our social interactions and emotional expressions at the individual level but also shapes our deeper understanding of self and the world.</p>
