            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Gravity, as one of the most fundamental forces in the universe, not only shapes the orbits of galaxies, stars, and planets but also plays a crucial role in the microscopic world and the field of biology. This article will explore quantum gravity theory, the application of universal gravitation in biology, and the interpretation of gravitational waves in culture and art, attempting to reveal the profound influence of gravity from multiple perspectives.</p>

            <h3>I. Exploration of Quantum Gravity Theory</h3>
            <p>Quantum gravity theory attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity, which show contradictions and inconsistencies under certain extreme conditions like inside black holes or during the Big Bang.</p>
            <h4>Limitations of General Relativity:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>General relativity excellently describes how gravity curves spacetime, but fails to handle quantum effects at microscopic scales.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Limitations of Quantum Mechanics:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Quantum mechanics successfully describes the behavior of particles in the microscopic world but fails under strong gravitational fields.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Current Research Progress:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>String Theory:</strong> Assumes that all fundamental particles are different vibrational modes of tiny "strings," attempting to unify all fundamental forces.</li>
                <li><strong>Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG):</strong> By quantizing spacetime itself, it provides a discrete structure of spacetime.</li>
                <li><strong>Asymptotic Safety:</strong> Proposes that at very high energies, the gravitational coupling constant might reach a fixed point.</li>
                <li><strong>Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT):</strong> Explores the quantum properties of spacetime through computer simulations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Main Challenges:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Difficulty in experimental verification</li>
                <li>Mathematical complexity</li>
                <li>Challenges in theoretical unification</li>
                <li>Consistency with other physical theories</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Future Directions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Breakthroughs in experiments and observations</li>
                <li>Deepening of simulations and computations</li>
                <li>Interdisciplinary research</li>
                <li>Deepening research on fundamental physical phenomena</li>
                <li>Innovations in philosophy and methodology</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Gravity is not just a concept in physics; it influences everything from the quantum world to biological systems, and to human culture and art. Through the exploration of quantum gravity theory, our understanding of the universe deepens; in biology, the study of universal gravitation reveals interactions between life and environment; the discovery of gravitational waves inspires new perspectives in art. By integrating these three areas of study and interpretation, we not only expand the boundaries of science but also enrich humanity's understanding of itself and the universe.</p>
            <p>Through this article, we showcase the interdisciplinary nature of science, illustrating how science intertwines with art and culture to create a more profound and innovative body of knowledge. Gravity serves as a nexus, closely linking human intellect, creativity, and curiosity about the unknown, driving us to continuously explore the mysteries of the cosmos.</p>
