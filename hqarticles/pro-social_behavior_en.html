            <h2>A Comprehensive Perspective on Prosocial Behavior: Evolution, Neuroscience, and Social Construction</h2>
            <p>Prosocial behavior, often viewed as purely altruistic, is actually a complex interplay of mechanisms and motivations. Through the lenses of evolutionary game theory, neuroscience, and social constructivism, we can gain a deeper understanding of the multifaceted dynamics and impacts of such behavior.</p>

            <h3>Evolutionary Game Theory Perspective: The Evolutionarily Stable Strategy of Prosocial Behavior</h3>
            <p>Evolutionary game theory reveals how reciprocal altruism naturally evolves and sustains in systems without central authority. The core mechanism lies in individuals helping others to secure future rewards, achieving a balance between individual and group interests. Reciprocal forms vary, including direct, indirect, and network reciprocity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Direct Reciprocity:</strong> Individuals receive immediate rewards for direct acts of help, such as food sharing in hunter-gatherer societies.</li>
                <li><strong>Indirect Reciprocity:</strong> Enhancing social reputation to secure more future help opportunities, such as charitable donations.</li>
                <li><strong>Network Reciprocity:</strong> Utilizing network platforms for resource sharing and mutual assistance, such as the rise of crowdfunding platforms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The spread and evolution of prosocial genes are crucial. Natural selection favors individuals with prosocial behaviors, as they are more likely to receive group support and resources, thereby improving survival and reproductive chances. Cultural transmission promotes the learning and inheritance of prosocial behaviors through education, media, and social norms.</p>

            <h3>Neuroscience Perspective: The "Pleasure" Mechanism of Prosocial Behavior</h3>
            <p>Neuroscientific studies show that prosocial behaviors stimulate the brain to produce "pleasure," resulting from internal neurobiological mechanisms. The release of neurotransmitters like oxytocin and dopamine, along with the activation of specific brain areas, fulfill social cooperation needs and provide intrinsic satisfaction.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC):</strong> Evaluates the emotional value and social significance of behaviors.</li>
                <li><strong>Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA):</strong> Dopamine release provides a sense of pleasure.</li>
                <li><strong>Medial Forebrain Bundle (MFB):</strong> Oxytocin enhances social bonding.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Social Constructivism Perspective: The Cultural Script of Prosocial Behavior</h3>
            <p>Social constructivism unveils the cultural contexts and influences of education, media, and other factors on prosocial behavior. Cultural backgrounds such as collectivism and individualism shape the forms of prosocial behavior. Education cultivates prosocial behaviors through moral education and a sense of social responsibility.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cultural Background:</strong> Collectivism and individualism shape the forms of prosocial behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> Cultivates prosocial behaviors through moral education and a sense of social responsibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Media:</strong> Positively portrays prosocial behaviors to help audiences learn behavioral patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Religion:</strong> Encourages prosocial behaviors through moral norms and doctrines.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In modern society, prosocial behaviors face challenges such as moral coercion and fake charity, requiring reflection and reform to build a healthier and more authentic culture.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Prosocial behavior is an enactment of the "cultural script" from a social constructivist perspective, a behavioral pattern learned during the socialization process. Cultural backgrounds, education, media, religion, and other factors jointly weave this "script," enabling its rich diversity across various social scenarios. However, in modern society, prosocial behaviors also face the risk of alienation. We need to reflect on and reform our approach to building a healthier, more authentic culture of prosocial behavior to promote social harmony and progress.</p>
