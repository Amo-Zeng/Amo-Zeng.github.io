            <h2>The Path to Sustainable E-commerce in the Digital Economy Era</h2>
            <p>In the digital economy era, the rapid rise of e-commerce has not only reshaped global trade patterns but also profoundly transformed production methods, consumption modes, and resource allocation, becoming a new engine driving global economic growth. However, this development is also accompanied by new social and environmental issues. How to achieve sustainable development of e-commerce in this context has become a core issue of global digital governance. This article will explore the paths to building a sustainable digital economy ecosystem from three dimensions: the balance between cross-border e-commerce and data privacy protection, the legal boundaries of e-commerce platform responsibility and AI technology, and the "green consumption" in e-commerce and its legal guidance. It aims to provide theoretical support and practical guidance for the future development of global e-commerce.</p>

            <h3>I. Cross-border E-commerce and Data Privacy Protection: New Challenges in Global Digital Governance</h3>
            <p>With the deepening of globalization, cross-border e-commerce has become an important link connecting global markets, and data cross-border flow is the core element supporting this model. However, the conflict between data privacy protection and international trade facilitation has become increasingly prominent, posing a key challenge in global digital governance.</p>
            <h4>1. The Game of Data Sovereignty and Trade Facilitation: A Contest of International Power and Interests</h4>
            <p>The concept of data sovereignty originates from the competition for data resources among countries, especially in the context of intensified global digital economy competition, where data has become a national strategic resource. The EU has established a strict data sovereignty framework through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), giving it strong regulatory power in global data flows. However, the U.S. "Cloud Act" has legally strengthened its data access rights globally, triggering strong opposition from other countries and intensifying the game of global data sovereignty. This博弈not only reflects the competition for data control rights among countries but also reflects the profound changes in the international political and economic order in the digital age.</p>
            <h4>2. Balancing International Cooperation and Local Regulation: Seeking a Path to Global Consensus</h4>
            <p>Facing the opposition between data sovereignty and trade facilitation, the international community is actively exploring solutions. On the one hand, the signing of bilateral or multilateral agreements provides a legal basis for data cross-border flows, such as the USMCA and CPTPP, both of which include provisions on data cross-border flows. On the other hand, regional organizations or countries are trying to establish a "data cross-border transmission assessment mechanism," formulating differentiated cross-border transmission rules based on data types, usage scenarios, and sensitivity. However, the implementation of this balancing mechanism still faces many challenges, especially in the context of enhanced data sovereignty awareness, how to ensure the effectiveness of international cooperation needs further exploration.</p>
            <h4>3. Future Prospects for Cross-border E-commerce and Data Privacy Protection: Building a New Order in Global Digital Governance</h4>
            <p>To build a new order in global digital governance, a more transparent and unified data privacy protection framework needs to be established at the global level. Countries should reach consensus on issues such as data cross-border flow, privacy protection, and network security through international dialogue and cooperation, while encouraging multinational enterprises to actively fulfill their social responsibilities and promote data sharing and cross-border cooperation. In addition, technological innovation is also a key to solving this problem, such as the application of blockchain technology in data credible transmission, which is expected to provide a safer and more efficient solution for data cross-border flow.</p>

            <h3>II. E-commerce Platform Responsibility and Legal Boundaries of AI Technology: Compliance Challenges in Digital Transformation</h3>
            <p>With the wide application of AI technology, the legal boundaries of e-commerce platforms' responsibilities have become increasingly blurred. How to clearly define the platform's responsibilities in areas such as false advertising, product safety, and consumer rights protection has become a core legal issue in the digital economy era.</p>
            <h4>1. Legal Responsibilities of False Advertising and Product Safety: The Dual Roles of Platforms</h4>
            <p>According to the E-commerce Law, platforms bear indirect responsibilities in issues of false advertising and product safety: on the one hand, as information intermediaries, platforms need to reasonably review the advertising content of merchants; on the other hand, platforms need to establish strict quality control mechanisms for high-risk products (such as medical devices, food, etc.). For example, if a platform is aware or should be aware of false advertising without taking necessary measures, it may bear joint liability with the merchant; failure to effectively monitor quality issues of high-risk products may result in administrative penalties or civil compensation for the platform.</p>
            <h4>2. Compliance Requirements and Potential Risks of AI Technology: From Efficiency Tools to Legal Responsibility Subjects</h4>
            <p>The application of AI technology in areas such as recommendation algorithms, intelligent customer service, and content review has improved platform efficiency while also bringing new legal risks. The transparency and fairness issues of recommendation algorithms may harm consumers' rights; erroneous decisions of intelligent customer service may lead to legal disputes; and algorithmic misjudgments in content review may affect freedom of speech. These issues not only require higher technical capabilities from the platform but also pose challenges to the inclusiveness and flexibility of the law.</p>
            <h4>3. The Application of the Technology Neutrality Principle and Legal Responsibility Reconstruction: Legal Innovation in the AI Era</h4>
            <p>The traditional scope of application of the technology neutrality principle is being challenged, especially in the context of the deep penetration of AI technology. In the future, the law needs to clearly define the obligations and responsibility boundaries of platforms in AI technology applications, especially in areas such as algorithmic decision-making, data processing, and content review. At the same time, platforms need to establish a sound AI technology compliance mechanism, ensuring the legality and sustainability of their operations through dual guarantees of technology and legal norms.</p>

            <h3>III. "Green Consumption" in E-commerce and Legal Guidance: The Path to Sustainable Development</h3>
            <p>While promoting economic growth, e-commerce has also been criticized for issues such as packaging waste and carbon emissions. In this context, "green consumption" has become a key path to achieving the sustainable development of e-commerce, and legal guidance provides institutional guarantees and direction for this path.</p>
            <h4>1. The Status and Challenges of Green Consumption in E-commerce: From Resource Waste to Environmental Burden</h4>
            <p>Excessive packaging and resource waste, high energy consumption and carbon emissions in logistics, and uneven consumer environmental awareness have become major obstacles to the sustainable development of the e-commerce industry. For example, the excessive use of e-commerce packaging leads to the generation of a large amount of plastic waste, while the inefficiency of the logistics system exacerbates the issue of carbon emissions.</p>
            <h4>2. The Role of Legal Guidance in Promoting Green Consumption in E-commerce: Combining Mandatory and Incentive Measures</h4>
            <p>Law can promote the transformation of the e-commerce industry towards green consumption through mandatory norms and incentive measures. For example, the formulation of mandatory standards for environmentally friendly packaging, tax incentives for green logistics, or the legal protection of consumers' environmental rights can guide enterprises to implement green strategies and promote the entire industry towards sustainable development.</p>
            <h4>3. The Path to Building a Legal System for Green Consumption in E-commerce: From National to International Collaboration</h4>
            <p>To better guide the e-commerce industry to implement green consumption strategies, it is necessary to formulate a special e-commerce green consumption law, improve traceability and certification systems, and strengthen international cooperation and standardization. For example, by establishing unified green consumption standards, promoting the greening of cross-border e-commerce, and solving policy and technical challenges in green consumption through international cooperation.</p>

            <h3>IV. Conclusion: The Path to Sustainable Development of the Digital Economy</h3>
            <p>In the digital economy era, the sustainable development of e-commerce is not only related to economic growth but also to the future of the global environment. By balancing cross-border e-commerce and data privacy protection, clarifying the legal boundaries of e-commerce platform responsibilities and AI technology, and promoting green consumption in e-commerce through legal guidance, we can build a more equitable, transparent, and sustainable digital economy ecosystem.</p>
            <p>In the future, countries need to strengthen cooperation in digital governance, improve legal systems, and promote technological innovation to address the new challenges brought by the digital economy. Only in this way can we achieve inclusive development of the digital economy, allowing global consumers to share the benefits of the digital era while contributing to the sustainable development of the planet.</p>
