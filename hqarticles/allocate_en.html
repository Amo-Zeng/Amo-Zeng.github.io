            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The issue of distribution has been a constant throughout human history, from early land distribution to modern resource allocation, it has always been a core issue in social development. However, with the rapid advancement of technology, especially the rise of artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain, and other technologies, the logic of distribution is undergoing profound changes. This article will explore how to construct a more fair, efficient, and sustainable distribution system in the context of technological progress.</p>

            <h2>I. The Distribution Challenges in the Algorithmic Era: From Efficiency to Fairness</h2>
            <p>With the widespread application of artificial intelligence and big data technologies, algorithms are playing an increasingly important role in resource allocation. However, the enhancement of efficiency does not necessarily lead to fairness, and the distribution mechanisms in the algorithmic era are facing unprecedented fairness challenges.</p>
            <h3>1.1 Implicit Inequities in Algorithmic Allocation</h3>
            <p>The core goal of algorithms is to optimize efficiency, but this optimization often relies on historical data and statistical models, which may inherently contain social inequalities. For example, ride-sharing platform dispatch algorithms might prioritize drivers with high historical order completion rates, while neglecting those whose order frequencies are limited by location or personal habits.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Data Bias and Social Stratification</h3>
            <p>The essence of algorithmic discrimination is the manifestation of data bias. The data relied upon by algorithms often reflects existing social inequalities, such as sparse data in certain regions, which may lead to unfair services in those areas.</p>
            <h3>1.3 Building Transparent and Fair Algorithmic Allocation Systems</h3>
            <p>In the face of fairness challenges in the algorithmic era, we need to approach the construction of a fairer distribution system from three aspects: transparency, data diversity, and ethical review.</p>

            <h2>II. The Distribution Game in Intimate Relationships: Balancing Emotional Resources</h2>
            <p>In addition to material resources, the distribution of emotional resources is also an important issue in social relationships. In intimate relationships, the allocation of emotional resources (such as time, energy, attention, etc.) directly affects the stability and happiness of the relationship.</p>
            <h3>2.1 The Imbalance Crisis in Emotional Resource Allocation</h3>
            <p>In intimate relationships, the allocation of emotional resources often involves a gamble between "one-sided giving" and "excessive taking." Excessive giving by one party may lead to a decrease in self-value, while excessive taking by the other may lead to exhaustion and the breakdown of the relationship.</p>
            <h3>2.2 Building a Healthy Emotional Resource Allocation Mechanism</h3>
            <p>To balance the allocation of emotional resources, both parties need to establish a clear "emotional contract," engaging in open communication about their needs and expectations.</p>

            <h2>III. New Models of Resource Sharing in Future Society: From Scarcity to Abundance</h2>
            <p>With technological advancements, the traditional assumption of scarcity is being broken. The production and dissemination costs of information, knowledge, and data have significantly decreased, and their modes of replication and distribution are changing.</p>
