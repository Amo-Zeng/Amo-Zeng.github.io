            <h2>Comprehensive Treatment of Tumor Angiogenesis: Biomarkers, Nanomedicine, and Personalized Strategies</h2>
            <p>Tumor angiogenesis is a critical biological process for tumor growth and metastasis, and a deeper understanding of its mechanisms offers various new avenues for treatment and diagnosis. This article will comprehensively discuss biomarker research, nanomedicine interventions, and personalized treatment strategies for tumor angiogenesis, aiming to provide a more holistic and in-depth perspective for tumor treatment.</p>

            <h3>Discovery and Application of Biomarkers</h3>
            <p>Biomarker research for tumor angiogenesis is a new frontier for tumor diagnosis and prognosis. By identifying specific markers of key molecules such as VEGF and PDGF, we can predict the activity of tumor angiogenesis early. These markers not only aid in early diagnosis but also provide scientific evidence for treatment selection and prognosis evaluation. For example, an increase in VEGF levels in plasma often indicates enhanced tumor angiogenesis, while PDGF-related markers reflect the activity state of vascular support cells in the tumor microenvironment.</p>
            <p>To apply these biomarkers clinically, researchers are developing non-invasive or minimally invasive detection methods, such as highly sensitive immunoassay techniques and liquid biopsy technologies. These applications not only track molecular changes in tumors but also monitor treatment responses and disease progression in real-time, providing a basis for the formulation of personalized treatment plans.</p>

            <h3>Innovation and Challenges in Nanomedicine</h3>
            <p>Nanomedicine provides revolutionary solutions for the intervention of tumor angiogenesis. Novel nanodrug delivery systems can specifically target tumor vasculature, delivering drugs precisely to the tumor site and reducing side effects on normal tissues. For instance, nanoparticles can be guided to tumor vasculature by specific receptors on tumor endothelial cells, achieving efficient drug delivery. Additionally, the size and surface properties of nanoparticles can be finely tuned to enhance their penetration and retention effects (EPR effect) in tumors, further improving therapeutic efficacy.</p>
            <p>Nanotechnology also shows great potential in inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. By encapsulating drugs that inhibit VEGF signaling pathways, nanoparticles can directly target tumor endothelial cells, blocking their proliferation and migration processes. Combined with photothermal and photodynamic therapies, nanomaterials can generate heat or reactive oxygen species (ROS) under specific wavelength light irradiation, effectively destroying tumor vasculature and cells, and minimizing damage to surrounding normal tissues.</p>

            <h3>Development of Personalized Treatment Strategies</h3>
            <p>The heterogeneity of tumor angiogenesis requires us to develop more precise personalized treatment strategies. By analyzing vascular features in the tumor microenvironment, such as vascular density, morphology, and functional status, we can provide a basis for personalized treatment strategies for different tumor types and stages.</p>
