            <h3>1. Basic Concepts and Core Principles of the Circular Economy</h3>
            <p>The circular economy is an economic development model that focuses on the efficient use and recycling of resources, aiming to reduce resource consumption and lower environmental pollution. Its core principles include "Reduce," "Reuse," and "Recycle," known as the 3R principles. In the food processing industry, the practice of the circular economy not only helps improve resource utilization efficiency but also effectively reduces waste generation and minimizes environmental impact.</p>

                <li><strong>Raw Material Procurement and Supply Chain Management</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sustainable Procurement:</strong> Selecting sustainably grown and raised raw materials, such as organic agricultural products and sustainable fisheries products, to reduce negative environmental impacts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Supply Chain Transparency:</strong> Establishing a transparent supply chain management system to ensure the traceability of raw material sources and enhance the sustainability of the supply chain.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Resource Efficiency in Production Processes</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Energy Management:</strong> Using energy-efficient equipment, optimizing production processes, and reducing energy consumption. For example, utilizing waste heat recovery systems to use the residual heat generated in production for other production stages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Water Resource Management:</strong> Reducing water consumption and pollution through recycling water systems and wastewater treatment technologies. For example, using membrane separation technology to treat wastewater and achieve water resource recycling.</li>
                        <li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> Classifying and processing waste generated during production, converting it into valuable resources through biodegradation, composting, and other technologies. For example, converting food processing waste into organic fertilizers or bioenergy.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Product Design and Packaging</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Green Packaging:</strong> Using biodegradable or recyclable packaging materials to reduce the generation of packaging waste. For example, using biodegradable plastics or paper packaging.</li>
                        <li><strong>Product Design:</strong> Designing products that are easy to recycle and reuse, extending the product's lifespan. For example, developing reusable food containers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Market and Consumer Education</strong>
