            <h3>The Future of Education: Cultivating Practical and Innovative Abilities</h3>
            <p>The traditional model of knowledge传授 is gradually being replaced by new modes that emphasize the cultivation of practical and innovative abilities. In this transformation, education ceases to be merely the transmission of knowledge but becomes a process that stimulates students' inherent potential and creativity.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Constructing a New Educational System</h3>
            <p>Looking ahead, we need to build an educational system that can effectively acquire knowledge and cultivate innovative abilities. This system should encourage students not only to learn knowledge but also to learn how to learn, how to think, and how to apply what they have learned to solve practical problems. Only in this way can we, in the ocean of knowledge, be not just voyagers but creators.</p>
