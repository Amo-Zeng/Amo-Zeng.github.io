            <h2>Emotion Heatmap and Anti-Script Testing: Tools for Decoding User Subconscious</h2>
            <p>In the field of user experience design, understanding users' true feelings and needs is crucial. However, traditional user research methods often struggle to capture the real experiences at the subconscious level. Emotion Heatmap and Anti-Script Testing, as two emerging research methods, provide us with deeper insights into user psychology.</p>

            <h3>Emotion Heatmap: The "Thermometer" for Capturing Subconscious</h3>
            <p>Emotion Heatmap visualizes users' emotional changes, helping us understand their experiences more objectively, in real-time, and comprehensively. Its advantages include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective and Real:</strong> Based on physiological responses, unaffected by subjective consciousness.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Dynamics:</strong> Records emotional changes in real-time, capturing subtle fluctuations.</li>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Coverage:</strong> Covers the entire experience process, understanding emotional changes at different stages.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through Emotion Heatmap, we can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identify Emotional Peaks:</strong> Discover users' most satisfying and enjoyable experiences, optimizing product highlights.</li>
                <li><strong>Detect Emotional Lows:</strong> Identify users' most dissatisfying and painful experiences, addressing product pain points.</li>
                <li><strong>Analyze Emotional Trends:</strong> Understand the patterns of users' emotional changes, optimizing product processes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Anti-Script Testing: User Truth Archaeology in Destructive Experiments</h3>
            <p>Anti-Script Testing systematically creates experience breakdown points to uncover users' true needs in stress responses. Its core lies in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Breakdown as Data:</strong> Through destructive experiments, discover unexpected user behavior patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>The Gift of Anger:</strong> Reveal unmet needs in user stress situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Destructive Art on Ethical Tightrope:</strong> Build controlled "safe breakdown zones" to elicit genuine reactions without causing irreversible harm.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Applications of Anti-Script Testing include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microsoft Research:</strong> By delaying software responses, discovered user alternative operation schemes, optimizing multitasking systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Mazda:</strong> By designing hard-to-turn-off alarm systems, exposed vehicle system maintainability defects, developing modular electrical architecture.</li>
                <li><strong>New York Public Library:</strong> By complicating digital borrowing systems, discovered the need for digital services in physical spaces, enhancing the utilization of physical resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Riot Games:</strong> By periodically shutting down server functions, observed innovative player game modes, developing popular game modes.</li>
                <li><strong>Nest:</strong> By intentionally misadjusting temperatures, discovered user trust mechanisms in automation algorithms, redesigning product features.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Emotion Heatmap and Anti-Script Testing, as two complementary research methods, provide us with tools to deeply understand user subconscious. By capturing users' emotional changes and stress responses, we can more accurately identify user needs, optimize product design, and enhance user experience. In the era of experience economy, these methods will become key drivers of product evolution, helping us stand out in a competitive market.</p>
