            <h2>Multidimensional Expression in Architectural Painting: Traces of Time, Transparent Architecture, and Emotional Sentiment</h2>
            <p>Architectural painting, as a unique form of art, is not merely a reproduction of architectural exteriors but also a profound exploration of time, space, and emotion by the artist. Through different creative perspectives and techniques, architectural painting can present multi-layered visual and emotional experiences. This article will delve into the multidimensional expression of architectural painting from three angles: "Traces of Time," "Transparent Architecture," and "Emotional Architecture," enhancing the rigor and creativity of the piece with precise artistic terminology and theoretical concepts.</p>

            <h3>Traces of Time: History and Change in Architectural Painting</h3>
            <p>Architectural painting can first depict the building at the moment of its construction, full of vigor and vitality like a newborn. The painter can use delicate brushwork and bright colors to capture this freshness. However, as time passes, buildings undergo erosion from the elements and the passage of history, which are meticulously recorded by artists in their paintings. Cracks in walls, weathering of stone, and fading of colors are all irreversible marks left by time.</p>
            <p>From these historical paintings, we not only see the appearance of the architecture but also feel the flow of time and the weight of history, providing viewers with an experience of transcending time and space. By employing techniques like "color separation" and "chiaroscuro," artists can more accurately depict the state of buildings at different times, allowing viewers to hear the footsteps of time and feel the depth of history when appreciating the artwork.</p>

            <h3>Transparent Architecture: Surreal Visual Experiences in Painting</h3>
            <p>Under the concept of "Transparent Architecture," artists attempt to break the limitations of physical space through perspective and imagination, making the building appear transparent, overlapping, or deformed in visual effect. This painting technique not only challenges traditional visual representations of architecture but also offers a surreal visual experience. Paintings of transparent architecture allow viewers to observe the internal structure of the building from various angles, or even scenes inside the building, as if the building itself were a transparent shell.</p>

            <h3>Emotional Architecture: Emotional Expression in Painting</h3>
            <p>Architectural painting is not just static documentation; it's also a dynamic expression of emotion. Artists convey the emotional state of the architecture or the people within it through changes in color, line, and light. Architecture can be depicted as a warm home, a cold fortress, or a space filled with hope for the future.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Combining the above three sections, architectural painting is not just a depiction of architectural forms but also a multidimensional expression of the passage of time, the transformation of space, and human emotion. By recording the traces of time, painting allows us to experience the weight of history; the concept of transparent architecture lets us transcend physical space, entering a surreal visual experience; and emotional architectural painting lets us feel the emotional pulse behind the architecture. Thus, architectural painting is not only art but also an emotional journey through time and space, providing us with a new perspective to re-evaluate and understand the relationship between architecture and humans. By using precise artistic terminology and theoretical concepts, this article aims to enhance the rigor and creativity, offering a deeper artistic experience to the viewers.</p>
