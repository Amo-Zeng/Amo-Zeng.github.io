            <h3>Temporal-Spatial Segmentation Technology</h3>
            <p>In the 2023 high-speed train slapping incident, police decomposed the case into elements like <strong>"initial provocation," "retaliatory force,"</strong> and <strong>"frame-by-frame video analysis,"</strong> quantifying anger into decibel values and dissecting physical confrontations into 17 action nodes...</p>

            <h3>Asynchronous Trial Model</h3>
            <p>Hangzhou Internet Court converts statements into electronic evidence, with AI marking <strong>"voice tremor frequency 0.37Hz"</strong> and <strong>"micro-expression duration 2.4s"</strong>...</p>

            <h2>Epilogue: Emotional Redundancy Check in Cyberspace</h2>
            <p>As metaverse courts adopt EEG monitoring and blockchain contracts incorporate emotional parameters, are we creating a <strong>"Legal Turing Test"</strong>... How should we preserve interpretative space for tears that resist encoding?</p>
