        <h2>Privacy Challenges in Structured Data Management</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence faces three core challenges when processing structured data such as medical records and financial transactions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Algorithmic Bias</strong>: Historical biases in training data can lead to inaccurate medical diagnoses (e.g., skin cancer misdiagnosis due to skin tone)</li>
            <li><strong>Data Gaps</strong>: Financial anti-fraud systems may miss cross-border transaction patterns, reducing model effectiveness</li>
            <li><strong>Data Silos</strong>: Data barriers between supply chain systems impact prediction accuracy</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Mitigation Strategies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Apply Explainable AI (XAI) to eliminate algorithmic decision-making black boxes</li>
            <li>Use synthetic data generation to fill gaps in medical records (GANs technology)</li>
            <li>Deploy federated learning for multi-institutional data collaboration</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Application Case Study</h3>
        <p>After implementing structured data enhancement, a hospital saw a 23% improvement in diagnostic accuracy in radiology and an 18% reduction in misclassification rates for credit scoring models</p>
