            <h2>Introduction: Cosmic Archaeology and the Pursuit of Destiny</h2>
            <p>Galaxy surveys, like a grand "cosmic archaeology," lead us through time and space, tracing the birth and evolution of the universe. Galaxies are not only the "living fossils" of the universe but also the key clues to reveal the ultimate destiny of the cosmos. By observing galaxies at different redshifts, scientists are constructing a "cosmic evolution timeline," unveiling the mysteries of the universe from the dark ages to the formation and evolution of galaxies.</p>

            <h3>Exploring the Early Universe: Galaxy Embryos and Evolutionary Trajectories</h3>
            <p>The early universe was a period full of vitality and uncertainty. Scientists hypothesize that in the first few hundred million years after the birth of the universe, there may have existed "galaxy embryos," or protogalaxies, which were the precursors to future galaxies. These "embryos" gradually grew into "giant" galaxies through the merger of surrounding matter and galaxies.</p>

            <h3>Relics of the Dark Ages: The Veil of the Universe</h3>
            <p>In the first few hundred million years after the birth of the universe, there was a period known as the "dark ages." Due to the lack of sufficient photons, observational evidence from this period is very limited. However, scientists believe that structures such as dark matter halos and primordial gas clouds may have formed during this period, providing a "cradle" for the birth of later galaxies.</p>

            <h3>Galactic Encounters and Collisions: An Inevitability of Cosmic Evolution</h3>
            <p>Galaxies do not exist in isolation but together compose a grand poem of collision and solitude. The encounters and collisions of galaxies are not coincidental but an inevitability of cosmic evolution. These collisions are not just simple physical contacts but exchanges of matter, energy, and information.</p>

            <h3>The Lone Wolf: The Rogue in the Universe</h3>
            <p>In the galactic social network, there are always some "lone wolves" that seem to have broken away from the "social circle" of galaxy clusters, wandering alone in the universe. These solitary galaxies, like rogue figures in the universe, remain a mystery in their birth and wandering, which are still topics of exploration for astronomers.</p>

            <h3>The Galactic Genome: Unlocking the Mysteries of Galaxy Formation</h3>
            <p>Galaxies, like the cells of the universe, constitute the cosmic landscape we observe. Comparing galaxy surveys to the "galactic genome project," studying the "genetic code" of galaxies, i.e., the physical parameters that determine the morphology and evolution of galaxies, is the key to unlocking the ultimate destiny of the universe.</p>

            <h3>Future Prospects: A Farther Universe, A More Accurate Model</h3>
            <p>With the continuous advancement of observational technology, future galaxy surveys will be able to observe a more distant universe, tracing back to the earlier history of the cosmos. New-generation telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), will provide us with unprecedented high-resolution images and data, helping us construct more accurate cosmological models.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion: The Ultimate Destiny of the Universe and Human Exploration</h3>
            <p>Galaxy surveys not only reveal the cosmic evolutionary process but also, through the interactions and evolution of galaxies, unveil the large-scale structure of the universe. By deciphering the "genetic code" of galaxies, we can construct more accurate cosmological models, understand the ultimate destiny of the universe, and explore the origin and evolution of life.</p>
