            <h2>A species within the system, maintaining the stability and efficiency of the entire ecosystem through mutual collaboration and competition. For example, when a production unit fails, other units can automatically take over its tasks, ensuring the continuity of the entire production process. This collaboration capability allows flexible manufacturing systems to function like an organism, with strong resilience and adaptability.</h2>
            <p>The core of flexible manufacturing systems lies in their mechanism of collaboration and competition, enabling the system to maintain stability and efficiency in a complex and ever-changing environment.</p>
