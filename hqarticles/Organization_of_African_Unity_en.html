            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In 1963, the establishment of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) marked a significant step in the African continent's pursuit of political independence and economic liberation. As a practitioner of Pan-Africanism, the OAU not only played a crucial role in opposing colonial rule and apartheid but also laid the groundwork for African unity and self-determination. With the passage of time, the OAU transitioned into the African Union (AU) in 2002, shifting its mission from political independence to economic integration and sustainable development. Entering the digital age, the AU is now redefining Africa's international image through new media platforms and technological innovation, enhancing its influence in global governance and opening new paths for Africa's autonomous development and global cooperation.</p>

            <h2>I. The Ideal and Practice of Pan-Africanism: OAU's Historical Contributions</h2>
            <h3>1.1 The Birth of Pan-Africanism and OAU's Mission</h3>
            <p>As the crystallization of African intellectuals' pursuit of racial equality and independence in the early 20th century, Pan-Africanism emphasizes the unity, self-determination, and liberation of the African people. This ideology not only provided a theoretical foundation for Africa's decolonization but also fueled the establishment of the OAU. The core objectives of the OAU were to promote political independence in Africa, oppose apartheid, and foster unity and cooperation among African nations.</p>
            <h3>1.2 OAU's Historical Achievements</h3>
            <p>The OAU played a pivotal role in Africa's decolonization process. By supporting the independence struggles of countries such as Zimbabwe and Namibia, the OAU accelerated the political independence of the African continent. Additionally, the OAU firmly supported the South African people in their fight against apartheid, applying economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation to pressure the South African authorities, ultimately leading to the end of apartheid. The OAU also provided a platform for African countries to cooperate and coordinate their positions on major international issues, safeguarding the common interests of African nations.</p>

            <h2>II. From Pan-Africanism to African Renaissance: AU's New Vision</h2>
            <h3>2.1 The Transition from OAU to AU</h3>
            <p>With the basic realization of political independence in Africa, the OAU's mission gradually shifted to economic integration and sustainable development. In 1999, the OAU member states unanimously agreed to establish the African Union (AU) with "African Renaissance" as its new vision. The AU inherited the Pan-African ideals of the OAU while placing greater emphasis on sustainable development, peace, and prosperity in Africa.</p>
            <h3>2.2 AU's Core Agenda</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Economic Integration</strong>: The AU is committed to promoting the establishment of a common market among African countries, facilitating trade liberalization and investment through the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), and injecting vitality into Africa's economic development.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure Development</strong>: The AU actively promotes infrastructure development in Africa, improving connectivity between African countries and creating conditions for economic growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Addressing Global Challenges</strong>: The AU actively participates in global governance, safeguarding the interests of African countries in international affairs and providing support for African countries in addressing global challenges such as climate change and food security.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>III. Beyond "Aid": AU Reconstructs a New Narrative for African Development</h2>
            <h3>3.1 From "Aid" to "Cooperation"</h3>
            <p>For a long time, African development has been labeled as "aid," making it synonymous with passive recipients in the global development discourse. The AU is striving to break this stereotype by constructing a new model of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation among African countries, promoting autonomous and sustainable development in Africa.</p>
            <h3>3.2 The African Continental Free Trade Area and the Single African Air Transport Market</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA)</strong>: The launch of the AfCFTA is a milestone in Africa's integration process, aiming to eliminate trade barriers, facilitate the free movement of goods, services, and people, and ultimately form a market with a population of 1.3 billion and a total GDP of $3.4 trillion.</li>
                <li><strong>Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM)</strong>: The SAATM aims to establish a unified air transport market, reducing air transport costs and promoting internal personnel exchanges and trade development in Africa.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.3 Cooperation in Agriculture, Energy, Technology, and Education</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Agriculture</strong>: The AU encourages member states to strengthen agricultural cooperation, promote advanced technologies, enhance food production capacity, and ensure food security.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy</strong>: The AU promotes energy cooperation among member states, building cross-border energy infrastructure and facilitating the development and utilization of energy resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology</strong>: The AU encourages technological cooperation among member states, establishing joint research institutions and promoting the transformation of scientific and technological achievements.</li>
                <li><strong>Education</strong>: The AU promotes educational cooperation among member states, improving education quality and nurturing talent for Africa's development.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>IV. The African Union in the Digital Age: New Media and Global Governance</h2>
            <h3>4.1 New Media Platforms: Amplifying African Voices</h3>
            <p>In the digital age, the AU is actively utilizing social media and short video platforms to amplify "African voices" to the world. Through mainstream platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, as well as short video platforms like TikTok and YouTube, the AU conveys Africa's development achievements, cultural charm, and values to a global audience.</p>
            <h3>4.2 Collaboration for Mutual Benefit: Building a Comprehensive and Objective African Image</h3>
            <p>The AU understands that it cannot fully represent Africa's true image on its own, so it actively seeks cooperation with other international organizations and media institutions. For example, the AU collaborates with UNESCO to organize African Culture Year events and with international mainstream media like BBC and CNN to produce special reports, presenting a more objective view of Africa's development through third-party perspectives.</p>
            <h3>4.3 Technological Empowerment: Enhancing Africa's Influence in Global Governance</h3>
            <p>The AU uses new technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence to enhance its participation and influence in international affairs. For instance, the AU utilizes big data analysis of global hotspots to provide data support for African countries' participation in global governance. Through AI-powered multilingual translation tools, the AU promotes communication and cooperation between Africa and the rest of the world.</p>

            <h2>V. Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
            <h3>5.1 Challenges</h3>
            <p>Although the AU has made significant progress in promoting African development, it still faces numerous challenges. For example, some Western media have deeply entrenched stereotypes about Africa, and the AU needs to make more efforts to reverse these prejudices. Additionally, Africa's digital divide and shortage of technical talent must be addressed through enhanced internal cooperation.</p>
            <h3>5.2 Opportunities</h3>
            <p>The arrival of the digital age presents unprecedented opportunities for the AU. Through new media platforms, the AU can showcase Africa to the world in more intuitive and vivid ways, enhancing Africa's international image and voice. Meanwhile, technological empowerment allows the AU to play a greater role in global governance, opening new avenues for Africa's autonomous development and global cooperation.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

In the digital age, the AU is redefining Africa's international image through new media platforms and technological innovation, enhancing its influence in global governance, and opening new paths for Africa's autonomous development and global cooperation.
