            <h2>Dual Restructuring: The Rise of Small/Medium States and Supply Chain Power</h2>
            <p>The contemporary international order is undergoing two profound power restructurings: small/medium states enhancing geopolitical influence through unconventional means, and technology node companies redefining technological sovereignty within global supply chains. These two forces interact complexly, jointly shaping the future international landscape.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>I. The "Technological Leverage" Phenomenon in Small/Medium States' Rise</h3>
            <p>ASEAN countries leveraging supply chain geographic advantages, Israel's breakthroughs in cybersecurity, Finland establishing discourse power through 5G patents - these cases share a common feature: technological advantage becoming an "asymmetric leverage" for small states against great powers' power projection. In semiconductor industry, TSMC's technological monopoly indirectly elevates Taiwan's special status in global supply chains, forming a "braking mechanism" where tech oligopolies influence great power competition.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>II. The "Quasi-Sovereign Entity" Transformation of Supply Chain Companies</h3>
            <p>Technology companies are transcending traditional commercial roles, evolving into "invisible sovereign entities." ASML's absolute control in lithography machines grants it "technological ambassador" functions; NVIDIA's GPUs become infrastructure for US-EU AI strategies. This transformation breaks the state-corporation binary structure, forming new "technological power matrices" while creating a novel "digital colonialism" - when companies control over 70% of key supply chain nodes, their market decisions effectively yield political consequences surpassing national levels.</p>

            <h3>III. Interactive Effects and Strategic Vacuum from Dual Trends</h3>
            <p>The current international system faces compounded effects of dual power shifts: small/medium states gaining greater bargaining power through technological leverage, while multinational tech companies develop strategic autonomy independent of home countries. This interaction creates new strategic vacuums:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sovereignty Conundrum:</strong> Global collaboration in chip manufacturing forces nations to cede sovereignty to tech companies, exemplified by the US offering $5.3 billion subsidies for TSMC's factory construction</li>
                <li><strong>Technology Standard Wars:</strong> The 6G standard-setting battle between Finland's Nokia, China's Huawei and South Korea's Samsung represents a struggle for technological rule-making dominance between sovereign states and corporate alliances</li>
                <li><strong>Supply Chain Restructuring Games:</strong> Japan's absolute advantage in semiconductor materials (over 70% global photoresist production) makes it a critical variable in US-China-Japan tech competition</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>IV. Three Implications for International Order Restructuring</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Deconstruction of Sovereignty:</strong> Sovereignty competition will shift from traditional territories to control of critical supply chain nodes. Singapore's layout in cleanroom equipment production may hold greater strategic significance than conventional military deployments</li>
                <li><strong>Networked Power Trend:</strong> "Technological enclaves" formed by global supply chains create new power networks. Around ASML's Eindhoven plant, a super-national industrial cluster including Germany's Zeiss and America's Applied Materials may evolve into quasi-power entities</li>
                <li><strong>Small States' "Technological Monroe Doctrine":</strong> Vietnam's investments in rare earth processing and Chile's layout in quantum computing chip materials signal small states constructing new "economic Monroe doctrines" through technological barriers</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In this new era of deep coupling between technological power and state politics, the core of geopolitical competition has shifted from traditional military confrontation to control over critical supply chain nodes. The technological breakthroughs of small/medium states and the quasi-sovereignization of multinational corporations jointly constitute a dual deconstruction of existing international power structures. This power restructuring not only tests traditional powers' strategic resilience but also presents unprecedented challenges for global governance system reforms.</p>
