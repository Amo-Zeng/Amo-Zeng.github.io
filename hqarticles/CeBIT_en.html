            <h3>I. Digital Means Driving Green Transformation</h3>
            <p><strong>Smart Building Management Systems</strong>: CeBIT showcased how AI and IoT technologies can maximize building energy efficiency. Smart building management systems monitor and optimize indoor and outdoor environmental conditions in real-time, such as lighting, HVAC, and ventilation, to minimize energy use while meeting user needs. For example, sensor networks detect indoor and outdoor temperatures, and AI algorithms automatically adjust HVAC settings based on weather forecasts, reducing unnecessary energy consumption. These technologies not only enhance user experience but also significantly reduce energy consumption.</p>
            <p><strong>Green Data Centers</strong>: As major energy consumers in the digital era, data centers were showcased with the latest green solutions at CeBIT. Through efficient cooling technologies (like liquid cooling), renewable energy power supplies, and intelligent power management systems, the carbon footprint of data centers is greatly reduced. For instance, some data centers use solar and wind energy as primary power sources, achieving energy self-sufficiency and minimizing environmental impact.</p>
            <p><strong>Sustainable Energy Solutions</strong>: Big data analytics and predictive models enable better energy management for companies. CeBIT demonstrated how blockchain technology creates traceable green energy trading platforms, ensuring the renewability and sustainability of energy sources. Smart grid technology optimizes power distribution and usage, reducing energy waste and enhancing overall efficiency. These innovations not only help in reducing carbon emissions but also promote efficient energy use.</p>

            <h3>II. Design and Technology of Future Workplaces</h3>
            <p><strong>Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality</strong>: With the rise of remote and hybrid work models, workplace design needs to be more flexible and interactive. CeBIT showed how VR and AR technologies can create virtual offices where employees can collaborate efficiently remotely. For example, with VR headsets, employees can enter virtual meeting rooms for face-to-face interaction; AR overlays real-time work guidance and data visualization, enhancing productivity and interaction.</p>
            <p><strong>Collaboration Platforms</strong>: Modern workplaces emphasize team collaboration and knowledge sharing. CeBIT showcased various collaboration platforms that not only support document sharing and project management but also integrate social features to enhance interaction and collaboration efficiency. For instance, cloud-based tools allow real-time document editing, and video conferences include AI translation features, overcoming language barriers, and enhancing the collaborative experience for global teams, thereby increasing productivity and team cohesion.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>III. Social Technology and Community Building</h3>
            <p><strong>New Features of Social Media Platforms</strong>: CeBIT explored how social media can promote social interaction and community building through technological innovation. Features like virtual communities, social games, and augmented reality social experiences were showcased. These not only increase user engagement but also provide new tools and methods for community management, enhancing interaction and community cohesion.</p>
            <p><strong>Blockchain Technology and Community Trust</strong>: Blockchain technology was presented at CeBIT as a means to establish trust and transparency. Through blockchain, community members can participate in decision-making processes, ensuring every transaction and interaction is transparent and immutable. This is significant for community governance and increasing participation, enhancing trust and self-management capabilities within communities.</p>
            <p><strong>Citizen Engagement and Social Innovation</strong>: Technology is not just a tool but a driver of social change. CeBIT showed how tech platforms can foster citizen engagement, such as online petition systems, citizen science projects, and using big data analytics to optimize public services. Through these technologies, ordinary citizens can more easily engage in social matters, driving social innovation and democratic processes.</p>
