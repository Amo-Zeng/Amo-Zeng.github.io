            <h2>From "Reactive Response" to "Proactive Planning": Managing Decommissioning Costs and Hidden Liabilities in the Circular Economy</h2>
            <p>With technological advancements and economic model transitions, decommissioning issues are no longer confined to simple accounting of "book costs" but have evolved into a comprehensive consideration of a series of "hidden liabilities" including employment impacts, economic downturns, and social issues. Especially in the context of the circular economy, the potential for reusing decommissioned assets and materials is gradually emerging. However, this also brings new challenges such as technological obsolescence, data security, and policy lags. This article aims to explore how to shift from "reactive response" to "proactive planning" by integrating decommissioning costs and resource reuse, establishing a comprehensive hidden liability assessment mechanism, to achieve win-win economic, environmental, and social benefits.</p>

            <h3>Making Hidden Liabilities Explicit: From Book Costs to Social Costs</h3>
            <p>Traditional decommissioning cost accounting systems often focus only on direct financial expenditures such as equipment removal and environmental remediation, ignoring the far-reaching impacts such as employment shocks, economic downturns, and social issues. For example, resource-based cities experiencing resource depletion or industrial policy adjustments result in mass unemployment, forcing local governments to invest heavily in retraining and social security, undoubtedly increasing social costs. Furthermore, the fragmentation of supply chains and the decline of local economies further exacerbate the accumulation of hidden liabilities. Therefore, to truly reflect the economic and social impacts of decommissioning projects, it is essential to establish a comprehensive hidden liability assessment mechanism that includes social costs such as employment shocks, economic downturns, and social issues in the accounting system.</p>

            <h3>From "Burden" to "Treasure": Recycling Decommissioned Assets in the Circular Economy</h3>
            <p>In the circular economy model, decommissioned assets and materials are no longer just "burdens" but hidden "treasures" with significant potential. Through remanufacturing, material recycling, and the development of data assets, decommissioned assets can be utilized efficiently to create new value. For instance, discarded cars can be dismantled, repaired, and modified for reuse; rare metals from old electronic products can be refined for use in new electronic products. These practices not only extend the life of assets, reduce resource consumption but also bring new economic benefits to enterprises. However, how to combine decommissioning costs with the potential revenue from resource reuse remains a topic for further discussion and practice.</p>

            <h3>The Double-Edged Sword of Technological Advances: From "Reactive Response" to "Proactive Planning"</h3>
            <p>The rapid iteration and equipment updates brought by technological advancements, while providing unprecedented opportunities for economic development, also create new challenges. The rapid obsolescence of technology and data security issues leave businesses and governments often unprepared when dealing with decommissioning issues. For example, the large amount of sensitive data stored in decommissioned equipment, if not properly handled, can lead to information leaks, causing immeasurable losses to businesses and individuals. Therefore, businesses and governments need to shift from reactive response to proactive planning, establishing long-term technological obsolescence and decommissioning management plans, systematic data security strategies, and policy regulations that adapt to the rapidly changing technological environment, to address these challenges.</p>

            <h3>Establishing a Comprehensive Hidden Liability Assessment Mechanism: Achieving Sustainable Development</h3>
            <p>To truly reflect the economic and social impacts of decommissioning projects, we need to establish a comprehensive hidden liability assessment mechanism. This mechanism should not only consider book costs but also comprehensively assess social costs such as employment shocks, economic downturns, and social issues. In this way, we can calculate the total cost of decommissioning projects more accurately, providing more comprehensive information support for policymakers. For example, when planning industrial structural adjustments in cities, the government can proactively assess the potential employment shocks and social issues caused by factory closures, and formulate corresponding countermeasures. By improving retraining programs and the social security system, reducing the employment pressure on workers; through diversified industrial development, reducing the dependence of local economies on a single industry; and by improving community construction and public services, mitigating the occurrence of social issues.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In the context of the circular economy and the digital age, decommissioning issues are no longer a simple cost accounting but a complex topic involving economics, society, and technology. By shifting from "reactive response" to "proactive planning," integrating decommissioning costs with resource reuse, and establishing a comprehensive hidden liability assessment mechanism, we can ensure economic development while maintaining social stability and harmony, achieving sustainable development. This is not only a challenge to the traditional method of decommissioning cost accounting but also a test of social governance capabilities. Only through scientific technological obsolescence and decommissioning management plans, systematic data security strategies, and policy regulations that adapt to the rapidly changing technological environment, can we prepare for the future, avoid falling into "technological traps," truly grasp the opportunities brought by technological advancements, and meet the challenges of the digital age.</p>
