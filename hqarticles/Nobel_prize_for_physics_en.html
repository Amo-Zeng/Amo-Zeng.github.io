            <h3>1. Weavers of Time: From Mechanical Clocks to Quantum Gravity</h3>
            <h4>Classical Era Pendulum: Starting Point of Time Measurement</h4>
            <p>The pendulum clock by Huygens in the early 17th century marked the beginning of a new era of precision in time measurement.</p>
            <h4>Electromagnetic Pulse: Quantization of Time</h4>
            <p>Einstein's photoelectric effect revealed the particle nature of light and introduced the concept of quantization.</p>
            <h4>Relativistic Clocks: Relativity of Time</h4>
            <p>Einstein's theory of relativity challenged the concept of absolute time and introduced the relativity of time.</p>
            <h4>Birth of Atomic Clocks: Precision Time Measurement</h4>
            <p>Ramsey's atomic clock uses the stable frequency of atomic energy level transitions to measure time.</p>
            <h4>Exploration of Quantum Gravity: The Essence of Time</h4>
            <p>Peebles' cosmology theory involves research on the Big Bang and dark matter.</p>
