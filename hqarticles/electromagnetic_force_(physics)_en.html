            <h3>1. Basic Principles of Electromagnetic Interactions and Their Multi-scale Impact</h3>
            <p>Electromagnetic interactions are the interactions between charged particles achieved by exchanging photons, which are the core content of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). At the microscopic level, electromagnetic interactions determine the interactions between photons and charged particles such as electrons and protons, thereby affecting the transmission and manipulation of quantum states. At the macroscopic level, electromagnetic interactions not only regulate the transmission of biological electrical signals and rhythm control in living systems but also play a crucial role in the development of new energy sources, such as solar energy, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power generation, and nuclear fusion energy.</p>

            <h3>2. Applications of Electromagnetic Interactions in Quantum Information Processing</h3>
            <p>Quantum information processing relies on electromagnetic interactions to achieve the transmission, manipulation, and readout of quantum states. In quantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum sensing, electromagnetic interactions not only ensure the stable transmission of quantum information but also enhance the efficiency and security of information processing.</p>
            <h4>2.1 Electromagnetic Interactions in Quantum Communication</h4>
            <p>Quantum communication relies on quantum entanglement and the transmission of quantum states. Photons, as the primary information carriers in quantum communication, transmit quantum states through electromagnetic interactions in quantum channels. Electromagnetic interactions ensure the stability and reliability of photons during transmission and influence the generation and maintenance of quantum entanglement, thereby enhancing the security and efficiency of quantum communication.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Electromagnetic Interactions in Quantum Computing</h4>
            <p>In quantum computing, electromagnetic interactions manipulate the states of quantum bits (qubits) through electromagnetic fields. For example, in superconducting quantum computing, microwave photons manipulate qubits through electromagnetic interactions, enabling the preparation, evolution, and measurement of quantum states. Electromagnetic interactions ensure the coupling and interactions between qubits, thereby achieving efficient quantum gate operations and quantum algorithms.</p>
            <h4>2.3 Electromagnetic Interactions in Quantum Sensing</h4>
            <p>Quantum sensing utilizes the sensitivity of quantum systems to detect minute physical quantities. Electromagnetic interactions play a key role in quantum magnetic sensors and quantum optical sensors. For instance, superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) detect minute magnetic field changes through electromagnetic interactions, while quantum optical sensors use the electromagnetic interactions between photons and matter to detect weak electromagnetic fields or optical signals.</p>

            <h3>3. Electromagnetic Interactions and the Symbiotic Relationships in Living Systems</h3>
            <p>Electromagnetic fields are widely present in living systems, from the transmission of biological electrical signals at the cellular level to the behavioral regulation of the entire organism. There is a profound symbiotic relationship between electromagnetic fields and living systems.</p>
            <h4>3.1 Electromagnetic Interactions in Biological Electrical Signal Transmission</h4>
            <p>The functions of the nervous system and heart rely on precise electrical signal transmission. The action potentials of neurons and the electrical activities of the heart are generated under electromagnetic interactions. Electromagnetic fields not only determine the generation of action potentials but also influence the propagation speed and efficiency of electrical signals.</p>
            <h4>3.2 Role of Electromagnetic Fields in Cellular Communication and Biological Rhythm Regulation</h4>
            <p>Cellular communication and the regulation of biological rhythms rely on electromagnetic interactions. For example, some plant cells can sense changes in external electromagnetic fields and adjust their physiological activities accordingly. Electromagnetic fields not only influence the synchronization of biological rhythms but also play an important role in the regulation of the immune system.</p>

            <p>Electromagnetic interactions have immense potential in new energy development, particularly in solar energy, magnetohydrodynamic power generation, and nuclear fusion energy.</p>
            <h4>4.1 Electromagnetic Interactions in Solar Energy Development</h4>
            <p>Solar energy is converted into electrical and thermal energy through the photoelectric effect and thermal effect. The photovoltaic effect is the basis for the operation of solar cells. Photons transfer energy to electrons in semiconductor materials through electromagnetic interactions, causing them to transition to the conduction band, forming free electrons and holes, thereby generating current.</p>
            <h4>4.2 Electromagnetic Interactions in Magnetohydrodynamic Power Generation</h4>
            <p>Magnetohydrodynamic power generation utilizes the motion of high-temperature plasmas in magnetic fields to generate current. Electromagnetic interactions play a crucial role in magnetohydrodynamic power generation. Magnetic fields act on charged particles in plasmas through electromagnetic forces, causing them to move and generate induced current.</p>
            <h4>4.3 Electromagnetic Interactions in Nuclear Fusion Energy</h4>
            <p>Nuclear fusion energy depends on the stable confinement of high-temperature plasmas and the control of high-energy particles. Electromagnetic interactions confine plasmas through magnetic fields, preventing them from contacting container walls and maintaining high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. Electromagnetic interactions also ensure the stability and efficiency of nuclear fusion reactions.</p>
