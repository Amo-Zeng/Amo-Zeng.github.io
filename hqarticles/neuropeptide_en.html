            <h2>The Neural Dark Matter Revolution: A Three-Dimensional Breakthrough from Information Encoding to Intelligent Therapy and Biomimetic Computing</h2>
            <p>In humanity's long journey to understand life and intelligence, we seem to have consistently overlooked a hidden dimension. Just as dark matter constitutes 85% of the universe's mass yet remains difficult to observe directly, the brain also contains a "dark matter network" composed of neuropeptides that silently shapes our thoughts, emotions, and consciousness. This discovery will not only fundamentally change our understanding of the brain's information processing mechanisms but will also lead to revolutionary breakthroughs simultaneously in three major fields: neuroscience, medical therapy, and artificial intelligence. As we turn our attention to this long-neglected world of neural dark matter, a new vision of the nature of intelligence is emergingâ€”from molecular-level information encoding to precise targeting in disease treatment, and to paradigm shifts in biomimetic computing. Neuropeptide research is opening a gateway to future technologies.</p>

            <h3>Neural Dark Matter: The Hidden Dimension of Brain Information Encoding</h3>
            <p>The "electrical signal-centric theory" of <strong>traditional neuroscience</strong> is undergoing a paradigm shift. In the past, scientists simplified neuronal activity as the transmission of electrical pulses, much like astronomers initially focused only on visible celestial bodies while ignoring dark matter. However, increasing evidence suggests the existence of a "<strong>chemical dark matter network</strong>" in the brain composed of neuropeptides, which participates in information encoding in a completely different way, adding rich dimensions to neural computation.</p>
            
            <p>The operating mechanisms of the neuropeptide system contrast sharply with the electrical signal system. In terms of time scale, electrical signals transmit rapidly at millisecond speeds, while neuropeptides can act from seconds to hours; spatially, electrical signals propagate along specific neural pathways, whereas neuropeptides diffuse to influence broad regions; informationally, electrical signals use "digital" pulse frequency encoding, while neuropeptides provide "analog" concentration gradient encoding. This <strong>dual coding system</strong> enables the brain to simultaneously process rapid responses and long-term regulation, achieving information integration across multiple time scales.</p>
            
            <p>The discovery of neuropeptides has fundamentally changed our understanding of synaptic plasticity. Taking brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as an example, it not only regulates synaptic strength but also affects neuronal growth and survival through complex <strong>molecular cascade reactions</strong>. When BDNF binds to TrkB receptors, it activates multiple intracellular signaling pathways, ultimately leading to changes in gene expression. This multi-level regulation from fast to slow makes the neuropeptide system a bridge connecting neural activity with gene expression, providing a new perspective for understanding the molecular basis of learning and memory.</p>

            <h3>Therapeutic Revolution: A Paradigm Shift in Neuropeptide-Targeted Therapies</h3>
            <p>Treatment of <strong>neuropsychiatric disorders</strong> faces significant bottlenecks, as traditional drugs often target single receptors and struggle to address the brain's complexity. The discovery of the neuropeptide system provides a new approach to disease treatment, with its <strong>multi-target regulation</strong> properties naturally aligning with the brain's networked operation, promising a paradigm shift from "symptom control" to "network repair."</p>
            
            <p>The field of depression treatment has already witnessed this transformation. Traditional SSRI drugs only increase serotonin concentration in the synaptic cleft, while neuropeptide systems such as substance P antagonists and CRF receptor modulators can simultaneously affect mood, stress response, and neuroplasticity. Recent studies show that combined targeting of neuropeptide and monoamine systems significantly improves treatment response rates, suggesting that <strong>multi-system synergy</strong> is the future direction. Even more exciting is that certain neuropeptides like oxytocin can directly regulate social cognition, offering new hope for autism spectrum disorders.</p>
            
            <p>Neuropeptide drug development also faces unique challenges. Because peptides are easily degraded, scientists have developed various innovative strategies: enhancing stability through <strong>structural modifications</strong>, such as cyclized peptides; using nanocarriers to cross the blood-brain barrier, like liposome encapsulation; designing non-peptide small molecules to mimic peptide conformations, such as NK1 receptor antagonists. These technological breakthroughs have made it possible to move neuropeptide drugs from the lab to the clinic, with over 40 neuropeptide drugs currently in clinical trials covering pain, obesity, mental disorders, and other fields.</p>

            <h3>Biomimetic Computing: A New Paradigm of Intelligence Inspired by Neuropeptides</h3>
            <p><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> development is facing bottlenecks, as traditional neural networks lack the adaptability and robustness of biological nervous systems. The discovery of neuropeptide systems provides fresh inspiration for AI research, with their <strong>dynamic regulation mechanisms</strong> representing the key missing elements in current AI. By simulating the multi-level regulation of neuropeptides, we may develop a new generation of biomimetic intelligent systems.</p>
            
            <p>Neuropeptide-inspired algorithms have shown potential in multiple areas. In robot control, simulating the <strong>slow modulation</strong> of neuropeptides enables robots to adapt to environmental changes; in machine learning, introducing "meta-regulation" mechanisms similar to neuropeptides allows networks to automatically adjust learning rates and attention allocation; in brain-like computing, peptide-like signals enable state-dependent computation similar to biological nervous systems. These innovations bring AI systems closer to the flexibility and adaptability of biological intelligence.</p>
            
            <p>The cutting-edge breakthrough in this field is the integration of <strong>neuromorphic computing chips</strong> with peptide-like regulation. The "neuropeptide chip" developed by a team at MIT combines traditional electrical signal pathways with chemical diffusion simulating peptides.</p>
