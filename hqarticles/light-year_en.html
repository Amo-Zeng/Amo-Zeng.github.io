            <p>On a quiet night, when you gaze up at a distant star, what you see is not its "present" state, but its <b>past</b>. If the star lies 100 light-years away, you are seeing the light it emitted <b>100 years ago</b>—the twilight of the Qing Dynasty, the era when Einstein was formulating relativity. What you observe is not real-time reality, but a cosmic "video tape," and you are its sole viewer.</p>

            <p>Our everyday act of "seeing," on a cosmic scale, becomes a <b>delayed ritual of cognition</b>. The light-year has transcended its simple definition as a unit of distance to become a <b>triple measure of human cognition, existence, and communication in the universe</b>. It is not merely a spatial scale, but also a measure of <b>cognitive delay, existential divide, and cultural entropy</b>. Through these three dimensions, the light-year defines humanity's place in the cosmos—and reveals the dignity of the human spirit.</p>

            <hr class="section-separator">

            <h2>I. Delayed Broadcast: The Light-Year as a "Temporal Ruler" of Cognition</h2>
            <p>On Earth, light speed feels instantaneous. Sunlight reaches us in just 8 minutes—so we perceive the Sun as "live." But on a cosmic scale, this illusion of immediacy collapses entirely.</p>
            <p>The JADES-GS-z13-0 galaxy, observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, has a light-travel time of <b>13.5 billion years</b>. What we see is the universe just 300 million years after its birth—its "infancy." We are not studying the "present" universe, but <b>replaying its childhood video</b>. Every observation is an act of <b>cosmic archaeology</b>: reconstructing stellar evolution from photons, piecing together the future from fragments of the past.</p>
            <p>More profoundly, this delay is not a technological flaw, but a <b>physical inevitability</b>. The speed of light is the upper limit for information transfer. Even with future advanced detectors, the information delay across light-years will remain a fundamental constraint on human understanding of the cosmos. We can never know "now" whether Proxima Centauri has gone supernova—we must wait 4.2 years for its light to reach Earth.</p>
            <p>In 2017, LIGO detected gravitational waves from a neutron star merger, alongside electromagnetic signals. But both arrived with a <b>130-million-year delay</b>. Even gravitational waves, though "cleaner" than light, are still bound by the speed of light. The light-year thus becomes the "latency constant" of cosmic information transmission.</p>
            <blockquote>
                This shakes the foundation of modern science: <b>Can science only ever know the past?</b> We build models, test theories, and predict the future—but all our data is "expired." Our observations of the Milky Way's central black hole are 43,000 years old; our view of Andromeda is 2.5 million years old. We are like historians, reconstructing the present from fragments, unable to witness events firsthand.
            </blockquote>
            <p>The light-year is therefore not just a spatial scale, but a <b>cognitive scale</b>. It teaches us: <b>The greatness of science lies not in how far it can see, but in its ability to believe in the existence of light, even where it cannot be seen.</b></p>

            <hr class="section-separator">

            <h2>II. The Transparent Wall: The Light-Year as a Symbol of Existential Divide</h2>
            <p>Yet even when we "see" worlds beyond light-years through telescopes, we cannot "reach" them. The light-year becomes a <b>transparent wall</b>: visible, but impassable; calculable, but untouchable.</p>
            <p>We can precisely calculate the orbit, mass, and atmospheric composition of Proxima b, even estimate its surface temperature. But "calculation" is not "understanding." We cannot know: If life exists there, does it possess consciousness? Language? Does it, too, gaze at the stars, wondering about us? The light-year becomes a <b>cognitive prison</b>: the more we use scientific tools to approach it, the more we realize we are trapped within an anthropocentric framework.</p>
            <blockquote>
                This recalls the "brain in a vat" thought experiment: a brain sustained only by electrical signals, severed from its body—can it know whether it is in a simulation? On a cosmic scale, human civilization may be the universe's "brain in a vat"—receiving photons from the cosmos, yet unable to confirm the "reality" behind the signals.
            </blockquote>
            <p>Heidegger's concept of <i>In-der-Welt-sein</i> ("Being-in-the-world") holds that humans are not isolated subjects, but beings <b>co-existing</b> with others and nature. But across light-years, this "co-existence" is severed. We cannot "co-exist" with life beyond light-years—we cannot share time, space, or experience. The light-year becomes an <b>existential isolation belt</b>.</p>
            <p>Levinas argued that the "Other" cannot be assimilated or fully understood. But across light-years, the "cosmic Other" is not merely <b>unassimilable</b>—it is <b>unreachable, unresponsive</b>. The Arecibo Message we sent into space may receive a reply, if one exists, only after centuries or millennia. The light-year becomes an <b>abyss of response</b>.</p>
            <blockquote>
                This is worse than silence—<b>we do not know if the Other exists, nor if it wishes to be understood by us</b>. The light-year defines humanity's <b>cosmic loneliness</b>: the more precisely we measure, the more we realize we are but a speck of dust, imprisoned within the cage of light speed and causality.
            </blockquote>
            <p>Yet it is precisely before this "transparent wall" that the human spirit reveals itself: <b>we choose to gaze, knowing we cannot reach</b>. This is not futility, but an existential stance—facing cosmic silence, we answer with our gaze; confronting nothingness, we respond with thought.</p>

            <hr class="section-separator">

            <h2>III. Echoes of Civilization: The Light-Year as a Unit of Cultural Entropy</h2>
            <p>What we send into the cosmos is not just signals, but <b>echoes of civilization</b>. But the light-year is precisely the <b>attenuation coefficient</b> of these echoes.</p>
            <p>In 1974, humanity sent the Arecibo Message to the M13 star cluster—a cosmic postcard woven in binary code, depicting humans, Earth, DNA, and telescopes. But the light-year strips away context, dilutes emotion, and distorts intent with every parsec. <b>Each light-year is a depreciation of cultural fidelity</b>.</p>
            <p>In 1977, Voyager 1 carried the Golden Record, like a cosmic troubadour bearing Earth's sounds: Bach's fugues, China's "Jasmine Flower," a mother's voice... But Carl Sagan was clear: <b>these are "rootless words"</b>. The light-year severs culture from its "synchronous context"—like tossing a Tang poem into a black hole and retrieving it as a meaningless waveform.</p>
            <blockquote>
                In communication theory, "information entropy" is here made concrete: <b>the farther in light-years, the more misinterpretation, the more uncertain the meaning</b>. Our "peace signal" might be read as a "coordinate beacon"; our art, as a "frequency map of energy." The light-year forces us to "compress" ourselves in transmission—reducing complex civilizations to symbol sets, diverse voices to a single record.
            </blockquote>
            <p>More chillingly: <b>the light-year may lead to the total alienation of the self</b>. If another civilization receives the Golden Record 100,000 years from now and constructs a model of "Earth civilization," it will be based on oversimplified symbols, not real history. We will become their imagined "Other"—not "who we are," but "how they understand us."</p>
            <p>The light-year is the "silence coefficient" of cultural transmission. Yet it is precisely in this <b>inevitably distorted communication</b> that humanity reveals a deeper courage: <b>we choose to express, knowing meaning will fade</b>.</p>
            <blockquote>
                This is no longer communication, but a <b>ritual of self-affirmation</b>. We send not "information," but a "declaration of existence"—even if the universe remains silent, even if echoes vanish, we still say: "We were here. We thought. We sang."
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Conclusion: Light-Year Humanism—Defining Human Dignity Amid Delay, Divide, and Entropy</h2>
            <p>The light-year is a delayed broadcast, a transparent wall, an echo of civilization. It tells us:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We can never "live" know the present moment of the cosmos;</li>
                <li>We may never truly "reach" the cosmic Other;</li>
                <li>Our transmitted messages will ultimately be distorted, simplified, and alienated.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Yet it is precisely in this <b>inevitably failed transmission</b> that humanity reveals a tragic dignity: <b>we choose to express, knowing meaning will be lost</b>.</p>
            <p>This is not for understanding, but for <b>affirming existence</b>. Like early humans painting bison on cave walls—not for accurate interpretation, but to say: "I saw it. I existed." The light-year transforms interstellar communication into a <b>cosmic ritual</b>—we send messages, not for dialogue, but to <b>leave a trace in the void</b>.</p>
            <blockquote>
                We do not send "who we are," but "that we existed."<br>
                We know the echo will be distorted, yet we still shout.<br>
                Because—<br>
                <b>At the end of the light-year, even if no one hears,<br>
                the human voice is still worth being spoken.</b>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This, then, is the essence of <b>Light-Year Humanism</b>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In delayed cognition, we develop mathematics and imagination;</li>
                <li>In existential divide, we learn humility and questioning;</li>
                <li>In cultural entropy, we still choose to express.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Light-Year Humanism</b> is a redefined humanistic stance on a cosmic scale:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It acknowledges the limits of knowledge, yet uses science as a lamp to illuminate the unknown;</li>
                <li>It accepts existential loneliness, yet uses the gaze as a bridge to connect silent infinity;</li>
                <li>It confronts the distortion of communication, yet uses expression as a flame to ignite the faint glow of civilization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It tells us: <b>The true mark of civilization is not how far it can see,<br>
            but—<br>
            in the unseen, still believing in light;<br>
            in the unresponsive depths of the cosmos, still choosing to speak.</b></p>
            <p>The light-year is not merely a cosmic scale, but a <b>measure of the human spirit</b>.<br>
            It reminds us:<br>
            <b>We may be small, but our thought can transcend light speed;<br>
            We may be lonely, but our expression can cross time;<br>
            We may be fleeting, but our dignity is as eternal as light.</b></p>
