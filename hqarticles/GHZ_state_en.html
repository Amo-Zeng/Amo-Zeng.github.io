            <h2>Exploring the Quantum Entanglement Power of GHZ States: Design and Frontiers of High-Precision Quantum Sensors</h2>
            <p>Quantum technology is revolutionizing the way we perceive the world, and quantum sensors are at the forefront of this transformation. By leveraging the unique properties of quantum mechanics—entanglement and coherence—they achieve performance boundaries that traditional sensors cannot reach. GHZ states (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states), as a typical multi-particle entangled state, exhibit unparalleled entanglement strength, offering new possibilities for the design of quantum sensors. This article aims to deeply explore the intrinsic properties of GHZ states and their application potential in quantum sensors, revealing their profound impact in high-precision measurement fields.</p>

            <h3>Quantum Entanglement in GHZ States: Principles and Potential</h3>
            <p>GHZ states are a type of maximally entangled state in multi-particle systems, mathematically represented as:</p>
            <p><code>\[ |\text{GHZ}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|000\rangle + |111\rangle) \]</code></p>
            <p>The uniqueness of this state lies in its tight coupling of quantum states of multiple particles, forming a global entangled structure. Any fluctuation in the state of a single particle instantly affects the others, a kind of non-local correlation that is unimaginable in classical physics.</p>
