            <h2>Depression: An Overlooked Mental Health Warning</h2>
            <p>In modern society, depression has become a widespread mental health issue. People often liken depression to a "mental cold," attempting to describe this complex psychological disorder in a lighthearted manner. However, behind this metaphor lies a deeper question: If depression is truly as common as a cold, why is it still so widely misunderstood and overlooked? This neglect is not only reflected in the public's lack of knowledge about depression but also in the prejudice and discrimination against those suffering from it. To change this situation, we need to redefine the public's perception of depression and establish a more rational and inclusive framework of understanding.</p>

            <h3>From "Emo" to Depression: The Emotional Dilemma in the Social Media Era</h3>
            <p>"Emo," a term originating from the post-punk culture of the 1990s, has been given new meaning in social media. It no longer merely represents a music style or fashion trend but has become a label for emotional expression, a way for young people to voice their inner pain, confusion, and loneliness. However, when "emo" floods social media, when negative emotions are amplified endlessly, and when the desire for empathy evolves into collective anxiety, we must consider: In an era deeply infiltrated by social media, could "emo" evolve into a more severe emotional dilemma, even a breeding ground for depression?</p>

            <h3>The "Invisible Armor" of Depression Patients: Exploring the Path to Self-Healing</h3>
            <p>Depression is a complex psychological disorder that not only affects the emotions and quality of life of patients but also has profound implications for their families and society. Although treatment for depression requires professional medical intervention, more and more patients are actively exploring self-healing methods alongside professional treatment. These self-healing methods act as an "invisible armor," helping them find inner strength and hope in their battle against the disease.</p>

            <h3>The Deep Meaning of Self-Healing: From "Confrontation" to "Coexistence"</h3>
            <p>The significance of self-healing goes beyond symptom relief; it helps patients find a balanced lifestyle in long-term coexistence with depression. Depression is not a disease that can be eradicated overnight, and patients need to learn how to "coexist" with it on the foundation of professional treatment. Through self-healing, they gradually realize that depression is not the entirety of life but a reality that needs to be accepted and managed.</p>

            <h3>Practical Guidelines for Self-Healing: Starting with Small Changes</h3>
            <p>Although self-healing methods are diverse, the most important thing for depression patients is to find a way that suits them and start with small changes. Here are some practical suggestions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Progress gradually, without rushing results</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Document the healing journey to enhance self-awareness</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Seek social support to avoid isolation</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Cultivate patience and accept imperfection</strong></li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Depression is a tough journey, but self-healing offers a path to the inner self. This "invisible armor" may not completely shield patients from the disease, but it provides refuge, helping them find light in the darkness. Through continuous trial and exploration, depression patients can gradually learn to coexist with the disease and find their own strength and hope in the process of self-healing. The meaning of life may lie in every small change and every act of perseverance.</p>
