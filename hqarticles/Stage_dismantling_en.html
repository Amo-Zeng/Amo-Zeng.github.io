            <h2>"Invasion" of the Stage and the "Temporary Reconstruction" of the City</h2>
            <p>The construction of a stage often signifies the impending start of a grand event. Whether it's a concert, a theatrical performance, or a commercial exhibition, the stage's presence changes the public space of the city in a short period. It not only occupies the original sidewalks and squares but may also alter the traffic flow. This "invasion" seems to be a disruption of the city's order, but in fact, it is also a "temporary reconstruction."</p>

            <h3>The Meaning of the Void: The City's "Blank Space" and Reflection</h3>
            <p>After the stage is dismantled, a void is left behind. On the surface, this void is a temporary "vacancy" of the urban space, but in reality, it is a special "blank space." This "blank space" is not just physical; it is also psychological. It reminds us that the city's space is not always "full," and a moderate "emptiness" can bring more possibilities to the city.</p>

            <h3>Deconstruction: The Fragmentation of Memory</h3>
            <p>The stage itself is a process of aggregation. The lights, scenery, music, dialogue, and even the emotional atmosphere in the air during the performance leave deep imprints in the hearts of the audience and actors. Each detail is like a cornerstone of memory, collectively constructing a complete framework of collective memory. However, when the stage is dismantled, these cornerstones are peeled away, and the integrity of the memory begins to collapse.</p>

            <h3>Reconstruction: The Recreation of Memory</h3>
            <p>However, the deconstruction of memory does not mean its end but a new beginning. Although the stage no longer exists, the fragments of memory do not truly disappear; they are recombined in another form. Word of mouth from the audience is the initial method of reconstruction. A particular joke or moving moment from the performance, conveyed through speech, reassembles into new memories.</p>

            <h3>Disenchantment: Re-examining Perfection</h3>
            <p>The stage is the ultimate imagination of human pursuit of perfection. The glittering scenery, precise coordination, and flawless performances together construct a dreamlike fantasy space. This meticulously crafted portrayal of "perfection" has captivated and enchanted countless people. But when the stage is dismantled, the lights are extinguished, and the scenery collapses, we are forced to face a harsh reality: perfection has never existed.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Hope and Reality in the Void</h3>
            <p>The void left after the stage is dismantled is a temporary "blank space" of the city and the starting point of the fragmentation and recreation of collective memory. This void is not only physical but also psychological and social. It prompts us to reflect on the "emptiness" and "fullness" of the city and to consider how to fill the urban space while retaining a moderate "blank space."</p>
