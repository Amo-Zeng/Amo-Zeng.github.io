            <h2>Connection Between Quantum Gravity and Galactic Scales: Exploration and Application in Cross-Scale Cosmology</h2>
            <p>The universe, an endless stage, presents a magnificent epic spanning micro and macro realms. Under the pillars of modern physics, quantum mechanics and general relativity, significant achievements have been made in the study of microscopic particles and the macroscopic universe. However, when we turn our gaze to galactic scales, the harmonious unification of these two theories becomes a pressing issue. The grand vision of quantum gravity theory, aiming to integrate the quantum world with the gravitational world at the smallest scales, is gradually unveiling many mysteries at galactic scales, opening up an in-depth exploration of cross-scale cosmology.</p>

            <h3>Applications of Quantum Gravity Theory</h3>
            <p>Quantum gravity theories, including string theory and loop quantum gravity, provide us with a new perspective to examine the formation and evolution of galaxies. String theory posits that the fundamental constituents of the universe are not traditional point-like particles but tiny, one-dimensional strings. These strings manifest in various forms under different vibrational modes, corresponding to various fundamental particles in the universe. The introduction of string theory not only challenges our traditional understanding of fundamental particles but also offers new possibilities for understanding the microscopic structure of dark matter and its distribution in galaxies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microstructure of Dark Matter:</strong> Under the framework of string theory, the microstructure and distribution of dark matter are reexamined, deepening our understanding of galaxy rotation curves and overall stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantized Spacetime:</strong> Loop quantum gravity theory approaches from the essence of spacetime, suggesting that spacetime at the Planck scale is quantized, composed of tiny "loops". This quantized spacetime may have significant effects at galactic scales, influencing the distribution of matter and dynamic evolution within galaxies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Concept of Cross-Scale Information Transfer</h3>
            <p>The concept of cross-scale information transfer further deepens our understanding of galactic evolution. From the microscopic fundamental particles to the macroscopic galactic structures, information transfer and integration weave the lifeline of the universe across different scales. The interactions between fundamental particles form the most basic communication network of the universe, exchanging energy and information through quantum mechanics to create structures at atomic, molecular, and even larger scales. Stars, as the basic building blocks of galaxies, transmit stellar information and influence the distribution and dynamic evolution of matter in galaxies through nuclear fusion reactions. The interactions and mergers between galaxies are significant drivers of galactic evolution, with gravitational lensing effects, heating and cooling of the intergalactic medium, and the distribution of dark matter, all being manifestations of cross-scale information transfer.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In summary, the connection between quantum gravity and galactic scales is a field full of challenges and opportunities. By exploring this connection, we not only have the potential to unravel many mysteries of galaxy formation and evolution but may also touch upon the deepest secrets of the universe. This is not only a significant test for existing physical theories but also a great challenge to human intellect. On the journey of science, we are gradually unveiling the mysterious veil of the universe, advancing towards deeper and broader cosmic truths. The theoretical framework of cross-scale information transfer provides us with a comprehensive perspective to understand the cosmic evolution from microscopic particles to macroscopic galaxies, revealing the intrinsic connections between different scales in the universe, offering us new methodologies to explore the mysteries of the universe. With the advancement of observational technologies and theoretical models, we have reason to believe that cross-scale information transfer will continue to lead us deep into the core of galactic evolution, unveiling deeper secrets of the universe.</p>
