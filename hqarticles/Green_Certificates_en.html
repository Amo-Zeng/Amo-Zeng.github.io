            <h2>Green Certificate: Empowering Sustainable Development in Multiple Dimensions</h2>
            <p>In the context of increasingly severe global environmental issues, green certificates, as an innovative tool, are empowering sustainable development in multiple dimensions. This article will explore the implementation pathways, specific cases, and future prospects of green certificates from three novel perspectives—as a "digital business card" for personal ecological influence, a "smart assistant" for green consumption, and a "bridge and bond" for international green cooperation.</p>

            <h3>I. As a "Digital Business Card" for Personal Ecological Influence</h3>
            <p>In the digital age, an individual's influence no longer relies solely on traditional interpersonal interactions and offline engagement but is widely disseminated and amplified through digital channels. Personal ecological influence, i.e., an individual's influence within the digital ecosystem, has become a new type of "digital business card."</p>
