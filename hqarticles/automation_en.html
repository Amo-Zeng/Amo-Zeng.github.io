            <h2>Automation: From Efficiency to Humanity, Opening a New Era of Cross-Industry Integration</h2>
            <p>Automation technology, once merely regarded as an "efficiency tool," is now reshaping our world in a completely new way. It is not just a tool to enhance productivity; it is also a catalyst for human creativity, a challenger to ethical thinking, and a driver of cross-industry integration. In this wave of automation, we need to explore the opportunities and challenges it brings with a broader perspective and deeper thinking.</p>

            <h3>From "Efficiency First" to "Human-Centered Design": Ethical Considerations in Automation</h3>
            <p>In the past, automation devices were often seen as synonymous with "efficiency first." However, as their applications expanded, ethical issues related to automation devices began to emerge, prompting us to re-examine their development direction.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Dilemma of Efficiency First:</strong> Automation devices have brought about issues such as blurred boundaries between humans and machines, human alienation, and indifference towards life.</li>
                <li><strong>Human-Centered Design:</strong> The ultimate goal of automation devices should be to serve humans, not to enslave them.</li>
            </ul>
