            <h4>Technical Challenges</h4>
            <p>Although Mars' environment is harsh, it is not entirely insurmountable. Mars has extremely low surface temperatures, a thin atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide, lacks oxygen, and has high radiation levels, all of which pose challenges to human survival. However, scientists have proposed various solutions, such as building closed ecological systems, using 3D printing technology to construct living facilities, and developing soil for planting crops on Mars. These technologies have already demonstrated a certain level of theoretical feasibility.</p>
            <h4>Economic and Ethical Challenges</h4>
            <p>Achieving Mars colonization requires enormous economic investment. From rocket launches to the construction of living facilities on Mars, each step requires significant financial support. Additionally, Mars colonization raises numerous ethical questions: Who should have priority for Mars colonization? How can fairness in Mars colonization be ensured? These questions not only involve technology and economics but also touch on social equity and justice.</p>

            <h3>3. Mars Terraforming: From the "Red Planet" to the "Blue Planet"</h3>
            <p>Mars terraforming is the ultimate challenge for humanity in conquering nature and the grand blueprint for interstellar colonization. The core of Mars terraforming lies in creating an ecosystem similar to Earth, enabling it to support life. Specifically, the scientific principles of Mars terraforming include atmospheric transformation, water resource development, and soil improvement.</p>
            <h4>Atmospheric Transformation</h4>
            <p>Mars' atmospheric pressure is only 1% of Earth's, primarily composed of carbon dioxide. By introducing greenhouse gases (such as methane) and utilizing Mars' own carbon dioxide, atmospheric pressure and temperature can be increased, creating a greenhouse effect.</p>
            <h4>Water Resource Development</h4>
            <p>Mars' polar ice caps and subsurface ice contain abundant water resources. By heating and melting these ice deposits, liquid water can be obtained, providing the necessary water source for life.</p>
            <h4>Soil Improvement</h4>
            <p>Mars' soil is rich in iron oxides, giving it a red color. By adding organic matter and microorganisms, the soil can be improved to make it suitable for plant growth.</p>
            <p>However, Mars terraforming requires breakthroughs in multiple technical bottlenecks, such as remote control, resource utilization, and ecosystem construction. Moreover, achieving full habitability may take centuries or even longer.</p>
