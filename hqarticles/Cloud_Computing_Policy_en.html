            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of cutting-edge technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G communication, and artificial intelligence (AI), the global demand for data generation and processing has grown exponentially. In this context, edge computing has emerged, bringing computational power closer to the network edge, significantly reducing data processing latency and enhancing user experience. However, the rise of edge computing has also posed new challenges to traditional cloud computing models. Meanwhile, the acceleration of global digital transformation has made cloud computing an important engine for driving economic development and improving production efficiency. However, the issue of data sovereignty has gradually come to the forefront, becoming a focal point of attention for governments and enterprises worldwide. Additionally, resource-constrained and technologically under-resourced small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face numerous challenges during digital transformation. How to construct a policy framework for the synergistic development of edge computing and cloud computing, balance data flow and sovereignty protection, and promote SME digital transformation has become a critical issue for policymakers worldwide.</p>

            <h2>3. Cloud Computing Policies from the Perspective of Data Sovereignty</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Definition and Importance of Data Sovereignty</h3>
            <p>Data sovereignty refers to a country's complete control and management over data generated within its borders, including data collection, storage, processing, and transmission throughout its entire lifecycle. As global data flows accelerate, the importance of data sovereignty has become increasingly prominent, involving national security, economic development, and personal privacy protection.</p>
            <h3>3.2 Global Cloud Computing Market Landscape and Policy Differences</h3>
            <p>Currently, the global cloud computing market is highly concentrated, dominated by U.S. tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Meanwhile, cloud computing enterprises in regions like China and Europe are also rapidly rising, forming certain regional competitive advantages. There are significant policy differences regarding data sovereignty among countries:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>United States</strong>: Adopts a relatively open attitude, encouraging data free flow, but also strengthens control over cross-border data through laws like the CLOUD Act.</li>
                <li><strong>European Union</strong>: Strengthens data sovereignty protection through regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), limiting cross-border data transfers.</li>
                <li><strong>China</strong>: Clarifies data sovereignty through laws like the Cybersecurity Law and the Data Security Law, restricting the export of critical data and promoting the development of domestic cloud computing enterprises.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.3 Impact of Data Sovereignty on Cloud Computing Policies</h3>
            <p>Data sovereignty requires data storage and processing to occur within the country, directly affecting the construction and layout of cloud computing infrastructure. Simultaneously, the strengthening of data sovereignty means stricter restrictions on cross-border data flows, which may have a certain inhibitory effect on technological innovation.</p>
