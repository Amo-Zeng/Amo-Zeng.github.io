            <h3>I. From “Data Sovereignty” to “Computing Sovereignty”: The Extension of National Security</h3>
            <p>The rise of cloud computing has centralized data storage and computing power in the cloud, challenging the traditional concept of “data sovereignty.” In this context, “computing sovereignty” has emerged as a new focus for countries to defend their national sovereignty.</p>
            <h4>1. The Meaning and Significance of “Computing Sovereignty”</h4>
            <p>“Computing Sovereignty” focuses not only on the storage and jurisdiction of data but also on the control of data processing capabilities and computing resources. Its core includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Control of Critical Data Processing Capabilities</strong>: Countries must ensure they have the processing capabilities for critical data involving national security, economic lifelines, and social stability, avoiding reliance on external forces.</li>
                <li><strong>Autonomous Control of Cloud Infrastructure</strong>: By developing domestic cloud infrastructure, countries can reduce reliance on foreign cloud service providers and enhance data security and controllability.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulation of Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence</strong>: Governments must regulate algorithms and AI that affect national interests and social fairness, preventing algorithmic discrimination and algorithmic hegemony.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Policy Games and Market Segmentation</h4>
            <p>Countries enforce “computing sovereignty” through measures such as data localization requirements, cloud service procurement restrictions, and data跨境 flow regulation. For example, China’s Cybersecurity Law requires critical data to be stored domestically, while the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes strict restrictions on the cross-border transfer of personal data. These policies have led to regional segmentation in the global cloud computing market, increasing market entry barriers and intensifying competition between local enterprises and international giants.</p>
            <h4>3. International Cooperation and Digital Sovereignty Games</h4>
            <p>The rise of “computing sovereignty” has not only intensified international competition in the digital economy but also provided new opportunities for transnational cooperation. Countries need to strengthen cooperation in data governance and technology standardization to prevent the rise of digital protectionism. However, the game around “computing sovereignty” may also lead to fragmentation of the technological ecosystem, hindering the coordinated development of the global digital economy.</p>

            <h3>II. From “Individual Privacy” to “Organizational Privacy”: New Privacy Challenges in the Cloud Computing Environment</h3>
            <p>With enterprise data migrating to the cloud, protecting “organizational privacy” has become a core issue in the cloud computing era. Compared to traditional “individual privacy,” “organizational privacy” involves sensitive information such as trade secrets, customer data, and intellectual property, making its protection more challenging and crucial.</p>
            <h4>1. Threats to “Organizational Privacy”</h4>
            <p>In the cloud computing environment, “organizational privacy” faces multiple threats:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities of Cloud Service Providers</strong>: As data custodians, security vulnerabilities or improper actions by internal personnel of cloud service providers can directly threaten customer data security.</li>
                <li><strong>Cyberattacks</strong>: The openness and sharing nature of cloud computing make it a primary target for cybercriminals.</li>
                <li><strong>Insider Threats</strong>: Malicious actions by employees or third-party partners within an organization can also lead to data breaches.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Policy and Regulatory Push and Challenges</h4>
            <p>Governments around the world have strengthened the protection of “organizational privacy” through data protection and cybersecurity laws. For example, the EU’s GDPR requires companies to implement stringent data protection measures, while China’s Cybersecurity Law emphasizes the security responsibilities of network operators. While these regulations promote innovation in cloud security technology, they also increase compliance costs for businesses.</p>
            <h4>3. Cloud Computing Technology Empowering Security</h4>
            <p>Enterprises can build a more robust “organizational privacy” protection system through data encryption, access control, and security audits. For instance, data encryption can prevent decryption risks after data leakage, while strict access control mechanisms can effectively restrict unauthorized access.</p>

            <h3>III. From “Technology Neutrality” to “Technological Bias”: The New Logic of Policy-Making</h3>
            <p>Governments around the world are gradually shifting from traditional “technology neutrality” to more biased “technological bias” policies in the cloud computing field. This shift not only reshapes market competition but also has profound implications for technological innovation and international trade relations.</p>
            <h4>1. Driving Factors of “Technological Bias”</h4>
            <p>“Technological Bias” policies are driven by the following factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>National Security</strong>: As critical information infrastructure, cloud computing directly relates to national information security and sovereignty.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial Development</strong>: Cloud computing is a core driver of the digital economy, and governments aim to promote the development of domestic enterprises through policy support.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Autonomy</strong>: Reducing reliance on external technologies to ensure autonomy and controllability in key areas.</li>
                <li><strong>International Competition</strong>: Supporting domestic enterprises to gain an advantageous position in the global market through policy tools.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Policy Impacts and Market Dynamics</h4>
            <p>“Technological Bias” policies have profound impacts on market competition, technological innovation, and international trade:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Market Competitive Landscape Changes</strong>: Policy support enables domestic enterprises to dominate the local market, which may lead to regional monopolies.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Innovation Dynamics</strong>: Government support encourages increased R&D investment by enterprises, but excessive protection may stifle market vitality.</li>
                <li><strong>Tensions in International Trade Relations</strong>: Policy differences may exacerbate global trade friction, affecting the stability of international economic relations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Balancing “Technological Bias” and “Technology Neutrality”</h4>
            <p>Governments need to find a balance between “technological bias” and “technology neutrality”:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Establishing a Transparent Policy Framework</strong>: Clearly defining the basis and standards for policy implementation to enhance market confidence.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting International Cooperation and Standardization</strong>: Avoiding fragmentation of the technological ecosystem and fostering global technological collaboration.</li>
                <li><strong>Encouraging Technological Innovation and Market Competition</strong>: Supporting small and medium-sized enterprises and startups to prevent market monopolies.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>IV. Conclusion: Balancing and Win-Win in Policy Games</h3>
            <p>Policy games in the cloud computing era involve multiple dimensions, including “computing sovereignty,” “organizational privacy,” and “technological bias.” While governments strive to maintain national security and promote industrial development, they must also seek balance between globalization and localization. By establishing a transparent policy framework, strengthening international cooperation and standardization, and encouraging technological innovation and market competition, an open, inclusive, and secure global digital economy can be built. Only by finding a balance between “computing sovereignty” and “data flow,” as well as “technological bias” and “technology neutrality,” can sustainable development of the digital economy be achieved and a win-win future for the global digital economy be promoted.</p>
