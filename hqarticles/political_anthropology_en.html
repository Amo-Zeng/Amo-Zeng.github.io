            <h2>The Digital Age, Post-Truth, and Ecological Justice: Reconstructing a New Global Political Order</h2>
            <p>In the waves of globalization and technological revolution, the rapid development of digital technology is profoundly reshaping the global political landscape. This transformation not only manifests in the restructuring of power and the changing modes of political participation but also extends to the intersection of environmental protection and social justice. This article delves into identity politics in the digital age, political symbols and rituals in the post-truth era, and the anthropological turn in green politics, aiming to reveal how to construct a more fair, inclusive, and sustainable global political order in the digital age.</p>

            <h3>I. Identity Politics in the Digital Age: The Restructuring of Power Beyond Geographical Boundaries</h3>
            <p>The arrival of the digital age has broken the limits of geographical boundaries on identity, leading to unprecedented complexity and diversity in identity politics. Social media platforms have become new "tribal" spaces where people quickly gather into virtual communities based on shared values, interests, or information preferences. These communities are no longer confined to physical spaces, instead forming close connections that transcend geographical boundaries through data flow and algorithm recommendations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Social Media and Tribal Identity Politics:</strong> The rise of social media has shifted identity politics from traditional labels like nation and ethnicity to "micro-identities" based on shared values.</li>
                <li><strong>Data-Driven Political Manipulation:</strong> Algorithm recommendations, targeted advertising, and data mining have become powerful tools for politicians and political groups to manipulate voter cognition and behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Nomads and Transnational Political Action:</strong> Digital nomads cross both physical and virtual boundaries, forming transnational political alliances and demonstrating strong political mobilization capabilities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Political Symbols and Rituals in the Post-Truth Era: The Rise of Misinformation and Virtual Rituals</h3>
            <p>In the post-truth era, the boundaries between misinformation and facts have become blurred, leading to unprecedented complexity in political symbols and rituals. Misinformation not only serves as a tool for manipulating public opinion but also as a means to challenge official narratives. The rise of meme politics and virtual rituals further changes the ways of political communication and participation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Dual Role of Misinformation:</strong> Misinformation plays a dual role in political rituals, serving both as a tool for manipulating public opinion and as a means to challenge official narratives.</li>
                <li><strong>The Rise of Meme Politics:</strong> Memes, as a new form of political symbol, have stronger spreading and interactive capabilities, breaking the one-way model of traditional political communication.</li>
                <li><strong>Virtual Rituals and Political Participation:</strong> Virtual rituals on online platforms have become a new form of political participation, but they also bring challenges such as the spread of misinformation and extreme speech.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>III. The Anthropological Turn in Green Politics: From Environmental Protection to Ecological Justice</h3>
            <p>With the escalation of global environmental issues and the exacerbation of social inequality, green politics has gradually shifted from simple environmental protection to more complex ecological justice issues. This shift not only redefines the内涵 of green politics but also has a profound impact on its theoretical foundations and practical paths.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>From Environmental Protection to Ecological Justice:</strong> Green politics has increasingly recognized that environmental issues are often caused by social inequality and power imbalances, prompting a shift towards a broader social justice agenda with the rise of ecological justice.</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Refugees and the Global Political Order:</strong> "Climate refugees" caused by climate change are challenging the existing global political order, and green politics has introduced the concept of "environmental citizenship."</li>
                <li><strong>The Integration of Traditional Knowledge and Modern Governance:</strong> Ecological knowledge from indigenous and other traditional societies is increasingly becoming an important theoretical and practical resource for green politics, which has introduced the concept of "pluralistic knowledge systems."</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The convergence of the Digital Age, the Post-Truth era, and Ecological Justice is reshaping the global political landscape. Facing these transformations, we need to adopt a more open and inclusive attitude to rethink the内涵 of democracy, freedom, and human rights, and to construct a fairer and more just digital political order. Only in this way can we seize the initiative in this global transformation and create a better future.</p>
