            <h3>Historical Origin and Universal Values</h3>
            <p><strong>Background and Proposal</strong></p>
            <p>In 1954, at the early stage of the Cold War, the world was divided by the confrontation of two major camps, and the international order was in turmoil. Against this backdrop, China, India, and Burma jointly proposed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This initiative was not only a response to the current international situation but also an exploration of a new order in international relations. Its core goal was to transcend ideological differences and provide a common code of conduct for countries with different social systems and economic development levels, thus pointing the way for global peace and development.</p>
            <p><strong>Manifestation of Universal Values</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mutual Respect for Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity</strong>: National sovereignty is the foundation of international law and international relations. In today’s world, under the trends of globalization and multipolarization, respecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity is the cornerstone of maintaining international peace and stability. All countries should respect the sovereignty of others and avoid intervening in the internal affairs of other countries through force or economic means.</li>
                <li><strong>Mutual Non-Aggression and Non-Interference in Internal Affairs</strong>: These two principles provide a framework for peaceful conflict resolution in the international community. In the face of complex international disputes, countries should resolve problems through dialogue and consultation rather than confrontation, avoiding the use of force or interference in the internal affairs of others, thus laying the foundation for global peace.</li>
                <li><strong>Equality and Mutual Benefit</strong>: In the process of globalization, countries should cooperate on an equal basis to achieve mutual benefit and win-win outcomes. This principle provides important guarantees for building a fair and reasonable international order, especially in global issues such as global trade and climate change, where equal and mutually beneficial cooperation is the key to achieving common development.</li>
                <li><strong>Peaceful Coexistence</strong>: The principle of peaceful coexistence provides a vision for common development in the international community. In the context of increasing global challenges, countries should work together to address issues such as climate change, terrorism, and cybersecurity, based on mutual respect and equality, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Practices and Enlightenments in International Relations</h3>
            <p>The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are not just a theory but also an important guideline widely applied in international relations practice. Through specific cases, we can see the significant value of these principles in resolving international disputes and promoting international cooperation.</p>
            <h4>Peaceful Resolution of the Sino-Indian Border Issue</h4>
            <p>The Sino-Indian border issue is a complex problem with historical roots, and the two countries have at times been in tense confrontation over this issue. However, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, both countries chose dialogue and consultation rather than confrontation. In 1993, China and India signed the "Agreement on Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas," which laid the foundation for a peaceful resolution of the border issue. Subsequently, through multiple high-level dialogues and border negotiations, the two countries gradually eased the border tension, creating a precedent for resolving border issues through peaceful means. This practice demonstrates that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence provide an effective approach to resolving international disputes peacefully.</p>
            <h4>Six-Party Talks on the North Korean Nuclear Issue</h4>
            <p>The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence also played an important role in the North Korean nuclear issue. The participants in the Six-Party Talks included China, North Korea, South Korea, the United States, Russia, and Japan. All parties adhered to the principles of non-interference in internal affairs and equal dialogue, exploring effective ways to resolve the crisis peacefully. Although the talks faced many challenges, this cooperation model demonstrated the unique value of the Five Principles in resolving international disputes. Through dialogue and consultation, all parties worked together to promote the peaceful resolution process of the North Korean nuclear issue.</p>
            <h4>The Belt and Road Initiative</h4>
            <p>China's practice in the Belt and Road Initiative is a vivid interpretation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This initiative adheres to the principles of consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, respects the interests and concerns of countries along the route, and through policy coordination, infrastructure connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration, and people-to-people bonds, promotes the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. Under the Belt and Road framework, China has carried out extensive cooperation with countries along the route, covering infrastructure construction, trade and investment, cultural exchanges, and other fields, achieving mutual benefits and win-win outcomes. This practice shows that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence provide a fair and inclusive cooperation model for international cooperation.</p>

            <h3>Challenges in the Digital Age and Future Development</h3>
            <p>With the advent of the digital age, international relations face new challenges and opportunities. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence need to be continuously developed and innovated in this context.</p>
            <h4>Challenges in the Digital Age</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cybersecurity and Data Sovereignty</strong>: In the digital age, cybersecurity and data sovereignty have become new focal points in international relations. Issues such as cyber attacks and data leaks pose serious threats to national sovereignty and security. Principles such as mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, and non-interference in internal affairs are particularly important in addressing cybersecurity issues. However, existing international rules and mechanisms are still insufficient to cope with these new challenges, and new international rules are urgently needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Divide and Global Governance</strong>: The advent of the digital age has made the global digital divide increasingly prominent. The gap in digital technology development between developed and developing countries has led to inequality in global governance. The principle of equality and mutual benefit in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence has important guiding significance in addressing the digital divide. Countries should cooperate and negotiate on an equal basis to promote fairness and inclusiveness in global digital governance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Future Development</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Building New International Rules</strong>: In the digital age, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence need to be infused with new meanings. Issues such as cybersecurity and data sovereignty urgently require the establishment of new international rules. Countries should cooperate through multilateral channels to formulate unified cybersecurity standards and data protection rules, ensuring common security in the digital age.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting Global Digital Governance</strong>: The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence play an important role in promoting global digital governance. Countries should promote fairness and inclusiveness in global digital governance through cooperation and negotiation on an equal basis. Developed countries should help developing countries enhance their digital technology levels, narrow the digital gap, and achieve common development of the global digital economy.</li>
                <li><strong>Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind</strong>: The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are in line with the concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind. In the digital age, countries should transcend ideological and geopolitical limitations and achieve common development through mutual benefits. Facing global challenges, countries should work together to address new issues such as cybersecurity and data sovereignty, based on mutual respect and equality, and promote the building of a fairer and more reasonable global governance system.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are not only a summary of past experiences but also a guide for future actions. Their universal values, which contain eternal truths, become even more radiant in today’s era of globalization. In the practice of international relations, these principles provide effective ways to resolve disputes peacefully and promote international cooperation. In the digital age, these principles face new challenges but also new development opportunities. By building new international rules, promoting global digital governance, and building a community with a shared future for mankind, their light will surely illuminate the path of human pursuit of peace and development, injecting new momentum into global peace and prosperity.</p>
