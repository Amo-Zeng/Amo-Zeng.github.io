            <h2>From Waterfall to Agile: Shifting Mindsets</h2>
            <p>In the long history of software development, the "Waterfall Model" once dominated. This top-down development approach, much like building a pyramid, was solemn yet slow, with distinct phases—requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, and maintenance—progressing sequentially. Despite its apparent rigor and order, this model harbored hidden risks: high costs for changes in requirements, long communication chains leading to distorted information, and ultimately, products that often diverged significantly from user expectations.</p>
            <p>The emergence of Agile development was a silent revolution. It did not merely seek efficiency improvements but redefined "understanding." Agile Manifesto begins with a clear statement: "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools." This concise declaration reflects a profound reflection on the misalignment of understanding within traditional development models. Agile is not just a work method but a revolution in thinking, teaching us how to seek understanding in uncertainty, evolve through iteration, and ultimately create truly valuable software products.</p>

            <h3>Understanding Users: From Speculation to Dialogue</h3>
            <p>In the Waterfall Model, the requirements analysis phase was akin to a one-way monologue, where development teams tried to guess users' true needs through limited documents and meetings. This understanding based on speculation often missed the mark. The first shot of the Agile revolution was to transform this one-way understanding into continuous dialogue. Through iterative development and user stories, development teams could interact with users continuously, correct misunderstandings in time, and ensure the final product meets user needs.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Understanding Teams: From Division to Collaboration</h3>
            <p>In traditional development models, team members were strictly divided into different roles, with each focusing only on their own tasks, often with superficial understanding of other phases. This clear division, while improving local efficiency, sacrificed overall understanding and collaboration. The Agile revolution emphasizes cross-functional team collaboration, encouraging team members to have a deeper understanding of the project as a whole. Boundaries between roles are broken, and understanding and collaboration become the core driving forces of project advancement.</p>

            <h3>Understanding Process: From Prediction to Adaptation</h3>
            <p>The Waterfall Model was based on prediction, attempting to determine all requirements and solutions at the project's outset. This attempt to control everything often fell short when faced with complex and ever-changing projects. The Agile revolution recognizes that software development is an ongoing process of exploration and adaptation, where understanding lies in the ability to comprehend and respond to changes. Through short-cycle iterations and continuous delivery, Agile teams can maintain understanding and adaptability amidst change, transforming uncertainty into opportunities for innovation.</p>

            <h2>Agile: Dancing in Uncertainty</h2>
            <p>In this era of constant change, "uncertainty" has become one of the most frequently used words to describe our environment. Rapid technological advancements, volatile markets, and unexpected events like pandemics have made "the plan can't keep up with changes" an undeniable fact. How should we respond to such an uncertain world? Agile, originally born in the software development field but now widely applied in various industries, may offer some insights.</p>
            <p>Agile is essentially the art of embracing uncertainty. It acknowledges the complexity and uncertainty of the world and, based on this premise, builds a flexible, continuously iterative system. In the Agile world, plans are no longer "one-time deals" but constantly adjustable "living documents"; goals are not distant "perfect visions" but "minimum viable products" approached through continuous iterations; teams are no longer isolated "islands" but collaborative, growing "Agile tribes."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Respond Quickly to Change</strong>: Agile emphasizes "embracing change" and turning it into a competitive advantage. Under this philosophy, teams can quickly identify environmental changes and adjust strategies and actions to respond to new challenges and opportunities.</li>
                <li><strong>Deliver Value Continuously</strong>: Agile does not pursue "getting it right the first time" but delivers value through continuous small-step iterations, constantly validating assumptions, gathering user feedback, and iterating to improve, ultimately delivering products that meet user needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Build a Learning Organization</strong>: Agile encourages team members to continuously learn, share, reflect, and improve, thereby building an organization capable of adapting to change and continuously growing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Agile: Breaking Chains, Returning to Humanized Software Development</h2>
            <p>For a long time, software development was considered a precise and cold engineering process, where programmers, like factory workers on an assembly line, tapped keyboards day after day, transforming complex business logic into cold code. The traditional Waterfall development model exacerbated this "dehumanization": lengthy requirements analysis, strict phase division, and rigid document-driven processes—all like invisible chains, shackling developers' creativity and passion.</p>
            <p>The emergence of Agile development was like a ray of light, tearing through this gloomy darkness. It advocates putting people at the core, emphasizing iteration, collaboration, and responding to change, transforming software development from a mechanized engineering process into a vibrant creative one.</p>
            <p>Agile development is humanized because it respects humanity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Autonomy</strong>: Agile teams have high autonomy, deciding work methods, task allocation, and priority ranking independently. This gives team members greater responsibility and sense of belonging, stimulating their enthusiasm and creativity.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Agile promotes face-to-face communication and cross-functional teamwork, breaking down departmental barriers and communication obstacles in traditional development models, allowing team members to exchange ideas and solve problems more smoothly.</li>
                <li><strong>Iterative Development</strong>: Agile breaks down the software development process into a series of short-cycle iterations, each delivering usable product increments. This quick feedback mechanism can identify and solve problems promptly, avoiding the high costs of late-stage rework in traditional development models.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Agile development is humanized because it adapts to change.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Embrace Change</strong>: The Agile Manifesto explicitly states, "Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage."</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong>: Agile emphasizes frequent delivery of usable product increments, allowing customers to get timely feedback and value, adjusting requirements and direction based on actual conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Quick Response</strong>: Agile teams have agile organizational structures and efficient communication mechanisms, enabling them to respond quickly to changes and adjust development strategies and resource allocation promptly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Agile development is humanized because it focuses on personal growth.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>: Agile uses retrospective meetings to regularly reflect on and summarize team work methods and processes, continuously optimizing and improving.</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge Sharing</strong>: Agile encourages knowledge and experience sharing among team members, promoting overall team growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Career Development</strong>: Agile provides team members with more learning and growth opportunities, helping them achieve personal and career goals.</li>
            </ul>
