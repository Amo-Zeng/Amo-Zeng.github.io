            <h2>The Evolution of Negotiable Certificates of Deposit: From Liquidity Tools to Diverse Paths in Capital Management</h2>
            <p>Since its introduction in China in 1986, Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (NCDs) have long been regarded as a powerful tool for commercial banks' liquidity management. However, with the deepening of financial market reforms and the transformation of banking business models in China, the role of NCDs is undergoing profound changes. From the initial tool for liquidity management, to a hedging instrument for interest rate risk, and then to a capital supplement tool for small and medium-sized banks, the functions of NCDs have gradually diversified and become an important tool for banks' asset-liability management and risk control. This transformation not only reflects the development trend of the financial market but also provides banks with more flexible and diversified capital management paths.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>1. The Traditional Role of Liquidity Management Tools</h3>
            <p>Under the traditional banking framework, NCDs were primarily used to adjust short-term capital positions and meet the daily liquidity needs of banks. Banks could quickly raise funds by issuing NCDs to fill short-term liquidity gaps, or invest surplus funds in NCDs during periods of ample liquidity to earn returns. In this model, the issuance and trading of NCDs were mainly based on short-term capital supply and demand, and the impact of interest rate fluctuations on banks was relatively limited. For example, large commercial banks would issue short-term NCDs with 1-month or 3-month maturities to flexibly adjust capital surpluses and deficits, maintaining a balance in the balance sheet.</p>
            <p>However, with the advancement of interest rate liberalization and the increasing complexity of the financial market, the traditional functions of NCDs gradually revealed their limitations. Short-term NCDs were hard-pressed to meet banks' long-term capital management needs, and banks struggled to cope with interest rate fluctuations and asset-liability maturity mismatches.</p>

            <h3>2. The New Role of Interest Rate Risk Hedging Tools</h3>
            <p>As China's interest rate liberalization reform deepens, the interest rate risk faced by banks has become increasingly prominent. Interest rate fluctuations not only affect banks' net interest margins but can also lead to asset-liability maturity mismatches, posing significant market risks. In this context, NCDs, as tools for market-based pricing, have gradually gained importance for their role in hedging interest rate risks.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Locking Future Financing Costs</strong>: Banks can lock in future financing costs by issuing long-term NCDs, avoiding the pressure of rising funding costs due to interest rate hikes. For instance, when banks anticipate future interest rate increases, they can issue fixed-rate long-term NCDs in advance to lock in funds at the current lower interest rate, thereby reducing future financing costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Hedging Asset-Liability Interest Rate Risks</strong>: Banks can use NCDs to hedge the maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities. For example, when a bank holds a large amount of floating-rate loans, it can issue fixed-rate NCDs to hedge the risk of declining asset returns due to future market interest rate increases. Conversely, when a bank holds a large amount of fixed-rate bonds, it can issue floating-rate NCDs to hedge the risk of rising liability costs due to market interest rate declines.</li>
                <li><strong>Constructing Interest Rate Derivative Trading Strategies</strong>: NCDs can also serve as the basis for constructing interest rate derivative trading strategies. Banks can combine NCDs with other interest rate derivatives (such as interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, etc.) to create more complex hedging strategies, thereby managing interest rate risks more precisely.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>3. The Expansion as a Capital Supplement Tool for Small and Medium-sized Banks</h3>
            <p>In addition to their application in interest rate risk management, NCDs have gradually become an important tool for small and medium-sized banks to supplement capital. For a long time, the issuers of NCDs were mainly large commercial banks with adequate capital and high credit ratings, while small and medium-sized banks, due to lower credit ratings and limited financing channels, were unable to participate significantly in the NCD market. However, with the continuous improvement of financial regulatory policies and the evolution of market environments, the role of NCDs in capital supplementation for small and medium-sized banks has become increasingly prominent.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Policy Support and Market Demand</strong>: Regulatory authorities encourage small and medium-sized banks to supplement capital through various channels, and NCDs, as a tool with a high degree of marketization, have received policy support. Meanwhile, with the development of the financial market, investor demand for NCDs has become increasingly diversified, and the market space for small and medium-sized banks to issue NCDs has been continuously expanding.</li>
                <li><strong>Tool Innovation and Improved Financing Efficiency</strong>: Small and medium-sized banks actively explore innovative models of NCDs, such as issuing callable, convertible, and other new types of NCDs, to meet the needs of different investors and improve financing efficiency. These innovative tools not only provide more flexible financing options for small and medium-sized banks but also offer financial support for the development of the real economy.</li>
                <li><strong>Significance in Supporting the Real Economy</strong>: By issuing NCDs, small and medium-sized banks can effectively supplement capital, improve capital adequacy ratios, and enhance risk resistance. Well-capitalized small and medium-sized banks can better support the development of small and micro enterprises, private enterprises, and other sectors of the real economy, promoting economic transformation and upgrading. For example, some small and medium-sized banks have issued long-term NCDs to provide stable financial support for local enterprises, driving sustainable regional economic development.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>4. The Inevitable Trend of Maturity Structure Optimization</h3>
            <p>Another important direction of evolution for NCDs is the optimization of their maturity structure. For a long time, NCDs have been dominated by short-term maturities, with 1-month and 3-month NCDs occupying a leading position in the market. However, with the development of the financial market and the transformation and upgrading of banking business, the single short-term maturity structure can no longer meet market demands.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Diversified Market Demand</strong>: Investors' preferences for the maturity of financial products have become increasingly diversified, requiring both short-term products to meet liquidity needs and long-term products for asset allocation to obtain higher returns. As major participants in the financial market, banks need more flexible liability management tools to match different maturity needs on the asset side, reduce maturity mismatch risks, and improve risk management levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Gradual Relaxation of Policy Environment</strong>: In recent years, regulatory authorities have gradually relaxed restrictions on the maturity of NCDs, creating favorable conditions for the development of long-term NCDs. For example, some banks have started to issue 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, and even longer-term NCDs to meet the diverse maturity needs of the market.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultivation of Long-term Capital Markets</strong>: To promote the optimization of the maturity structure of NCDs, the market needs to cultivate more long-term capital sources. Institutional investors such as insurance companies and fund companies have gradually become important holders of NCDs, providing stable funding support for the development of long-term NCDs.</li>
            </ol>

        <section>
            <h3>5. Challenges and Outlook</h3>
            <p>Although NCDs have made significant progress in functional diversification and maturity structure optimization, their development still faces some challenges:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Need for Improved Marketization</strong>: The NCD market still faces issues such as pricing distortions and insufficient liquidity, affecting its hedging effects and capital supplement functions.</li>
                <li><strong>Need for Enhanced Risk Management Capabilities</strong>: Whether for interest rate risk hedging or capital supplementation, banks need to establish sound risk management systems to effectively utilize NCDs for risk management.</li>
                <li><strong>Need for Improved Regulatory Policies</strong>: Regulatory authorities need to further refine relevant policies and regulations, balancing financial innovation and risk prevention to ensure the healthy development of the NCD market.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Looking ahead, as interest rate liberalization reform continues to advance and the demand for financial market risk management grows, NCDs are expected to play an even more important role in bank asset-liability management and risk control. Meanwhile, small and medium-sized banks' use of NCDs for capital supplementation will also inject new vitality into the development of the real economy. In the future, the maturity structure of NCDs will become more diversified, and their functions will become richer, providing stronger support for the stable operation of the banking industry and the sustainable development of the real economy.</p>
