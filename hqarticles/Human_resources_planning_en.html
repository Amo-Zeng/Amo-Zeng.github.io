            <p>In the wave of digital transformation and global competition, traditional human resource management models are facing profound challenges. Enterprises need to accurately predict talent demands in a rapidly changing market environment while building an open and flexible talent ecosystem to achieve sustainable growth. This article explores how to reshape modern enterprise human resource planning through a comprehensive perspective of data-driven, ecosystem-based, and technology-enabled approaches.</p>

            <h3>1. Data-Driven: From Empiricism to Scientific Decision-Making</h3>
            <p>Traditional talent management heavily relies on the experience and intuition of managers. However, in complex business environments, this model has become inadequate. Enterprises need to view talent as "data sets," achieving scientific and precise human resource planning through quantitative analysis and predictive technologies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Building a Talent Data Warehouse:</strong> From performance and skills to career development trajectories, enterprises need to integrate multidimensional data to form a comprehensive talent profile.</li>
                <li><strong>Applying Data Analysis Models:</strong> Such as cluster analysis, regression analysis, and correlation analysis, helping enterprises discover the best match between talent and positions.</li>
                <li><strong>Predicting Future Supply and Demand Gaps:</strong> By analyzing industry trends and enterprise strategies, predict future skill demands and job vacancies.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>2. Ecosystem-Based Talent Management: Breaking Boundaries, Building an Open System</h3>
            <p>In the context of digitalization and globalization, enterprises' talent needs are increasingly diverse. Ecosystem-based talent management provides a solution to this challenge.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Breaking Organizational Boundaries:</strong> By collaborating with external platforms, universities, and research institutions, build an open talent ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Establishing Talent Sharing Platforms:</strong> Promote internal cross-departmental talent mobility to improve resource utilization.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible Employment Models:</strong> Hire temporary or part-time talent through external platforms to quickly meet peak talent demands.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>3. Dual Empowerment of Technology and Culture: From Competition to Symbiosis</h3>
            <p>Technology and culture play a dual role in talent management, driving enterprises from competition to symbiosis.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Big Data:</strong> Through intelligent algorithms and data analysis, accurately predict and match talent demands.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized Management and Empowerment:</strong> Stimulate individual potential, providing personalized development plans and growth platforms for employees.</li>
                <li><strong>Building Agile Organizations:</strong> Enhance organizational agility and innovation through data insights and flexible talent resource allocation.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>4. Future Outlook: The Continuous Evolution of Talent Management</h3>
            <p>In the future, enterprises will increasingly rely on artificial intelligence and big data to achieve intelligent talent matching and dynamic management while focusing on cultural transformation and social responsibility to drive sustainable development.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Driven by the dual trends of digitalization and ecosystemization, enterprise talent management is undergoing a profound revolution. Through data-driven scientific decision-making, open ecosystem-based systems, and the dual empowerment of technology and culture, enterprises can achieve a transformation from competition to symbiosis, building a sustainable talent ecosystem that provides solid support for future development.</p>
