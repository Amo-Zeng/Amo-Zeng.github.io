Your question about "数甲" (Shu Jia) typically refers to the following scenarios. Please clarify based on your background:

---

### **1. Abbreviated Course Names in Some Mainland China Schools**  
**High School Math Exam/Course (Advanced Level)**  
In some regions (e.g., Shanghai), high school science-track math courses may be divided into "Math A" (数甲) and "Math B" (数乙):  
- **Math A (数甲)**: More advanced content and higher difficulty, usually for top science students or competition-oriented learners.  
- **Core Topics**: Calculus, spatial analytic geometry, advanced algebra, in-depth probability and statistics.  
- **Exam Prep Tips**: Focus on high-difficulty problems (e.g., composite functions and derivatives, complex sequence proofs).

### **2. College Entrance Exam Subject in Taiwan, China**  
**GSAT (学测) or Advanced Subject Test**  
In Taiwan, high school math is categorized as:  
- **Math A (数甲)**: Required for science/engineering/medical majors, covering:  
  - Calculus (limits, differentiation, integral applications)  
  - Spatial vectors and plane equations  
  - Probability and statistics (e.g., hypothesis testing)  
  - Matrices and linear transformations  
  ▶ **Key Exam Topics**: Frequent questions include integral area/volume calculations, exponential/logarithmic modeling.

### **3. University Math Course Codes in Mainland China**  
Some universities use "A"/"B" to denote math difficulty levels:  
| Level | Target Students | Typical Textbook |  
|-------|-----------------|------------------|  
| Advanced Math A | Physics, Engineering | *Mathematical Analysis* + *Advanced Algebra* |  
| Advanced Math B | Economics, Biology | Simplified *Calculus* |  

For exam prep, practice problems from **"Demidovich Problem Book"** (e.g., curve integrals, series).

### **Targeted Preparation Advice**  
Specify your needs:  
1. **High School Math A** (competition/advanced) → Request high-difficulty function/derivative problem sets.  
2. **Taiwan GSAT Math A** → Ask for recent exam question analysis.  
3. **University Math A** → Seek crash courses in linear algebra/mathematical analysis.
