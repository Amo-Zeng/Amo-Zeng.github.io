            <h2>Multidimensional Construction of Modernity: From Digital Viruses to Plant Intelligence</h2>
            <p>In exploring modernity, we often view it as a result of physical world changes since the Industrial Revolution. However, with the intertwined development of digital technology and ecological crisis, modernity has transcended traditional geographic and material limits, becoming a new form of modernity that spreads like a “digital virus” in cyberspace. This new modernity not only reshapes individual identity but also profoundly affects social relationships and political order. Meanwhile, the proposal of “plant intelligence” overturns our traditional understanding of the plant world, revealing the integrity and wisdom of ecosystems, and calling for new paths to explore harmonious coexistence between humans and nature. The discussion of emotional labor and body politics reveals the process of gender division of labor and social order construction in modern society, reflecting on the regulation of individual emotions and bodies by modernity. This article will explore the multiple constructions of modernity and their profound impacts from these three dimensions.</p>

            <h3>Digital Viruses and Cyberspace: Transformation of Cognition and Behavior</h3>
            <p>The metaphor of “digital virus” aptly describes how digital technology spreads like a virus in human society, subtly changing our cognitive and behavioral patterns. The internet and social media platforms are not merely tools for information dissemination but also reconstructors of cognitive frameworks. Through algorithmic recommendations, personalized content, and instant feedback, these platforms continuously reinforce users’ specific viewpoints and behavioral habits, creating a “filter bubble” effect that makes people more likely to fall into information cocoons.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Transformation:</strong> Digital experiences facilitate the production and dissemination of information and knowledge, but also bring problems of information overload and the proliferation of false information.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Impact:</strong> The “like” and “share” mechanisms on social media encourage short-sighted and emotional public discussions rather than deep and rational thinking.</li>
                <li><strong>Identity Fluidity:</strong> Individual identities in cyberspace are no longer single and fixed but multiple and fluid.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Plant Intelligence and Ecological Politics: Challenging Traditional Perceptions and Building New Paths</h3>
            <p>The concept of “plant intelligence” overturns our traditional understanding of the plant world. Plants are not merely living organisms but intelligent beings with complex perception and coping abilities. Plants can communicate through chemical signals, sense environmental changes, and make corresponding adaptive adjustments. This intelligence is not only reflected in individual survival strategies but also in the coordinated operations of the entire ecosystem.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Ecosystem Integrity:</strong> The interactions between plants, and between plants and the environment, form a complex network.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Civilization Construction:</strong> Research on plant intelligence provides new perspectives to help us understand the complexity and wisdom of natural systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Green Politics:</strong> Research on plant intelligence provides new theoretical support for green politics, revealing the important role of plants in ecosystems.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Emotional Labor and Body Politics: Construction of Gender Division of Labor and Social Order in Modern Society</h3>
            <p>In exploring the construction of modern society, we often tend to view it as the product of rational order, but this perspective overlooks the crucial role of emotional labor in the formation of modernity. With the rise of the service industry, emotional labor not only becomes an important mode of production but also a core force shaping gender division of labor, intimate relationships, and social order in modern society. This article will explore from the perspective of “body politics” how the production, distribution, and consumption of emotional labor affect gender division of labor in modern society, reflecting on the regulation of individual emotions and bodies by modernity, and exploring paths toward gender equality and social justice.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Production of Emotional Labor:</strong> Emotional labor refers to the behavior of individuals displaying, managing, and regulating emotions to meet the needs of others.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact of Body Politics:</strong> Women’s bodies often become the primary carriers of emotional labor, constrained by social norms and cultural expectations.</li>
                <li><strong>Gender Division of Labor and Social Order:</strong> The production, distribution, and consumption of emotional labor not only shape gender division of labor in modern society but also influence the construction of social order.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Conclusion: Multidimensional Construction of Modernity and Future Prospects</h3>
            <p>Digital technology, like a “digital virus,” spreads rapidly in cyberspace, reshaping multiple dimensions of modernity. It not only changes our cognition and behavior but also creates new social structures and cultural forms. This new modernity transcends geographic boundaries, deconstructs traditional authority, but also brings a series of new challenges. Meanwhile, the proposal of “plant intelligence” overturns our traditional understanding of the plant world, revealing the integrity and wisdom of ecosystems, calling for new paths to explore harmonious coexistence between humans and nature. The discussion of emotional labor and body politics reveals the process of gender division of labor and social order construction in modern society, reflecting on the regulation of individual emotions and bodies by modernity.</p>
            <p>While enjoying the convenience and innovation brought by digital technology, we also need to be vigilant about its potential risks and negative impacts, striving to build a more inclusive and secure digital future. By re-examining the production, distribution, and consumption of emotional labor, we can explore paths toward gender equality and social justice. Research on plant intelligence provides new perspectives to help us understand the complexity and wisdom of natural systems, exploring new paths for harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.</p>
