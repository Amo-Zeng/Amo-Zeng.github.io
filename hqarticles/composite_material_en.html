            <h2>Sustainability and Environmental Friendliness of Composites</h2>
            <p>The sustainability and environmental friendliness of composites have become crucial topics in the industry. Bio-based composites, made from renewable resources like plant fibers and bio-plastics, significantly reduce carbon emissions and mitigate long-term environmental impacts due to their excellent degradability. Furthermore, the implementation of circular economy principles, such as designing recyclable or biodegradable composites, further promotes efficient resource utilization and lowers environmental pollution. By optimizing production processes, enhancing product durability, and establishing efficient recycling systems, the composites industry is steadily advancing its sustainability goals.</p>

            <h2>Innovative Applications of Composites in Aerospace</h2>
            <p>In the aerospace sector, composites, particularly carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) and glass fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP), have become central to the design and manufacturing of next-generation aircraft and satellites. These materials significantly lighten the weight of aircraft and satellites, improve fuel efficiency, and extend the service life of aircraft through their exceptional corrosion and fatigue resistance. The application of ceramic matrix composites (CMC) in spacecraft thermal protection systems highlights their critical role in maintaining structural integrity and thermal insulation in extreme environments.</p>
