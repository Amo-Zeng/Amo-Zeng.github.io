            <h2>The Wisdom of Nature: Insights from Biomaterials</h2>
            <p>Biomaterials are the products of billions of years of evolution in nature, often combining high strength, lightweight, and multifunctionality. For example, spider silk is five times stronger than steel but much lighter; the nacre of seashells, composed of calcium carbonate layers and organic matrix, has far greater toughness and impact resistance than pure minerals. These unique properties have inspired scientists to design new composite materials by mimicking biological structures.</p>
            <p>Biomimicry, as an interdisciplinary field, focuses on imitating natural mechanisms to solve human problems. By observing and analyzing the structures, functions, and material properties of organisms, scientists can extract universal design principles and apply them to material science. For instance, composite materials mimicking honeycomb structures exhibit high compressive strength and lightweight properties, widely used in aerospace; materials replicating the microstructure of lotus leaves have superhydrophobic properties, suitable for self-cleaning surfaces.</p>
