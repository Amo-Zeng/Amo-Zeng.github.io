            <h2>Aristotelian Philosophy in the Contemporary: The Intersection of Ethics, Digital Technology, and Global Governance</h2>
            <p>Aristotle's philosophical system, as a cornerstone of Western thought, has left a profound impact not only in the fields of ethics and political science but has also shown new vitality in the context of modern technology and globalization. This article aims to delve into how Aristotle's ethical principles blend with modern well-being science, analyze the innovative application of his concepts of form and matter in the digital age, and examine the guiding role of his political theories in addressing new challenges in global governance. Through this interdisciplinary perspective, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the far-reaching influence and practical applications of Aristotelian philosophy in contemporary society.</p>

            <h3>The Integration of Aristotle's Ethics and Modern Well-Being Science</h3>
            <p>Aristotle's ethics emphasize eudaimonia as the highest goal of life, advocating for its achievement through the practice of virtues and the pursuit of a balanced mean. Modern well-being science focuses on positive emotions, life satisfaction, engagement, meaning, and relationships. The integration of the two provides a robust framework to help individuals seek more lasting well-being in modern society. For instance, individuals can enhance positive emotions and life meaning by cultivating virtues and practicing wisdom, which is particularly crucial in today's fast-paced life.</p>

            <h3>The Application of Form and Matter in Digital Technology</h3>
            <p>In the realm of digital technology, Aristotle's concepts of form and matter are given new interpretations. Software code, as form, defines the functionality and intrinsic logic of digital products, while hardware devices, as matter, provide the physical platform for operation. This distinction not only reveals the interaction between design and function in digital products but also emphasizes the importance of the dynamic balance between form and matter. With technological advancements, this balance helps drive innovation in digital products and optimize user experience.</p>

            <h3>Political Theory in Addressing New Challenges of Global Governance</h3>
            <p>Aristotle's political theory provides a robust framework for understanding new challenges in global governance. In the context of globalization, traditional national borders and political forms are being challenged, requiring international cooperation, multiculturalism, and the construction of multi-level governance systems. Aristotle's concept of a republic, emphasizing the common good and public interest, can be extended to the international level, promoting an inclusive international order and multicultural justice. Additionally, multi-level governance systems offer effective organizational structures to address global challenges such as climate change and cybersecurity.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Aristotle's philosophical system not only maintains its theoretical depth and breadth in contemporary society but also demonstrates its adaptability and practical value through its integration with modern science, technology, and global governance. By deeply analyzing its ethical principles, the distinction between form and matter, and the application of political theory in global governance, we can better understand and address the complex challenges of contemporary society, promoting a more virtuous, harmonious, and happy society. This interdisciplinary perspective not only renews the practical significance of Aristotelian philosophy but also provides rich resources for philosophical reflection in modern society.</p>
