            <h2>Exploring New Perspectives on Galaxy Cluster Classification: The Integrated Application of Multi-wavelength Observations, Machine Learning, and Cosmological Simulations</h2>
            <p>Galaxy clusters, as the largest known structures in the universe, are crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of the cosmos. Traditional classification of galaxy clusters has primarily relied on single-wavelength observational data, such as optical wavelengths, but this approach has limitations in understanding the structure and dynamics of galaxy clusters in depth. With the leap in astronomical technology, the integrated application of multi-wavelength observations, machine learning, and cosmological simulations has brought revolutionary progress to the study of galaxy cluster classification. These new methods not only enhance the accuracy and efficiency of classification but also deepen our understanding of the physical characteristics of galaxy clusters.</p>

            <h3>Multi-wavelength Observations and Multi-parameter Analysis</h3>
            <p>Multi-wavelength observations provide different perspectives of information, aiding in a comprehensive understanding of galaxy cluster properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>X-ray Observations:</strong> Through X-ray telescopes like Chandra, we can detect the distribution of hot gas within galaxy clusters, understanding their temperature, density, and dynamic structure. X-ray data reveal the shape and temperature variations of gas clouds in galaxy clusters, providing key information about their formation and evolution.</li>
                <li><strong>Radio Band Observations:</strong> Radio telescopes like VLA and LOFAR can capture the activity of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and high-energy particles, revealing energy release processes and magnetic field structures within galaxy clusters.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrared Observations:</strong> Infrared observations through telescopes like Spitzer and Herschel help us delve into star formation activities and dust distribution within galaxy clusters. This data is crucial for understanding the star formation history and dust obscuration effects within clusters.</li>
