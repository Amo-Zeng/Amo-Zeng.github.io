        <section>
            <h2>Nuclear Energy Development and AI Ethics: Balancing Technology and Values</h2>
            <p>Nuclear power plants provide clean energy, but their safe operation, waste disposal, and intelligent management increasingly rely on AI systems. This technological integration brings efficiency improvements while simultaneously raising new ethical challenges around control rights, data sovereignty, and the distribution of environmental risks.</p>

        <!-- Ethics Impact Section -->
        <section>
            <h3>Ethical Risks of Nuclear Energy Intelligence</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Safety Control Risks:</strong> AI autonomous decision-making systems might contain algorithmic vulnerabilities, leading to the failure of safety mechanisms (e.g., the cooling system failure risk exposed during the Fukushima nuclear disaster)</li>
                <li><strong>Decision-making Black Box:</strong> Deep learning-driven reactor control systems lack interpretability, hindering effective human intervention and judgment</li>
                <li><strong>Data Sovereignty Debates:</strong> Cross-border AI operations platforms may access sensitive operational data, raising concerns regarding national sovereignty over nuclear technologies</li>
                <li><strong>Intergenerational Equity Challenges:</strong> Nuclear waste disposal schemes optimized by AI face uncertainties in risk forecasting across millennia, raising questions of intergenerational ethical responsibility</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Response Strategies Section -->
        <section>
            <h3>AI Ethics Governance Framework for Nuclear Energy</h3>
            <p>A governance system with four dimensions should be established:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Technical Redundancy Design:</strong> Implement human-machine collaborative dual-channel control systems with manual confirmation retained for crucial decisions</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithm Auditing Mechanism:</strong> Develop nuclear-specific explainable AI (XAI) models to ensure that all autonomous decision paths are traceable</li>
                <li><strong>Data Sovereignty Protocols:</strong> Establish an international nuclear data governance alliance and define tiered authorization standards for cross-border data transfers</li>
                <li><strong>Intergenerational Responsibility Insurance:</strong> Create a blockchain-based nuclear waste responsibility fund with AI-generated predictions activating automatic insurance compensation</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <!-- Policy and Regulation Section -->
        <section>
            <h3>Innovations in Global Nuclear Regulation</h3>
            <p>Examples of regulatory innovations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>IAEA’s new <em>AI Application Guidelines</em> require quantum computing simulation of extreme scenarios for AI systems in all new nuclear power stations</li>
                <li>The EU’s <em>Artificial Intelligence Act</em> categorizes nuclear AI systems as high-risk, requiring mandatory ongoing ethical algorithmic assessments</li>
                <li>China National Nuclear Corporation has established an “AI Safety Officer” system, granting system-level ethical review veto power</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <section>
            <h3>Building a Co-evolutionary System</h3>
            <p>The deep integration of nuclear energy and AI requires a "technology-ethics-institution" triple helix model: Fully utilize AI to enhance nuclear safety while preventing technological out-of-control risks via dynamic ethical frameworks, in order to achieve a harmonious unification of sustainable clean energy goals and technological ethical principles.</p>
