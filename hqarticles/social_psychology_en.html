            <h2>Introduction: How We Make Decisions in the Digital World</h2>
            <p>With the development of social media and artificial intelligence, the information we encounter daily is filtered by algorithms. This filtering not only shapes our cognition but also influences our judgments and behaviors. Are algorithms subtly reshaping our value systems?</p>

            <h3>The Invisible Manipulation of Algorithms: Information Bubbles and Recommendation Mechanisms</h3>
            <p>Under the guise of "personalized recommendations," algorithms continuously push information that aligns with our interests and viewpoints, gradually forming information bubbles. People who remain in these bubbles for extended periods become increasingly extreme, lack diverse perspectives, and even lose critical thinking skills.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information Asymmetry:</strong> Individuals' understanding of events becomes increasingly based on one-sided content filtered by algorithms.</li>
                <li><strong>Group Polarization:</strong> Groups with similar views are connected by algorithms, exacerbating social divisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Decision Bias:</strong> Our choices are increasingly constrained by algorithmic predictions rather than independent judgment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Crisis of Empathy: Weakening Interpersonal Relationships in the Virtual World</h3>
            <p>In the digital environment, people are increasingly accustomed to communicating through screens, reducing face-to-face interactions and loosening emotional connections. This change weakens our empathy, thereby affecting social trust and cooperation.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Weakened Emotional Expression:</strong> Emojis and brief texts replace complex and genuine emotional expressions.</li>
                <li><strong>Diffusion of Responsibility:</strong> It becomes easier to remain passive in the face of injustice or malicious behavior online.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Dependence on Platforms:</strong> Human emotional needs are filled by algorithmically provided "pseudo-interpersonal relationships."</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The Shaking of Beliefs: Are Beliefs Still Shaped by Humans?</h3>
            <p>From news to advertisements, from social content to search rankings, are our beliefs being shaped by platforms? So-called "objective information" is "optimized" by algorithms, indirectly influencing and even reconstructing people's beliefs and values.</p>
            <p>In the face of this trend, we need to develop stronger digital literacy to discern and reflect on the information we receive and maintain our judgment.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion: How to Address Cognitive Dilemmas in the Digital Age</h3>
            <p>We need to address this issue from technological, institutional, and cultural perspectives, establishing more transparent platform mechanisms, enhancing users' control over information, and rebuilding a genuine and sustainable system of human cognition and communication in the digital age.</p>
