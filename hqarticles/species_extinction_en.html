The term "数甲" (Shu Jia) can refer to concepts in different fields, and its specific meaning depends on the context. Below are several possible interpretations:

---

### 1. **Mathematics Competition (Mainland China)**
   - In the **National High School Mathematics League (referred to as "高联" or Gao Lian)**, the full score for the **first round** is called "数甲." Typically, the competition is divided into the **first round** and the **second round**:
     - **First Round**: The full score is 120 points, covering all high school mathematics topics (including complex numbers, probability, solid geometry, etc.).
     - **Second Round**: The full score is 180 points, focusing on four major modules (algebra, geometry, number theory, and combinatorics).
   - Top performers may advance to the **provincial team** and represent their province in the **Chinese Mathematical Olympiad (CMO)**.

### 2. **Ancient Chinese Mathematics Texts**
   - In the **《数书九章》 (Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections)** written by Qin Jiushao in the Song Dynasty, the text might be divided into volumes labeled "甲 (Jia), 乙 (Yi), 丙 (Bing)," etc., but "数甲" is not a standard term.
   - Ancient imperial examination subjects (such as mathematics) might also use "甲, 乙" to denote different grades, but this requires specific historical documentation for verification.

### 3. **Other Possibilities**
   - **University Courses**: Some universities might use "数学甲" (Shu Xue Jia) or "数学乙" (Shu Xue Yi) to differentiate the difficulty levels of mathematics courses (e.g., a similar system was used in Taiwan).
   - **Abbreviations or Slang**: Specific groups or regions might use "数甲" as colloquial slang for mathematics exams.
