            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In an era of rapid technological advancement, the inheritance of intangible cultural heritage (hereinafter referred to as "cultural heritage") faces unprecedented opportunities and challenges. The application of digital technology not only provides new possibilities for the protection and inheritance of cultural heritage but also infuses new vitality into it. At the same time, the rise of social enterprise models offers a new pathway for the sustainable development of cultural heritage. By combining digitalization with social enterprise models, we can not only better protect and inherit cultural heritage but also endow it with new meanings and vitality in the context of globalization.</p>

            <h3>The Role of Digitalization in Cultural Heritage</h3>
            <p>Digitalization has become an indispensable tool in the modern preservation of cultural heritage. Through digital archiving, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR), cultural heritage can be preserved and presented in ways that were previously unimaginable. This not only ensures the authenticity and completeness of the heritage but also makes it accessible to a wider audience, transcending geographical and temporal limitations.</p>
