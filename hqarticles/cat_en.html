            <p>In the digital transformation of content production, website creators often face a dilemma: rely on AI to write content and gain speed but lose authenticity; or write everything manually and preserve truth, but struggle with scalability. This binary opposition between "AI as a writer" and "human as the sole author" stems from a misalignment in cognitive division of labor. We urgently need to move beyond viewing AI merely as a tool or a replacement, and instead redefine it as <strong>cognitive scaffolding</strong>—a collaborative system that supports higher-order human thinking and expands the boundaries of cognition.</p>

            <h3>Cognitive Scaffolding: From Tool to Support</h3>
            <p>The theory of "cognitive scaffolding" emphasizes that external support—through structured information and reduced cognitive load—enables humans to focus on abstract reasoning and meaning construction. AI's strength does not lie in "expression," but in "organization": it excels at <strong>logical structuring, information aggregation, and first-draft generation</strong>, which are precisely the core functions of an ideal cognitive scaffold. In contrast, human strengths lie in <strong>value judgment, narrative leaps, and emotional infusion</strong>—the deep cognitive activities that give content its soul. The layered model of human-AI co-creation is precisely a redesign based on this division of cognitive labor.</p>

            <h3>The Three-Layer Model of Human-AI Co-Creation</h3>
            <ol class="three-layer-model">
                <li>
                    <strong>Layer 1: AI Builds the Cognitive Foundation</strong>
                    <p>AI handles information integration and structural pre-construction. For example, when writing an article titled <em>"Mental Health Challenges in Remote Work"</em>, AI can rapidly synthesize research literature, generate a three-part framework of "stressors—intervention mechanisms—organizational responsibility," and automatically embed data from the WHO, employee survey samples, and psychological theories. At this stage, AI performs "cognitive offloading," freeing the creator from building the logical framework from scratch.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Layer 2: Humans Lead Value Calibration</strong>
                    <p>Humans intervene to perform <strong>cognitive leaps</strong>. While AI might prioritize "improving work efficiency," humans identify deeper issues such as "loneliness," "identity ambiguity," and "anxiety from digital surveillance," thereby reweighting the information. For instance, replacing AI's suggestion of "frequency of video meetings" with "suppression of self-expression in asynchronous communication," and introducing philosopher Byung-Chul Han's concept of the "burnout society," transforming the piece from descriptive analysis into critical insight.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Layer 3: Human-AI Collaborative Narrative Elevation</strong>
                    <p>AI provides language refinement, stylistic adaptation, and pacing suggestions, while humans lead emotional storytelling. For example, AI might suggest rewriting "employees feel lonely" as "digital nomads are experiencing existential alienation." Humans then add personal narratives: "A programmer, after three months without meeting colleagues, began to question whether he truly existed." AI then adjusts paragraph length and rhetorical density based on the emotional arc, resulting in a text that combines a "rational skeleton" with an "emotional texture."</p>

            <h3>Practical Case: <em>"The Attention Crisis in the Age of Short Videos"</em></h3>
            <p>A cultural commentary site produced an article titled <em>"The Attention Crisis in the Age of Short Videos."</em> Within 30 minutes, AI generated a first draft with 20 arguments and 50 data points—structurally sound but superficial. The editorial team spent 2 hours on value calibration, focusing on three core dimensions: "commodification of attention," "fragmentation of cognition," and "shallowness of memory," while eliminating technical details like "platform algorithms." They then spent 1 hour infusing a humanistic perspective, citing Walter Benjamin's "the decay of aura" and Neil Postman's "amusing ourselves to death," and concluded with the question: "When attention becomes the scarcest resource, are we collectively losing our capacity for contemplation?" The final piece reached over 100,000 views, with AI contributing approximately 45% (structure + first draft) and humans 55% (value + narrative). <strong>Efficiency improved by 2.8x, and comment depth increased by 3x.</strong></p>

            <h3>Layered Authorship: Redefining the Human-AI Relationship</h3>
            <p>The key to this model lies in <strong>layered authorship</strong>: AI must not overstep into value judgment, and humans must not waste effort on low-level tasks. AI is "cognitive scaffolding," not a "substitute for thought." Creators should become "cognitive architects"—injecting human judgment, philosophical inquiry, and emotional warmth into the skeleton built by AI.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Let AI Lay the Foundation, Let Humans Build the Soul</h3>
            <p>The essence of future content competition will no longer be "speed" or "truth," but "depth of collaboration." <strong>Let AI lay the foundation, let humans build the soul.</strong> Only in this way can we continue to produce content with intellectual weight—even in the age of efficiency.</p>
