            <h2>Introduction: The Paradigm Crisis and Reconstruction of Leadership</h2>
            <p>
                As algorithms begin to participate in strategic decision-making, as Gen Z prioritizes "meaning" over "salary," and as remote collaboration blurs organizational boundaries—traditional "command-and-control" leadership has become a rusty gear, unable to drive the massive machinery of digital-era organizations. This is not merely an efficiency issue, but a <span class="highlight">paradigm crisis</span>: the old power structures, cognitive models, and value logic are being dismantled by the triple forces of technology, humanity, and social change.
            </p>
            <p>
                This article proposes the <span class="highlight">Triple Leap of Contemporary Leadership</span>: <b>rebalancing cognitive sovereignty between humans and machines, constructing systemic psychological resilience, and co-creating an organizational meaning ecosystem</b>. This is not just a role shift, but a <span class="highlight">deep reconstruction of the leadership paradigm</span>: from "I lead" to "we co-construct," from "managing performance" to "activating meaning," and from "controlling people" to "empowering people."
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Leap One: Rebalancing Cognitive Sovereignty – From Cognitive Co-Governance to Cognitive Symbiosis</h2>
            <p>
                Algorithms are not tools—they are <span class="highlight">cognitive collaborators</span>. When AI can predict customer behavior and generate strategic plans, if leaders still cling to the myth of "omniscient authority," they only intensify human-machine conflict. The real challenge lies in <span class="highlight">redefining "who holds decision-making power"</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We propose "<b>Rebalancing Cognitive Sovereignty between Humans and Machines</b>"—not mere division of labor, but establishing a <span class="highlight">dynamic sovereignty allocation mechanism</span>: ceding sovereignty to AI in data cleaning, pattern recognition, and predictive analytics, while retaining human authority in value judgments, ethical trade-offs, and strategic intuition. Leaders must become "<b>cognitive interface designers</b>," crafting human-AI collaboration workflows and defining clear feedback loops: "AI suggestion → human judgment."
            </p>
            <div class="quote">
                <strong>Key Insight</strong>: <em>When algorithms can think, a leader's value is no longer in "knowing more," but in "knowing when not to delegate to algorithms."</em>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Leap Two: Constructing Systemic Psychological Resilience – From Emotional Management to Immune Enhancement</h2>
            <p>
                Employee anxiety, burnout, and a lack of belonging are no longer "individual psychological issues"—they are <span class="highlight">immune deficiencies of the organizational system</span>. Traditional leadership focuses on "motivation," yet overlooks the construction of the "psychological ecosystem."
            </p>
            <p>
                We advocate for "<b>Psychological Immune Leadership</b>": leaders must act like immunologists, identifying "psychological pathogens" in the organization (e.g., information overload, delayed feedback, meaning vacuum), and cultivating "antibodies"—<b>transparent communication, a culture of psychological safety, and error-tolerance mechanisms</b>. This is not merely care, but <span class="highlight">infrastructure for organizational antifragility</span>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Establish a "Mental Health Dashboard," integrating employee emotional data into organizational health metrics;</li>
                <li>Practice "Vulnerability Leadership"—leaders openly share failures and uncertainties, dismantling the myth of the "perfect leader."</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="quote">
                <strong>Cross-Section Resonance</strong>: <em>When humans and machines share cognitive sovereignty, human emotion and meaning become the rarest "sovereign assets."</em>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Leap Three: Co-Creating the Organizational Meaning Ecosystem – From Meaning Imposition to Meaning Co-Creation</h2>
            <p>
                Gen Z refuses to "work for the boss's dream." They ask: "Why am I here?" Traditional leadership tries to "impose meaning," but digital natives yearn for <span class="highlight">participation in meaning-making</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                "<b>Meaning Co-Creation</b>" is not a slogan—it is the <span class="highlight">co-building of a meaning ecosystem</span>: leaders shift from "meaning distributors" to "meaning curators," enabling every member to become both contributor and beneficiary of meaning through <b>story co-creation, mission iteration, and value dialogues</b>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Host "Meaning Workshops," where employees use AI to generate personal mission statements, then collectively select organizational-level value keywords;</li>
                <li>Implement "Reverse Performance Reviews"—employees explain to executives "How I understand the company's mission."</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="quote">
                <strong>Key Takeaway</strong>: <em>In an era of meaning vacuum, leadership is not the provider of answers, but the igniter of questions.</em>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Underlying Logic of the Triple Leap: From Control to Co-Construction</h2>
            <p>
                The three leaps are not parallel—they represent a <span class="highlight">progressive systemic reconstruction</span>:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Cognitive Leap</b>: Addresses "<b>how to think</b>"—reconstructing human-machine power dynamics;</li>
                <li><b>Psychological Leap</b>: Addresses "<b>how to feel</b>"—rebuilding the organization's emotional foundation;</li>
                <li><b>Meaning Leap</b>: Addresses "<b>why we exist</b>"—reinventing the organization's value foundation.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Together, they form the "<b>Leadership Co-Construction Triangle</b>": cognition is the <span class="highlight">foundation of capability</span>, psychology is the <span class="highlight">emotional bond</span>, and meaning is the <span class="highlight">guiding beacon of value</span>. Missing any one leads to systemic imbalance—cognition without psychology makes the organization a machine; psychology without meaning makes it a mob.
            </p>
            <div class="quote">
                <strong>Conceptual Elevation</strong>: <em>The most dangerous leadership in the digital age is not incompetence, but "doing the wrong thing efficiently." Only through the triple awakening of cognition, psychology, and meaning can we prevent technological empowerment from becoming value disempowerment.</em>

            <h2>Leadership Action Guide: Three Immediately Applicable Principles</h2>
            <p>
                Ideas must be implemented. Based on the triple leap, we distill three <b>actionable, verifiable</b> leadership principles:
            </p>
            <h3>1. Weekly "Cognitive Sovereignty Audit"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Action</b>: Hold a 15-minute "Human-AI Decision Review" with your team weekly. Reflect: Which decisions were AI-driven? Which were human-judged? Did "algorithmic dependence" or "human bias" emerge?</li>
                <li><b>Value</b>: Build meta-cognitive awareness of human-AI collaboration, preventing sovereignty imbalance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Monthly "Psychological Immunity Vaccination"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Action</b>: Host a "Vulnerability Dialogue" monthly—a leader shares a failed decision; the team shares a psychological stressor; together, they design a coping mechanism.</li>
                <li><b>Value</b>: Institutionalize psychological resilience, shifting from "firefighting" to "prevention."</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Quarterly "Meaning Co-Creation Ritual"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Action</b>: Host a "Mission Iteration Session" quarterly. Use AI to generate individual value maps, team-vote on 3 new organizational value words, and design 1 practical experiment.</li>
                <li><b>Value</b>: Transform meaning from "top-down" to "bottom-up," creating a dynamic meaning ecosystem.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion: The Future of Leadership is a Co-Constructed Civilization</h2>
            <p>
                In the digital age, leadership is no longer the privilege of the few, but a <span class="highlight">collective movement of co-constructing cognition, emotion, and meaning</span>. The true leader does not stand above, issuing orders—but kneels down, drawing maps, tuning systems, and igniting meaning alongside the team.
            </p>
            <p>
                As machines become more like humans, humans must become more authentically human—with judgment, emotion, and purpose. <b>The ultimate mission of leadership is not to master technology, but to safeguard humanity; not to produce efficiency, but to nurture meaning.</b>
            </p>
            <div class="quote">
                <strong>Final Insight</strong>: <em>In the flood of algorithms, only meaning stands as humanity's final fortress—and leadership is the builder of that fortress's walls.</em>
