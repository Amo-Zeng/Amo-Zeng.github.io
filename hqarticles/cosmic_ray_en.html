            <h2>The Multifaceted Role of Cosmic Rays: A Temporal Link between Earth and the Cosmos</h2>
            <p>In the vast expanse of the universe, there exists a group of mysterious "time travelers" who come from ancient stars, spanning billions of years of time, eventually piercing through the atmosphere and landing on Earth, leaving behind a series of enigmatic puzzles. These "time travelers" are cosmic rays, the oldest messengers of information in the universe. Cosmic rays are not actual "rays" but streams of charged particles originating from deep space. They are mostly born from violent astronomical events such as supernova explosions and black hole consumption, carrying the codes from the birth of the universe. These particles travel through the cosmos at nearly the speed of light, weaving a mysterious information network across different temporal dimensions.</p>

            <h3>The Identity of Cosmic Rays as Time Travelers</h3>
            <p>When we gaze at the stars, the distances we perceive are limited to light-years, yet cosmic rays have already broken through the limitations of vision. They can reach distant galaxies beyond the reach of human telescopes and traverse extreme environments unreachable by human probes. Each cosmic ray particle that reaches Earth is a letter across time, narrating the stories of deep space. However, these time travelers are not mere messengers. They carry firsthand data from extreme physical environments, making them excellent samples for studying high-energy physics. On Earth, scientists have built a layered network of detectors, like Earth's open eyes, capturing these particles from deep space. Through the study of cosmic rays, we can not only unlock the mysteries of the universe's origin but also explore the behavior of matter under extreme conditions.</p>

            <h3>The Identity of Cosmic Rays as Dark Matter Probes</h3>
            <p>In the vast universe, dark matter constitutes 85% of the total matter, invisible and intangible, yet its existence has been confirmed by various indirect evidences. Cosmic rays, especially high-energy cosmic rays, may interact with dark matter particles, producing observable signals. These signals may include high-energy photons, neutrinos, or other secondary particles. Through the analysis of these signals, scientists hope to find direct evidence of dark matter.</p>
            <p>The existence of dark matter is primarily confirmed indirectly through gravitational effects, such as galaxy rotation curves and gravitational lensing. However, to directly detect dark matter, we need more information. Cosmic rays, particularly high-energy cosmic rays, could be the key to unveiling the mystery of dark matter. As high-energy cosmic rays travel through the universe, they may interact with dark matter particles, producing high-energy photons or other secondary particles. These secondary particles can be captured by detectors on Earth, providing direct evidence of dark matter. By analyzing the energy, direction, and temporal distribution of these signals, scientists can infer the distribution and properties of dark matter.</p>

            <h3>The Identity of Cosmic Rays as Earth Environmental Monitors</h3>
            <p>In addition to serving as messengers of the universe and probes of dark matter, cosmic rays are also Earth's "environmental monitors." They carry information about both the Earth's internal and external environments, providing a unique key to unlocking the mysteries of Earth's environmental changes.</p>
            <p>Cosmic rays consist of high-energy particles from deep space, traveling at nearly the speed of light through cosmic space before reaching Earth. When these high-energy particles collide with atomic nuclei in Earth's atmosphere, they produce a series of secondary particles, which then interact with atmospheric molecules, forming what are known as "secondary cosmic ray particles." These secondary cosmic ray particles are closely related to the Earth's environment, and their numbers and distribution are influenced by various factors, such as solar activity, geomagnetic field changes, and atmospheric composition and density.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>As a temporal link between Earth and the cosmos, cosmic rays' multifaceted roles not only provide us with the keys to explore the mysteries of the universe but also reveal the changes in Earth's environment. They are messengers of the universe, carrying information from ancient stars; they are probes of dark matter, helping us uncover the truth behind the universe's most mysterious substance; they are environmental monitors of Earth, providing us with a unique perspective to interpret the changes in Earth's internal and external environments.</p>
