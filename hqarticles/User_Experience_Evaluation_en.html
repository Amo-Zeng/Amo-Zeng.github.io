            <h2>1. Theoretical Framework: From Static Usability to Dynamic Cognitive Rhythm</h2>
            <p>Traditional user experience (UX) evaluation primarily focuses on static metrics such as task completion rate and error rate, often overlooking the <strong>dynamic flow of attention</strong> in multitasking environments. This article proposes the <strong>Attention Fragmentation Index</strong> (AFI), a dynamic modeling framework that integrates eye-tracking data (fixation switching frequency, saccadic path complexity) with electroencephalography (EEG) signals—particularly changes in theta (θ) and alpha (α) band power.</p>
            <p>The core of AFI is the <strong>Attention Switching Cost</strong> (ASC), which quantifies the cognitive resources required when users shift between tasks. Eye-tracking reveals <strong>overt behavioral patterns</strong> (e.g., frequent fixation shifts), while EEG uncovers <strong>covert cognitive load</strong> (e.g., increased prefrontal theta power indicating working memory load). Together, they enable the quantification of time-varying ASC, mapping the processes of cognitive rhythm disruption and restoration.</p>
            <p>More critically, multitasking interfaces induce a <strong>fragmented cognitive rhythm</strong> through high-frequency stimuli—where attention jumps in short cycles and at high frequency, preventing sustained deep cognition. This rhythm reshaping not only reduces task efficiency but also leads to cognitive fatigue and degraded decision-making quality.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>2. Empirical Evidence: Eye Tracking and EEG Reveal the Mechanisms of Switching Cost</h2>
            <p>A lab study recruited 30 participants to perform simulated office tasks using a dual-task interface (email processing + instant messaging). Simultaneous eye-tracking (Tobii Pro Fusion) and 64-channel EEG data were collected, revealing the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Behavioral level</strong>: When more than five task entry points were present, fixation switching frequency increased by 47%, and average task completion time rose by 32%;</li>
                <li><strong>Neural level</strong>: Each task switch was accompanied by a significant increase in theta power (p < 0.01), and alpha wave suppression persisted for 3–5 seconds after switching, indicating the time needed for cognitive resource reallocation;</li>
                <li><strong>Rhythm disruption</strong>: When task-switching intervals were shorter than 8 seconds, EEG exhibited a "fragmented oscillation pattern," significantly positively correlated with subjective fatigue (NASA-TLX) (r = 0.71).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Further analysis showed a strong correlation between <strong>spatial clustering of visual distractors</strong> (e.g., multiple pop-ups side-by-side) and AFI (r = 0.68), while <strong>semantic coherence across tasks</strong> (e.g., contextual links between emails and calendars) reduced ASC by up to 29%. This confirms that interface design not only influences behavior but also reshapes cognitive rhythm through neural mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>3. Design Implications: Principles for Anti-Fragmentation Interaction</h2>
            <p>Based on the AFI model, we propose three actionable design principles:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rhythm Anchor Design</strong><br>
                    Introduce "cognitive anchors" (e.g., fixed taskbars, progress visualizations) to help users establish attention rhythm. Empirical evidence shows that anchors can extend average task-switching intervals from 5.2 to 9.8 seconds, significantly reducing theta wave fluctuations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pre-Switch Cost Prompting</strong><br>
                    When users are about to switch to a high-load task, use micro-interactions (e.g., fade animations, audio cues) to provide a "cognitive transition buffer," enabling the alpha wave to enter a ready state in advance and reducing post-switch cognitive delay.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Spatial-Semantic Coupled Layout</strong><br>
                    Group functional entry points by semantic task categories and reduce visual element density (recommended: ≤3 core entries per screen). Experiments show this layout reduces AFI by 34% and produces a more stable θ-α coupling pattern in EEG.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Additionally, we recommend integrating AFI into a UX dashboard for <strong>real-time experience monitoring</strong>. For example, when AFI exceeds a threshold for three consecutive minutes, the system could automatically activate a "Deep Focus Mode," hiding non-urgent notifications.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Attention fragmentation is not merely a design issue—it is fundamentally a neurocognitive challenge. By fusing eye-tracking and EEG data, we can reframe UX evaluation from the perspective of "cognitive rhythm." Future design should shift from "capturing attention" to "protecting attention," seeking a balance between efficiency and sustainability, and ultimately serving human cognitive well-being.</p>
