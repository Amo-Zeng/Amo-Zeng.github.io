            <h2>Introduction: The Complexity of Sanctions and Their Multidimensional Impact</h2>
            <p>Economic sanctions, as a commonly used "non-violent" tool in international politics, are traditionally seen as a means to compel target countries to change their behavior. However, with the deepening of globalization and rapid technological advancements, the impact of sanctions has far exceeded the purely economic realm, extending into multiple dimensions of cognition, power structures, and institutional evolution. This article explores how economic sanctions reshape the global order from the perspectives of cognitive warfare, the restructuring of global economic power, and institutional adaptation, revealing their complex and far-reaching long-term effects.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>I. Cognitive Warfare: Sanctions as the Construction of the "Other" and the Distortion of Information Ecosystems</h3>
            <p>Sanctions are not merely tools of economic pressure but also a means of cognitive warfare. By cutting off or distorting information flows, sanctioning countries attempt to reshape the collective psychology of target nations and the power balance in the international public opinion arena.</p>
            
            <h4>1. The Construction of the "Other" and the Strengthening of Nationalism</h4>
            <p>At the core of sanctions is a "boundary-drawing act" that marks the target country as an "outlier" in the international community. This labeling often becomes excellent material for the sanctioned government to craft a "besieged narrative." For example, after the 2014 Crimea crisis, Russia described the sanctions as a "Western conspiracy to contain Russia's revival," which instead solidified public support for the government. Similar phenomena are common in long-sanctioned countries like Iran and Venezuela.</p>
            
            <h4>2. The Distortion of Information Ecosystems and the Formation of "Cognitive Islands"</h4>
            <p>Modern sanctions often come with technological blockades, such as restrictions on internet services or financial payment tools, directly interfering with the target country's information ecosystem. When sanctions cut off international social media or news channels, governments may seize the opportunity to promote local alternatives, such as Russia's VKontakte and Iran's "National Information Network," while strengthening censorship of external information. This "digital sovereignty" process, under the guise of "counter-sanctions," actually consolidates the authoritarian regime's information monopoly.</p>
            
            <h4>3. The Long-Term Game of Cognitive Warfare</h4>
            <p>Both sides of the sanctions engage in a propaganda war over "who is more moral," splitting global public opinion into multiple "information silos." In the future, the effectiveness of sanctions will increasingly depend on narrative power, information resilience, and the polarization of public perception. In the dimension of cognitive warfare, sanctions may no longer be a "pressure tool" but a prolonged contest over "who defines reality."</p>

            <h3>II. The Restructuring of Global Economic Power: The Rise of Non-State Actors</h3>
            <p>With the deepening of globalization, the impact of sanctions has transcended state-to-state confrontations, reshaping the global economic power structure. Non-state actors, such as multinational corporations, cryptocurrency markets, and offshore financial centers, are becoming new centers of economic power.</p>
            
            <h4>1. Multinational Corporations: New Power Centers Under Sanctions</h4>
            <p>Multinational corporations, with their vast resources and global operational networks, can bypass sanctions through complex supply chain management and financial engineering. For example, under U.S. sanctions, Huawei accelerated the development of its own chips and operating systems, gradually reducing its dependence on U.S. technology, showcasing the resilience and innovation of multinational corporations under sanction pressures.</p>
            
            <h4>2. Cryptocurrency Markets: Decentralized Economic Power</h4>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies, as decentralized digital currencies, provide sanctioned countries with alternatives to bypass traditional financial system restrictions. For example, when a country is cut off from the SWIFT system, its businesses may turn to cryptocurrency-based trading systems to continue international trade. The rise of cryptocurrencies not only challenges the authority of traditional financial systems but also offers new possibilities for the multipolarization of global economic power.</p>
            
            <h4>3. Offshore Financial Centers: Sanction Havens</h4>
            <p>Offshore financial centers, by offering low tax rates, lax regulations, and anonymous accounts, become havens under sanctions. For example, the Cayman Islands and Bermuda provide alternative financial services to sanctioned countries, helping them bypass sanction restrictions. The existence of offshore financial centers diminishes the effectiveness of sanctions and exacerbates the complexity of global economic governance.</p>
            
            <h4>4. Sanction-Driven Technological Innovation: Reshaping the Global Economic Order</h4>
            <p>Sanction-driven technological innovations, such as cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, are challenging the authority of traditional financial systems. For example, the development of decentralized finance weakens developed countries' control over global economic governance. Sanctions not only accelerate technological innovation in target countries but also drive the redistribution of technological power globally.</p>

            <h3>III. Institutional Adaptation and Counter-Sanction Culture: From Passive Defense to Active Restructuring</h3>
            <p>Sanctions often become catalysts for institutional change in target countries, giving rise to a "counter-sanction culture" that not only restructures domestic political and economic orders but may also form new governance models with demonstrative effects.</p>
            
            <h4>1. The Forging of Institutional Resilience</h4>
            <p>Sanctions cut off technological supply chains, forcing target countries to restructure their industrial ecosystems. For example, after 2014, Russia launched an "import substitution" strategy, with wheat production becoming the world's largest. However, this "survival by breaking chains" may lead to a "low-level equilibrium," as seen in Iran's automotive industry, which achieved 90% localization but stagnated at 2000s technology levels. While sanctions enhance institutional resilience, they may also bring technological stagnation and innovation limitations.</p>
            
            <h4>2. The Recentralization of Power Structures</h4>
            <p>The scarcity of resources caused by sanctions strengthens the regime's control over key supplies. For example, during the Syrian war, the government linked food distribution to political loyalty through a "rationing system." Additionally, sanctions may prompt target countries to build parallel systems, such as Russia's SPFS and Iran's SEPAM cross-border settlement mechanisms, challenging the SWIFT monopoly. This recentralization of power structures not only consolidates government control but also exacerbates the fragmentation of the international financial system.</p>
            
            <h4>3. The Emergence of Counter-Sanction Culture</h4>
            <p>The economic hardships caused by sanctions may be transformed into symbols of "national sacrifice," as seen in Cuba's post-Cold War narrative of "resisting U.S. hegemony" as the core of national identity. This narrative turns economic difficulties into a sense of moral superiority, weakening the political effectiveness of sanctions. Moreover, sanctions drive target countries to form alternative alliances, such as technological cooperation between China and Russia, further undermining the moral discourse of sanctioning countries. The emergence of counter-sanction culture not only enhances internal cohesion in target countries but also provides reference models for other countries to respond to sanctions.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Complexity of Sanctions and the Reshaping of Global Order</h3>
            <p>Economic sanctions have evolved from simple economic tools to core components of hybrid warfare, with their impact spanning multiple dimensions of cognition, power structures, and institutional evolution. The future effectiveness of sanctions will depend on the following factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Narrative Power:</strong> Who can more effectively justify the "moral legitimacy" of sanctions?</li>
                <li><strong>Information Resilience:</strong> Can target countries build autonomous information ecosystems?</li>
                <li><strong>The Multipolarization of Global Economic Power:</strong> How will non-state actors play a role in the global economic order?</li>
                <li><strong>Institutional Flexibility:</strong> Can target countries transform sanction pressures into long-term strategic advantages through institutional adaptation?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Under the multidimensional impact of cognitive warfare, the restructuring of global economic power, and institutional adaptation, sanctions may no longer be a "pressure tool" but a prolonged contest over the reshaping of the global order. As Russian economist Gref said, "Sanctions are like antibiotics; overuse only breeds more resistant strains." In the future, the international community will need to more carefully and comprehensively assess the complexity and long-term effects of sanctions.</p>
