            <h2>Protection and Promotion of Global Language Diversity</h2>
            <p>In the contemporary globalized world, language is not only a bridge of communication but also a vivid representation of cultural diversity. However, as globalization continues to advance, the diversity of languages is facing unprecedented challenges. To overcome language barriers and enhance cultural exchange, we propose two pioneering strategies: the cross-cultural integration language strategy and the digital language preservation strategy. These two strategies, like the wings of cultural exchange, jointly promote the prosperous development of global languages and cultures.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Cross-Cultural Integration Language Strategy</h3>
            <p>The cross-cultural integration language strategy aims to create a globally universal "world language" that integrates the essence of various cultures, not only offering universality but also respecting cultural diversity. Through deep integration of vocabularies, grammatical structures, and cultural elements, this new language can effectively reduce language barriers in global communication, promote the coexistence and exchange of cultural diversity, and enhance global citizens' profound understanding and wide acceptance of multiculturalism.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Digital Language Preservation Strategy</h3>
            <p>The digital language preservation strategy utilizes advanced digital technology to comprehensively record and archive endangered languages. By creating detailed online dictionaries, corpora, and multimedia resource libraries, endangered languages are preserved permanently in the digital world. Additionally, the development of interactive learning tools and global knowledge-sharing platforms makes learning endangered languages more engaging and promotes their practical application in daily life, strengthening their vitality.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Future Prospects of the Dual-Wing Strategy</h3>
            <p>These two strategies complement each other and jointly safeguard the future of languages. The cross-cultural integration language strategy provides a new bridge for global communication, while the digital language preservation strategy offers a digital ark for endangered languages. In the digital wave, we not only protect those vanishing voices but also open a new era of flourishing language diversity. Looking forward, with technological advancements and deepening global cultural exchange, these strategies are expected to be applied more broadly worldwide. They will jointly contribute to building a more harmonious and understanding world and contribute to the progress of human society.</p>
