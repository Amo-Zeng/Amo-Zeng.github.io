            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Emotions, the ripples of the human soul, are often difficult to express. In traditional art therapy, concrete expressions are commonly used as bridges connecting the inner self with the external world. However, Abstract Expressionism's "unconscious" creative approach provides a more direct and profound path for emotional release. This article will explore the close relationship between the mental state of Abstract Expressionist artists and their works, analyze the healing effects of their works on the artists themselves, and imagine integrating Abstract Expressionist works into psychotherapy scenarios. Additionally, we will explore how combining Abstract Expressionism with other art forms and digital technologies can transform these works into audiovisual synesthesia and tactile experiences, integrating them into digital interaction design to create a more diverse, inclusive, and imaginative digital world.</p>

            <h2>Abstract Expressionism's "Unconscious" Creation and Emotional Release</h2>
            <p>Abstract Expressionism, born in the mid-20th century, is renowned for its free and unrestrained brushstrokes and boundless use of color. Artists often let emotions and subconscious thoughts guide their brushes, free from the constraints of reality. This "unconscious" creative process allows the artwork to become a direct carrier of emotions. For example, Jackson Pollock's drip painting, with its random splashes and splatters, showcases his deep-seated anxiety and struggles, while also releasing these emotions. This creative approach not only provides artists with emotional purification but also offers viewers an emotional resonance.</p>

            <h2>The Relationship Between an Artist's Mental State and Their Work</h2>
            <p>The works of Abstract Expressionist artists often have a profound internal connection with their mental states. Artists express unspeakable emotions through their creations, with their works serving as mirrors of their souls. For instance, Barnett Newman's "Zip" series, with its simple yet powerful lines, reflects his deep contemplation of existential issues. These works not only mirror the artists' inner worlds but also serve as tools for self-healing. Through creation, artists transform their inner emotions into visible forms, and this transformation process itself is a form of healing.</p>

            <h2>Abstract Expressionism and Digital Interaction Experience</h2>
            <p>When we face screens, we are accustomed to receiving precise information, from clear images to precise code, the digital world constructs a rational and orderly mirror of reality for us. However, the ambiguity and uncertainty of Abstract Expressionism serve as a key, opening another door to digital interaction experiences. It encourages us to break the boundaries between inside and outside the screen, interacting with the digital world in a more emotional and free manner.</p>
            <p>The creative approach of Abstract Expressionism inherently contains a strong interactivity: the audience is guided to participate in interpreting the work, attributing personalized meanings to it. The field of digital interaction design can draw inspiration from this interactive model, integrating abstract art elements into interfaces, icons, dynamic effects, etc., to create a more immersive and interactive user experience. For example, developing dynamic wallpapers based on abstract art can allow users to experience dynamic changes in color and shape when unlocking their phones or switching applications, feeling an emotional resonance from the digital world. It is even possible to combine abstract art with game mechanics, encouraging players to use elements such as color and line to create, constructing their own visual experiences, realizing the fusion of games and art.</p>

            <h2>Synesthesia: The Symphony of Painting, Music, and Dance</h2>
            <p>The core of Abstract Expressionism lies in its free handling of form and direct expression of emotion. This characteristic makes it naturally compatible with art forms such as music and dance. When we attempt to combine Abstract Expressionist paintings with music, we can find that many Abstract Expressionist painters' works have a strong sense of rhythm and melody, almost "audible" in their melodies and harmonies. For example, Pollock's "action painting" works, with their freely flung brushstrokes and intertwined colors, resemble an impromptu jazz performance, full of vitality and dynamism. Meanwhile, dance, as another temporal art, can also resonate strongly with Abstract Expressionist paintings. Dancers can interpret the abstract shapes and dynamics in the paintings through bodily movements, transforming the emotions in the paintings into concrete body language. This cross-art form synesthetic experience not only enriches the audience's sensory experience but also deepens their understanding of Abstract Expressionist works.</p>

            <h2>Tactile Experience: The "Sculptural" Transformation of Paintings</h2>
            <p>Another important feature of Abstract Expressionist painting is its strong tactile elements. Painters use thick paint, rough textures, and irregular brushstrokes to give the work a tactile feel. However, traditional viewing methods only allow the audience to perceive these tactile elements visually. To break this limitation, we can try to transform Abstract Expressionist paintings into tactile experiences, developing "sculptures" that can be touched. Specifically, we can use 3D printing technology to create sculptures with similar textures and tactile sensations based on Abstract Expressionist painters' works. These sculptures not only retain the original shapes and colors of the works but also allow the audience to feel the brushstrokes and tension of the painting through touch. Through touch, we can more deeply understand the emotional state of the painter during creation, and even "feel" the strength and impulse of their brushstrokes. This transformation of tactile experience not only allows the audience to more directly feel the emotional expression of Abstract Expressionism but also provides a new possibility for the interdisciplinary fusion of art forms.</p>

            <h2>Transcendence and Future Outlook of Multisensory Experiences</h2>
            <p>As a form of visual art, Abstract Expressionism's radical form language and strong emotional expression actually have the potential to trigger multisensory experiences. By combining Abstract Expressionist works with art forms such as music and dance, we can explore the possibilities of audiovisual synesthesia, allowing the audience to feel the charm of art through hearing and kinaesthetic senses in addition to vision. At the same time, by transforming painting works into tactile experiences, we can break the limitations of traditional viewing methods, allowing the audience to more directly feel the brushstrokes and tension of the painting. This multisensory experience not only enriches the audience's artistic perception but also provides new dimensions for interpreting Abstract Expressionism.</p>
            <p>The combination of Abstract Expressionism and digital interaction experiences provides us with a new perspective, allowing us to re-examine the possibilities of the digital world. In the future, with the continuous development of technology, we have reason to believe that abstract art will inject more inspiration and vitality into digital interaction experiences, creating even more astonishing digital works, leading us to explore the infinite possibilities between the digital world and human emotions and consciousness.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Abstract Expressionism, as a tool for emotional expression and healing, offers a unique path for emotional release through its "unconscious" creative approach. The close connection between an artist's mental state and their work reveals the healing potential of artistic creation. Integrating Abstract Expressionism into psychotherapy can not only help patients express and process emotions but also provide a new way of self-exploration and healing. The combination of Abstract Expressionist works and digital interaction experiences offers the audience a more diverse, inclusive, and imaginative digital world. Through the transformation of audiovisual synesthesia and tactile experiences, we can explore the multisensory potential of Abstract Expressionism, allowing artistic works to thrive in a multidimensional sensory world. In this process, art becomes a decoder of emotions, bringing deep healing and liberation to the soul.</p>
