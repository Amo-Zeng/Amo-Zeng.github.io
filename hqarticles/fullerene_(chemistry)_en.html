            <h2>Exploring New Forms of Life in the Universe and the Future Tech Revolution</h2>
            <p>Since ancient times, humans have gazed at the stars, attempting to solve an eternal mystery: does other life exist in the universe? For a long time, our understanding of life has been limited to carbon-based life forms on Earth. However, with rapid technological advancements and deeper space exploration, scientists have begun to question: must life be based on carbon? Could there be "alien life" composed of other elements? In this exploration, fullerenes, with their unique structures and properties, have become a focal point for scientists, providing theoretical foundations for the "fullerene life" hypothesis while also sparking revolutionary changes in materials science, chemistry, and the future of technology.</p>

            <h3>Limitations of Carbon-Based Life</h3>
            <p>All known life forms on Earth, including humans, are built on carbon, hence referred to as "carbon-based life." Carbon atoms have four valence electrons, capable of forming stable and diverse covalent bonds, thereby constructing complex organic molecules such as proteins, DNA, and RNA, which are essential for life activities. However, carbon-based life also has significant limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limited Environmental Adaptability</strong>: Carbon-based life is highly sensitive to factors like temperature, pressure, and radiation. For instance, high temperatures can denature proteins, and strong radiation can damage DNA structures, posing threats to life survival.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Energy Utilization Efficiency</strong>: The energy metabolism processes (like respiration and photosynthesis) of carbon-based life are relatively inefficient, making it difficult to support more advanced life forms.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Information Storage and Processing</strong>: Although DNA and RNA can store vast genetic information, their information density and processing speed are still limited, unable to meet the demands of more advanced intelligent life.</li>
            </ul>
