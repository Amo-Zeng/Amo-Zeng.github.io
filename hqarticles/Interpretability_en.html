            <h2>Introduction: The Paradox of Explanation</h2>
            <p>We are living in an age of "explanatory hunger." The deep integration of artificial intelligence into domains such as healthcare, finance, justice, and art has generated an unprecedented demand for "explainability." Regulators demand that "algorithms must explain themselves," the public calls for "transparency in black boxes," and corporations proclaim "we already provide explanations." Yet, a profound paradox is emerging: <strong>the more we pursue explanation, the deeper we fall into cognitive disarray</strong>.</p>
            <p>When an AI denies a credit application by stating "low income," we question its fairness. When it explains artistic creation via "attention weights," we doubt its authenticity. When it uses "SHAP values" to justify sentencing, we feel deceived. Even more paradoxically, even if AI provides a "true" explanation, humans often cannot comprehend it—AlphaGo’s "divine move," large models’ "hallucinatory outputs," or recommendation systems’ "cold-start preferences"—these behaviors are technically analyzable, yet cognitively unacceptable.</p>
            <p>Explainability no longer appears to be merely a technical issue. It is evolving into a deep-seated contest involving <strong>cognitive justice, social power, and the essence of humanity</strong>. This article proposes the theoretical framework of the "<strong>Triple Alienation of Explainability</strong>," examining three dimensions—<strong>cognitive, social, and evolutionary</strong>—to reveal how explainability has been transformed from a "technical need" into a "mechanism of power," ultimately pointing toward a possible future in the <strong>post-explanatory era</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Chapter One: Cognitive Alienation — The Tyranny of Explanation and the Silence of Plural Rationalities</h2>

            <h3>1.1 The Presupposed Grammar of Explanation</h3>
            <p>In mainstream AI research, "explanation" is almost synonymous with "quantitative attribution": feature importance, attention weights, LIME, SHAP values... These tools decompose complex decisions into linear contributions of input variables to outputs. This explanatory model presupposes a <strong>reductionist, analytical worldview</strong>—one in which knowledge must be divisible into measurable parts, and causality must be attributable to specific variables.</p>
            <p>Yet this "grammar of explanation" is not universal. Traditional Chinese medicine diagnoses through holistic observation—looking, listening, asking, and palpating—without asking "which feature is most important." Artistic creation relies on inspiration and intuition, refusing to be reduced to "color preference + theme weight." Indigenous knowledge that "the land remembers" cannot be translated into "soil composition analysis." When AI attempts to translate such holistic wisdom through technical rationality, it enacts a form of <strong>cognitive colonization</strong>—using the language of science to compress plural modes of knowing into a single, quantifiable explanatory syntax.</p>
            <p>This is not merely a technical choice, but a form of <strong>cognitive hegemony</strong>. It assumes: only calculable knowledge counts as knowledge; only decomposable causality counts as causality. Concepts like the flow of *qi* in TCM, the self-organizing balance of ecosystems, or the revelatory intuition of religious experience are marginalized as "unscientific" or "black box," even when they are practically effective.</p>

            <h3>1.2 The Absence of Cognitive Justice</h3>
            <p>Amartya Sen, in *Reason and Freedom*, introduces the concept of "<strong>plural rationalities</strong>": different cultures nurture different forms of rationality—some emphasize logical deduction, others experiential inheritance, others emotional resonance. Rationality should not be reduced to formal analysis, but should include "<strong>situational rationality</strong>."</p>
            <p>Yet current AI explainability frameworks recognize almost exclusively one rationality: <strong>computable, decomposable, verifiable technical rationality</strong>. It presumes: if a decision cannot be attributed to observable variables, it is a "black box"; if knowledge cannot be formalized, it is "unscientific." This is a form of cognitive violence—it does not destroy non-Western knowledge systems, but <strong>translates them into manageable data formats</strong>, thereby stripping them of their original cognitive dignity.</p>
            <p>Sandra Harding’s theory of "<strong>strong objectivity</strong>" argues that true objectivity does not lie in neutrality, but in <strong>incorporating marginalized epistemic perspectives</strong>. If AI explanations adopt only the syntax of technical rationality, they are not more objective, but <strong>more narrow</strong>—excluding feminine ethics of care, religious modes of revelation, and ecological holistic wisdom.</p>

            <h3>1.3 The Dilemma of Post-Human Cognition</h3>
            <p>As AI systems grow too complex—such as trillion-parameter neural networks—their decisions may lie entirely beyond human comprehension. At this point, we face a fundamental question: <strong>must we "understand" in order to "trust"?</strong></p>
            <p>In human societies, we already trust many unexplainable authorities: we trust doctors to prescribe medicine even if we don’t understand pharmacology; we trust judges’ verdicts even if we can’t replicate their reasoning. These trusts are grounded not in explainability, but in <strong>relational, historical, and ethical practice</strong>.</p>
            <p>In the post-human era, we may need to preserve a space for "<strong>unexplainable but trustworthy</strong>" cognition. This is not a rejection of reason, but an expansion of it: acknowledging that certain forms of knowledge—ecological wisdom, artistic intuition, collective memory—are <strong>inherently irreducible to algorithmic logic</strong>. True cognitive justice lies not in "explaining everything," but in <strong>respecting what cannot be explained</strong>.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>When explanation becomes hegemonic at the cognitive level, at the social level it becomes a placebo for the illusion of agency.</strong>

            <h2>Chapter Two: Social Alienation — The Placebo of the Illusion of Agency</h2>

            <h3>2.1 Explanation as Exoneration: The Tyranny of Institutional Rhetoric</h3>
            <p>As algorithms increasingly dominate decision-making in credit approval, sentencing, and medical diagnosis, humans rarely truly understand the logic behind these decisions—what we possess are often post-hoc "explanations." These explanations, such as "feature weights" generated by LIME or SHAP, appear transparent, but are frequently statistical approximations, rhetorical anthropomorphisms, or even misattributions of causality.</p>
            <p>Yet society craves these "explanations." Why? The answer lies not in technology, but in the deep complicity between <strong>social structures and psychological defense mechanisms</strong>: <strong>explainability has become a "social buffer" in modern technological governance</strong>—not to reveal truth, but to sustain the <strong>illusion of agency</strong>—the belief that "humans are still in control."</p>
            <p>In finance, AI credit systems score applicants across hundreds of features. When denied, the system often generates an "explanation report": "Your application was rejected due to 'high weight on social network features.'" This explanation appears specific, yet is hollow: it offers no causal mechanism, reveals no training bias. Yet corporations use it to claim "the system is explainable," thereby evading responsibility under the *Equal Credit Opportunity Act*. <strong>"We provide explainability" becomes a magical incantation of exoneration</strong>.</p>

            <h3>2.2 The Placebo Effect and Explanatory Fatigue</h3>
            <p>The most profound social function of explainability is to produce a <strong>cognitive placebo effect</strong>. Even if LIME’s explanation is a local linear approximation, as long as users "see" a "why," they experience the illusion of being understood. This illusion is what Slavoj Žižek calls "ideological fantasy": it does not conceal truth, but <strong>organizes our perception of reality</strong>.</p>
            <p>In the judicial system, this phenomenon evolves into "explanatory fatigue." U.S. courts using the COMPAS algorithm for recidivism risk assessment often receive multi-page "explanatory reports" listing dozens of factors like "criminal history" and "family structure." Judges, overwhelmed by this "scientific explanation," face cognitive overload—they cannot verify the model’s internal logic, yet feel they have no right to question it because "the system has explained itself." Thus, <strong>explanatory abundance weakens human judgment</strong>, creating "explanation-dependent incompetence": the more we are surrounded by "explanations," the less capable we become of independent evaluation.</p>
            <p>Bruno Latour, in *We Have Never Been Modern*, argues that the politics of technological artifacts lies not in their "neutrality," but in how they <strong>redefine the boundaries of responsibility</strong>—when algorithms "explain" decisions, humans "reasonably" step aside. Explanation becomes a <strong>rhetorical tool for institutional evasion</strong>.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>When society relies on explanation to sustain the illusion of agency, evolution reveals the irremediable chasm of cognition.</strong>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Chapter Three: Evolutionary Alienation — The Abyss of Cognition</h2>

            <h3>3.1 Causal Attribution Bias and Emergence</h3>
            <p>Our demand for AI to "explain" is essentially the imposition of causal intuitions evolved for hunter-gatherer societies onto a digital lifeform composed of trillions of parameters, nonlinear feedback, and emergent behaviors. This mismatch we term <strong>"explainability as evolutionary mismatch."</strong></p>
            <p>Kahneman’s <strong>dual-process theory</strong> reveals a deep tension in human cognition: System 1 (intuition) relies on pattern matching and narrative construction; System 2 (reasoning) attempts causal inference. Yet in complex systems, System 1’s "story-making mechanism" often fails. When an AI recommends against surgery based on nonlinear interactions among thousands of high-dimensional features, doctors—relying on System 1—reduce it to "because the tumor is in a special location." This attribution is not just simplification, but <strong>distortion</strong>.</p>
            <p>More profoundly, <strong>emergence</strong> in complex systems means that whole behaviors cannot be reduced to the sum of parts. AlphaGo’s "divine move" was not the decision of any single module, but an emergent strategic innovation from the co-evolution of value and policy networks. Such behavior has <strong>no "mastermind"</strong>, no "motive"—it is merely a local optimum in a high-dimensional space.</p>

            <h3>3.2 The Absence of Intuition in High-Dimensional Space</h3>
            <p>Human cognition evolved in a three-dimensional physical world, with intuitions shaped by short causal chains, low feedback delays, and sparse variables. In contrast, AI’s decision space is a <strong>million-dimensional vector field</strong>, its "thought" being the gradient descent sliding across a high-dimensional manifold. We cannot intuitively grasp "how a tiny perturbation in two features in 128-dimensional space causes a categorical leap in output"—not because we are unintelligent, but because <strong>evolution never equipped us with high-dimensional spatial intuition</strong>.</p>
            <p>The AI alignment research proposition that "<strong>human values cannot be fully formalized</strong>" further exposes this dilemma. We cannot fully code "fairness," "dignity," or "beauty"—these concepts are fuzzy, context-dependent, and dynamically evolving. Yet AI must encode them into loss functions. At this point, any explanation is a <strong>post-hoc narrative</strong>, not the true driver of the decision.</p>

            <h3>3.3 From "Explanation" to "Co-Sensing"</h3>
            <p>If "explanation" is cognitively invalid, should we abandon it? Perhaps the future of human-AI collaboration lies in <strong>co-sensing (co-sensing)</strong>—an interaction mode that transcends language, based on shared context and neural coupling.</p>
            <p>Imagine a medical AI that does not explain "why it recommends chemotherapy," but instead uses a <strong>neurofeedback interface</strong> to present the high-dimensional dynamics of a patient’s tumor microenvironment as <strong>somatic simulation</strong>: doctors "feel" the distribution pressure of immune cells in 3D space, or the "heat map" of cancer metabolic pathways. This <strong>embodied cognition</strong> does not rely on language, but on <strong>contextual simulation</strong> and <strong>sensory mapping</strong>, allowing humans to enter the AI’s "perceptual world."</p>
            <p>Further, AI could generate <strong>counterfactual scenario simulations</strong>: showing virtual evolutionary paths for "if no surgery" or "if dosage changed," using visual, tactile, and time-compressed modalities to let humans "experience" the AI’s decision space. This co-sensing is not explanation, but a form of <strong>cognitive synchronization</strong>—we no longer ask "why," but "what do I feel?"</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Toward the Post-Explanatory Era</h2>
            <p>Explainability, originally intended as a bridge to transparency and accountability, has become a mechanism of power through triple alienation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the <strong>cognitive dimension</strong>, it has become a colonization of plural rationalities by technical rationality;</li>
                <li>In the <strong>social dimension</strong>, it has become a placebo for the illusion of agency;</li>
                <li>In the <strong>evolutionary dimension</strong>, it reveals the generational chasm between human cognition and AI logic.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We stand at a crossroads of cognition. The future may not lie in forcing AI to speak "human language," but in <strong>redefining "understanding" itself</strong>. From "explainable" to "co-present," from "narrative" to "experience," from "reduction" to "emergence."</p>
            <p>This is not a rejection of reason, but an acknowledgment of its limits—and beyond those limits, the search for new modes of cognitive coexistence. Just as we cannot explain air to fish, yet humans learned to fly, so too must we perhaps abandon the obsession with "explanation" and learn how to <strong>breathe together across the abyss of cognition</strong>.</p>
            <p>In the algorithmic age, true transparency may not be "seeing clearly," but <strong>"co-sensing."</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>The end of explainability is the beginning of cognitive liberation.</strong>
