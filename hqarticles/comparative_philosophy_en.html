            <h2>Image as Philosophy: Concepts of Reality in Chinese and Western Art</h2>
            <p>This article seeks to transcend the limitations of traditional comparative philosophical research, which is often centered on language and text, by introducing visual art as a medium of philosophical thought. It proposes an "inter-media comparative philosophy" approach. By comparing the concept of reality embodied in Chinese landscape painting — which reflects a unity of nature and inner vision — with the representation of emotional and cognitive structures in Western abstract expressionism, this article aims to reveal the multi-dimensional understanding of "reality" embedded in different artistic forms. This inter-media comparison not only expands the formal boundaries of philosophical inquiry but also highlights the irreplaceable role of images and symbols in philosophical thinking.</p>

            <h2>The Body as a Philosophical Starting Point: Embodied Thinking in Cross-Cultural Comparison and Its Practical Applications</h2>
            <p>This article explores a research approach of "embodied comparative philosophy," focusing on the body as a central intersection of philosophy and reality. By comparing conceptions of the body in Chinese and Western philosophical traditions — such as the Chinese holistic view of "body–mind–Dao" and the Western philosophical shift from Descartes to phenomenology — this article uncovers the multiple philosophical meanings of the body in cognition, emotion, and ethics. It further examines how the idea of "integration of mind and body" is theoretically developed and practically manifested across different cultural contexts. Based on this, it analyzes how this embodied philosophical model can provide new conceptual frameworks and actionable pathways for contemporary issues in mental health, education, and technological ethics, highlighting the transformative power and humanistic concern of comparative philosophy in real-world applications.</p>

            <h2>Toward a Shared Future: Cross-Cultural Philosophical Dialogue and Responsive Approaches in a Global Context</h2>
            <p>This article proposes a "future-oriented comparative philosophy" paradigm, using global challenges — such as climate change, AI ethics, and social justice — as a starting point to facilitate creative integration and cross-cultural dialogue among philosophical traditions. Unlike traditional comparative philosophy, which often focuses on retrospective textual analysis, this article emphasizes a problem-driven, forward-looking, and constructive approach to philosophical comparison. By integrating the Chinese ideas of "harmony between humans and nature" and "unity through diversity" with Western traditions of Enlightenment rationality and democratic ethics, this article attempts to develop a cross-cultural, sustainable, and inclusive global ethical framework. It aims to provide theoretical support and intellectual resources for the vision of a shared human future and to highlight the public value and action potential of comparative philosophy in the new era.</p>
