            <h2>New Models and Opportunities in Agricultural Urbanization: Exploring Digital Villages, De-Urbanization, and Urban-Rural Integration</h2>
            <p>In recent years, with the rapid development of digital technology and the deepening implementation of the national rural revitalization strategy, agricultural urbanization is undergoing a profound transformation. Digital villages, de-urbanization, and urban-rural integration have become key buzzwords in this transformation, reshaping traditional agricultural and urban development models, and providing new opportunities and pathways for rural revitalization and new-type urbanization construction.</p>

            <h3>I. Digital Villages: The Path to Integration of Smart Agriculture and Urbanization</h3>
            <p>The construction of digital villages is an important tool to promote the modernization of agriculture and rural areas, and it is also an inevitable choice for the deep integration of smart agriculture and urbanization. Traditional agricultural development faces constraints such as tightening resource and environmental pressures, low production efficiency, and information asymmetry in the market. Although urbanization has released rural development vitality, it has also exacerbated the urban-rural dual structure. The introduction of digital technology provides new ideas for solving these problems.</p>
            <h4>1. Smart Agriculture: Digital Technology Empowering Agricultural Modernization</h4>
            <p>Smart agriculture relies on digital technologies such as the Internet of Things, big data, and artificial intelligence to achieve precise and intelligent management of the entire agricultural production process. This not only improves agricultural production efficiency and reduces production costs but also enhances the quality and competitiveness of agricultural products. Through the application of digital technology, traditional agriculture is gradually transforming towards intensification and intelligence, injecting new vitality into agricultural modernization.</p>
            <h4>2. Urbanization: The Bridge for Urban-Rural Integration</h4>
            <p>Urbanization is an inevitable path to modernization and an important way to solve the "three rural issues." Through urbanization, rural population shifts to urban areas, promoting land circulation and scale operations, and releasing rural development vitality. At the same time, urbanization advances the equal exchange of urban and rural elements and the balanced allocation of public resources, laying the foundation for urban-rural integration.</p>
            <h4>3. Digital Villages: The Integration Platform for Smart Agriculture and Urbanization</h4>
            <p>Digital village construction, supported by digital technology, breaks down urban-rural barriers and promotes the free flow of talents, funds, and technology between urban and rural areas. By building an ecosystem of "digital + agriculture" and "digital + urban," digital villages provide a platform and carrier for the integrated development of smart agriculture and urbanization, driving comprehensive rural revitalization.</p>

            <h3>II. De-Urbanization: A Revolutionary Population Migration Reconfiguring Urban-Rural Relations</h3>
            <p>In recent years, the wave of returning to rural entrepreneurship has swept across the country, and the phenomenon of "de-urbanization" has gradually attracted attention. However, de-urbanization is not a simple "return flow" but a profound population migration revolution. It breaks the traditional "rural-urban" one-way flow model, forming a more diverse and three-dimensional new pattern of urban-rural interaction.</p>
            <h4>1. The Deep Logic of De-Urbanization</h4>
            <p>De-urbanization refers to the return of urban population to rural areas, not just a reverse movement in the urbanization process, but an inevitable trend as economic and social development reaches a certain stage. Returnees bring capital, technology, and experience back to their hometowns, combining with local resources, culture, and ecology to create new economic growth points. Data shows that over the past decade, the number of returnees starting businesses in China has exceeded ten million,带动就业 over thirty million people, and has become an important force driving rural revitalization.</p>
            <h4>2. Opportunities and Challenges Coexist</h4>
            <p>Behind the wave of de-urbanization, there are the release of policy dividends, the growth of market demand, and the empowerment of technological progress, but also challenges such as resource constraints, insufficient risk awareness, and cultural conflicts. To better promote de-urbanization, the government needs to further improve infrastructure; society needs to strengthen support for returnees; and returnees themselves need to conduct market research, formulate feasible business plans, and enhance their capabilities.</p>

            <h3>III. Urban-Rural Integration: A Silent Revolution Reconfiguring the Relationship Between People and Land</h3>
            <p>The urban-rural relationship is an important topic in the development of human civilization, and urban-rural integration is the inevitable choice to transcend the traditional dualistic opposition. The traditional urban-rural dual structure divides cities and villages into two opposing systems, leading to the widening gap between urban and rural development and the waste of resources. Urban-rural integration means breaking this opposition and building a new relationship of mutual complementarity and coordinated development.</p>
            <h4>1. The Deep Logic of Urban-Rural Integration</h4>
            <p>The essence of urban-rural integration is a silent revolution reconfiguring the relationship between people and land. In the traditional urban-rural dual structure, people's dependence on land is mainly manifested in the material level, with people being bound to the land and becoming an attachment to it. Urban-rural integration means people being liberated from the attachment to land, becoming the true masters of the land. Through urban-rural integration, people can freely choose their place of residence and workplace, and land is no longer merely a production factor but a spatial carrier for human life.</p>
            <h4>2. The Sustainable Development Path of New-Type Urbanization</h4>
            <p>The traditional urbanization model, with economic growth as the primary goal, has led to excessive pressure on resources and the environment and increasingly prominent urban issues. New-type urbanization must adhere to people-centered development, following an intensive, intelligent, green, and low-carbon path. In urban development, emphasis should be placed on intrinsic development, enhancing urban quality and livability; in rural development, priority should be given to ecology, developing featured industries, and building beautiful villages.</p>
            <h4>3. Future Challenges of Urban-Rural Integration</h4>
            <p>Urban-rural integration is a complex systematic project, facing challenges such as how to remove institutional and systemic barriers to the flow of urban and rural elements, achieve equalization of basic public services, and protect rural character. The government, market, and society need to collaborate and jointly explore new paths for urban-rural integration.</p>

            <h3>IV. Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Digital villages, de-urbanization, and urban-rural integration are new models and opportunities for the development of agricultural urbanization. The construction of digital villages provides a platform for the deep integration of smart agriculture and urbanization; the wave of de-urbanization reshapes urban-rural relations and stimulates rural vitality; and urban-rural integration provides a pathway for constructing a new urbanization paradigm and achieving common prosperity. In this profound transformation, we need to seize the opportunities of the digital economy development, explore a sustainable rural revitalization path with Chinese characteristics, and contribute to the comprehensive construction of a modern socialist country.</p>
