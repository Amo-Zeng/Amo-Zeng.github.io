            <h2>I. Phenomenon: Credit Transformed from Moral Commitment to Computable Capital</h2>
            <p>Traditional credit, rooted in the moral evaluations and personal guarantees of close-knit communities, is a form of "personalized credit" built upon long-term interactions, reputation accumulation, and relational networks. It is slow, subjective, embodied — yet it underpins the ethical foundation of social cooperation. However, digital technology has fundamentally restructured the logic of credit generation. Credit is evolving from a <strong>moral commitment</strong> into a <strong>computable, tradable, and predictable form of cognitive capital</strong>.</p>
            <p>In the platform economy, credit no longer relies on neighborhood reputation or bank credit records, but is instead generated in real time by algorithms that collect behavioral traces from users across payment, social, mobility, and consumption scenarios. Machine learning models then produce "credit scores" or "behavioral profiles." Systems like Sesame Credit, WeChat Pay Score, JD Baitiao, and Meituan Ratings have transformed credit from a "social evaluation" into a "data asset," and from "personal guarantee" into a quantified metric of "predictability of behavior." Credit has become an <strong>algorithmically intermediated tool</strong> for platforms to govern users, optimize services, and enable precision marketing.</p>
            <p>The essence of this transformation is the <strong>commodification and algorithmicization of credit</strong>: credit is no longer bestowed by social relationships, but defined by platform algorithms; it no longer reflects moral values, but data compliance. User behavior is continuously monitored, categorized, and scored. Credit has become an output of "digital labor" — every click, every履约 (fulfillment), every silence either "recharges" or "devalues" one's credit account. Credit has shifted from "Am I trustworthy?" to "Am I predictable?"</p>

            <h2>II. Mechanism: Algorithmic Intermediation and the Triple Alienation of Credit Production</h2>
            <p>The algorithmicization of credit is not merely a technological replacement, but a <strong>deep structural reconfiguration of the production mechanism</strong>. At its core is "algorithmic intermediation" — credit no longer emerges organically through social interaction, but is instead <strong>collected, modeled, evaluated, and allocated</strong> by platform algorithms as a third-party intermediary. This process leads to three forms of alienation:</p>

            <h3>1. Alienation of Subjectivity</h3>
            <p>Traditional credit is "social capital" actively constructed by individuals within relationships. Algorithmic credit, however, is passively generated as "data surplus." Users are no longer the builders of credit, but objects being "reverse-modeled" by algorithms. Credit becomes the product of the "gaze of the Other," dissolving the user's subjectivity under the gaze of data.</p>

            <h3>2. Alienation of Value</h3>
            <p>Credit, once a carrier of moral value, is now reduced to a <strong>lubricant for transactions and a tool of governance</strong> in the platform economy. High-credit users enjoy lower interest rates, faster services, and greater access — credit becomes a "privilege passport." Low-credit users are systematically "downgraded," even excluded from services, creating "digital credit exclusion." Credit no longer reflects "virtue," but "compliance" and "predictability."</p>

            <h3>3. Alienation of Power</h3>
            <p>Platforms, through data monopolies and algorithmic black boxes, monopolize the rights to define, evaluate, and distribute credit. Users cannot access the logic behind their scores, nor appeal or correct them — resulting in "algorithmic despotism." Credit sovereignty is transferred from individuals to platforms, creating a form of <strong>trust outsourcing</strong> — society no longer relies on interpersonal trust, but on the "technical credibility" of platform algorithms.</p>

            <p>The essence of this mechanism is the centralization of <strong>cognitive capital</strong>: platforms, via algorithmic intermediation, transform dispersed social credit resources into quantifiable, controllable, and monetizable digital assets, thereby constructing a data-centric credit power structure.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>III. Crisis: Systemic Risks in the Credit System</h2>
            <p>When credit is fully algorithmized, systemic risks emerge. The core contradiction lies in: <strong>algorithms seek efficiency and predictability, while social trust depends on diversity and uncertainty</strong>.</p>

            <h3>1. Algorithmic Bias and Credit Discrimination</h3>
            <p>Algorithmic models are trained on historical data, which may contain structural biases (e.g., regional, gender, or income discrimination). Thus, algorithmic credit systems may reproduce or even amplify social inequality. For example, low-income individuals may receive low credit scores due to lack of consumption data, making it harder to access credit — trapping them in a "credit poverty trap." Algorithms, though appearing neutral, become <strong>automated enforcers of systemic exclusion</strong>.</p>

            <h3>2. Credit Inflation and Value Dilution</h3>
            <p>To attract users, platforms widely adopt "credit easing" — rewarding every履约 with points, every purchase with bonuses, leading to inflated credit scores. Credit, once a scarce capital, becomes an "inflated digital points system," weakening its function as a social screening mechanism. When credit scores from 550 to 850 are all labeled "good," credit loses its signaling value.</p>

            <h3>3. Algorithmic Black Boxes and Lack of Accountability</h3>
            <p>Credit scoring processes lack transparency and explainability. Users cannot understand why their scores dropped, nor can they appeal. When credit determines loans, housing, employment, or even public services, this "inexplicable judgment" constitutes a real deprivation of individual rights. The credit system regresses from a "negotiable social contract" to an "unchallengeable technical verdict."</p>

            <h3>4. Credit Fragmentation and Data Silos</h3>
            <p>Each platform builds its own isolated credit system, creating "credit fragmentation." A high-credit user on Platform A may be "credit-invisible" on Platform B, preventing cross-platform credit mobility and reducing overall social credit efficiency. Worse, platforms may exploit credit scores for <strong>cross-market arbitrage</strong> — using high payment-credit to justify excessive financial lending, creating systemic financial risks.</p>

            <p>Together, these crises point to a deeper paradox: <strong>we use technology to pursue a more "objective" credit, yet in the process of algorithmic intermediation, we lose control, understanding, and moral responsibility over credit</strong>.</p>

            <h2>IV. Reflection: The Triple Rupture in Credit Civilization</h2>
            <p>The algorithmicization of credit reveals three ruptures in the development of digital civilization:</p>

            <h3>1. Rupture Between Technological Rationality and Value Rationality</h3>
            <p>Algorithmic credit prioritizes "computability" and "predictability," neglecting the <strong>ethical dimension</strong> of credit as social trust. Credit is not just "whether one will履约," but "why one chooses to履约" — is it from moral consciousness, or algorithmic incentive? When credit is entirely driven by external incentives, the internal foundation of social trust is hollowed out.</p>

            <h3>2. Rupture Between Individual Rights and Platform Power</h3>
            <p>Users surrender data for convenience, only to become "evaluated objects" in the credit system. Platforms, through data monopolies, establish "credit hegemony" — defining credit standards, controlling credit distribution, and determining credit consequences. Individuals lose credit sovereignty in the process of "trust outsourcing," falling into a state of "data dependency."</p>

            <h3>3. Rupture Between Local Efficiency and Holistic Civilization</h3>
            <p>Platform credit systems enhance local transactional efficiency but may weaken the overall social trust ecosystem. When credit is reduced to "predictability of behavior," society loses tolerance for "unpredictable goodness" (e.g., altruism, innovation, risk-taking). The more "precise" the credit system, the more "rigid" society becomes — we select the most "compliant," but may exclude the most "creative."</p>

            <p>These three ruptures reveal a fundamental issue: <strong>if digital civilization cannot rebuild the humanistic foundation of credit, the more advanced the technology, the more fragile the society</strong>.</p>

            <h2>V. Vision: Toward a Conscious Reconstruction of Credit Civilization</h2>
            <p>The credit crisis is, at its core, a civilizational crisis. We stand at the threshold of a transition from "industrial civilization" to "digital civilization," and credit is the central nexus of this leap. Digital civilization cannot be driven solely by algorithms and data — it requires a <strong>conscious construction of credit civilization</strong>: beyond technical efficiency, we must rebuild credit’s ethics, rights, and publicness.</p>

            <h3>1. Reclaim Credit Sovereignty: Achieve "Credit Decentralization"</h3>
            <p>Credit should not be monopolized by platforms, but co-constructed by multiple stakeholders. We can explore a "credit federation" model: establish cross-platform data-sharing mechanisms, with independent third parties (e.g., credit alliances, public credit platforms) conducting credit assessments, ensuring algorithmic transparency, auditability, and appealability. Users should have <strong>data portability and deletion rights</strong>, shifting from "trust outsourcing" to "credit autonomy."</p>

            <h3>2. Build a Framework of "Algorithmic Justice": Ensure Explainability and Fairness</h3>
            <p>Promote the use of "explainable AI" in credit assessment, requiring algorithms to provide scoring rationale and correction mechanisms. Establish an <strong>ethical review system for credit algorithms</strong>, banning discriminatory modeling based on sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender). Introduce "counterfactual fairness" testing to prevent the reproduction of historical biases.</p>

            <h3>3. Develop Complementary Mechanisms: "Social Credit" and "Algorithmic Credit"</h3>
            <p>Algorithmic credit excels at processing high-frequency, structured data, while social credit (e.g., community evaluations, professional reputation, public service records) captures non-quantifiable, contextual trust signals. We should build a "dual-track credit system": algorithmic credit for efficiency-driven transactions, social credit for value-driven social participation — mutually verifying to prevent credit homogenization.</p>

            <h3>4. Foster Philosophical Consciousness of "Credit Civilization"</h3>
            <p>Credit is not merely a technical issue, but a civilizational one. In digital civilization, credit should be treated as a <strong>public good</strong> — not just personal capital, but the infrastructure of social cooperation. We must re-examine: Should credit carry "moral weight"? Should we protect "non-utilitarian trust" (e.g., kindness to strangers)? Should we develop a philosophical framework for "credit ethics"?</p>

            <p>The essence of credit civilization is <strong>rebuilding the human foundation of trust in the digital world</strong>. It is not a rejection of algorithms, but a transcendence of technology — preserving humanity’s warmth, moral dignity, and social resilience beyond efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Credit Civilization as a Core Dimension of Digital Civilization</h2>
            <p>Credit is the glue of civilization. From "kinship credit" in tribal societies, to "contractual credit" in agrarian civilizations, to "institutional credit" in industrial civilizations, each evolution of credit marks an upgrade in human cooperation. Now, we are entering a new paradigm of <strong>digital credit</strong> — but this must not become algorithmic hegemony; it must be civilizational consciousness.</p>
            <p>True credit civilization does not turn everyone into a "predictable compliant actor," but enables each individual in the digital world to <strong>be trusted, and to trust others</strong>. It demands that we transcend "technological determinism" and rebuild human subjectivity within algorithmic intermediation; transcend "efficiency supremacy" by embedding moral considerations in credit evaluation; transcend "platform monopolies" by defending public value in data power.</p>
            <p>The ultimate vision of credit civilization is to build a <strong>trustworthy digital society</strong>: where algorithms are not black boxes, but transparent tools; where credit is not privilege, but shared rights; where trust is not outsourced, but autonomously constructed. This is not merely an optimization of governance, but the <strong>guardianship of human dignity</strong> in the digital age.</p>
            <p>In the long river of digital civilization, credit is no longer just about "whether one will履约," but the philosophical question of "why we trust." Only when credit returns to its humanistic roots will digital civilization truly mature — not "smarter," but more "trustworthy."</p>
            <blockquote><strong>Credit will ultimately not be a product of algorithms, but a crystallization of civilization.</strong></blockquote>
