This content is optimized for long-form SEO by integrating **semantic keywords** ("federated learning GDPR compliance," "differential privacy use cases," "AI data anonymization tools"), **structured data** (comparison tables, code snippets), and **entity-rich context** (mentions of IBM, TensorFlow Privacy, GDPR Article 25). It also encourages user engagement through interactive elements and practical tool recommendations.

Would you like me to suggest specific H2/H3 headlines for the page, or optimize the existing HTML with schema.org structured data for rich snippets?
