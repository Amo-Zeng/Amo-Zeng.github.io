            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Film, as a unique cultural phenomenon, has a development history that is not only about technological iteration and narrative innovation but also a dual process of media convergence and regional flow. In the digital age, the ways of film production, distribution, viewing, and preservation have undergone profound changes. These changes not only reshape the form of film but also provide a new perspective for its historical research. The interaction between film and other media technologies, as well as the fluidity and interactivity of regional film cultures, jointly constitute the multi-dimensional aspects of film history research. This article, through the combination of "Film Archaeology in the Digital Age," "Media Archaeology in Film," and "The 'Fluid Perspective' of Regional Film History," explores how film in the digital age forms a more dynamic and diverse film ecosystem through the dual perspectives of media convergence and regional flow.</p>

            <h3>Film Archaeology in the Digital Age: Technological Reshaping and Cultural Redefinition</h3>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technology, especially the application of digital effects, CGI (computer-generated imagery), and virtual reality, has profoundly changed the aesthetics and narrative forms of film. Traditional film relies on real-scene shooting and physical effects, while digital technology enables filmmakers to create more realistic and complex visual effects.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Reshaping of Film Aesthetics and Narrative by Digital Technology:</strong> Taking "Avatar" as an example, through advanced CGI technology, director James Cameron constructed a completely virtual Pandora planet, not only enhancing visual experience but also expanding narrative possibilities.</li>
                <li><strong>The Rise of Streaming Platforms and the Transformation of Film Distribution Models:</strong> The rise of streaming platforms has had a revolutionary impact on film distribution and audience viewing habits.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital File Formats and Challenges in Preserving Film Cultural Heritage:</strong> The advancement of digital technology provides new possibilities for film preservation but also brings new challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Film Dissemination and Recreative Phenomena on Online Platforms:</strong> User-generated content (UGC) and remix culture allow films to be reinterpreted and disseminated in the online space.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Media Archaeology in Film: Media Convergence and Narrative Innovation</h3>
            <p>As a medium, the development history of film is closely linked with other art forms such as photography, painting, and theater.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Interaction Between Film and Other Art Forms:</strong> By studying the relationship between these art forms and film, we can reveal how film has drawn nutrients from other art forms to form its unique medium attributes.</li>
                <li><strong>The Development History of Film Projection Technologies:</strong> Film, as the main carrier, has experienced the evolution from black and white to color, from silent to sound.</li>
                <li><strong>The Competition and Convergence of Film with Other Media Technologies:</strong> The competition and convergence of film with other media such as radio, television, and the internet further reveal the media complexity of film.</li>
                <li><strong>The Impact of Different Media Technologies on Film Narrative Forms:</strong> The sound narrative of radio, the multi-screen narrative of television, and the interactive narrative of the internet have all had a profound impact on film narrative forms.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The "Fluid Perspective" of Regional Film History: Cross-Border Cooperation and Cultural Exchange</h3>
            <p>Case studies of cross-border film production, distribution, and co-production are important entry points for understanding the fluidity of regional film history.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Case Studies of Cross-Border Film Production and Co-Production:</strong> With the development of globalization, film production has gradually broken through national boundaries, forming a mode of cross-border cooperation.</li>
            </ul>
