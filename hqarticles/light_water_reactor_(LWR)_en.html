            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Against the backdrop of global energy transition, nuclear energy, as an efficient and low-carbon energy source, is undergoing a profound transformation from traditional technologies to advanced technologies. Light Water Reactors (LWRs), as the mainstay of modern nuclear power, have demonstrated their reliability and economic efficiency over the past decades. However, with the continuous growth in global energy demand and the urgent need for low-carbon emissions, the nuclear industry is actively exploring safer and more efficient advanced reactor technologies. At the same time, the rapid development of AI-generated images has not only changed the way we acquire and interpret information but also brought new challenges and opportunities for public perception of nuclear energy technologies. This article will start with a technical comparison between light water reactors and advanced reactors, delve into the future development path of nuclear energy technology, and analyze the impact of the cognitive revolution triggered by AI-generated images on public acceptance of nuclear energy.</p>

            <h3>Technical Comparison Between Light Water Reactors and Advanced Reactors</h3>
            <h4>1. Differences in Basic Principles and Technical Architecture</h4>
            <p>Light water reactors mainly include Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) and Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs). Their core characteristics are the use of ordinary water as both a coolant and a moderator, fuel as low-enriched uranium, high operating pressure, and complex structures. Although this design has proven its reliability in past practices, it also exposes certain safety risks.</p>
            <p>In contrast, advanced reactors are diverse, such as Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors (HTGRs), Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), etc. These advanced reactors adopt a more diversified range of coolants and moderators, and fuel types are also more abundant. The design concept of these advanced reactors focuses more on simplifying structures and reducing operating pressure to enhance inherent safety. For example, high-temperature gas-cooled reactors use helium as a coolant, capable of stable operation at high temperatures, while molten salt reactors use molten salt as a coolant, offering higher fuel utilization and lower nuclear waste production.</p>
            <h4>2. Comparison of Performance Indicators</h4>
            <p><strong>Safety</strong>: Although light water reactors have demonstrated high reliability over the past decades, severe accidents in history (such as Chernobyl and Fukushima) have exposed their vulnerability under extreme conditions. Advanced reactors incorporate higher inherent safety standards from the outset, such as achieving automatic shutdown through natural physical processes, ensuring safety even in the event of a complete loss of external power.</p>
            <p><strong>Economy</strong>: Due to their mature technology, light water reactors have relatively low construction costs, but their lower fuel utilization rates lead to higher nuclear waste production. Although advanced reactors have higher initial construction costs, their higher fuel utilization rates and lower nuclear waste production make them more economically advantageous in the long term. Additionally, the modular design of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) not only shortens the construction period but also allows for flexible deployment based on demand, further enhancing economic benefits.</p>
            <p><strong>Sustainability</strong>: Light water reactors perform poorly in uranium resource utilization, generating nuclear waste with high radioactivity, which is challenging to handle and dispose of. Advanced reactors significantly improve uranium resource utilization efficiency through more efficient fuel cycles and lower nuclear waste production, providing new possibilities for the sustainable development of nuclear energy.</p>

            <h3>Sustainability and Challenges of Light Water Reactors</h3>
            <p>Although light water reactors have demonstrated efficient, low-carbon, and stable advantages in energy supply, the challenges they face cannot be ignored. First, the treatment and disposal of nuclear waste remain major global issues in the nuclear industry. Second, nuclear proliferation risks and environmental impact assessments require stricter regulation and control. To fully leverage the positive role of light water reactors in the sustainable energy system, it is essential to promote the development of safer and more efficient reactor technologies through technological innovation and policy support. Additionally, research into nuclear waste treatment and disposal technologies should be strengthened, and collaborative development with other clean energy technologies should be promoted. Furthermore, enhancing public communication and science education to improve public awareness and acceptance of nuclear energy is crucial for ensuring its sustainable development.</p>

            <h3>Public Perception Challenges and Solutions</h3>
            <p>In the wave of AI-generated images, the challenges of public perception are becoming increasingly prominent. AI-generated images, with their realism and diversity, challenge our standards of "truth," and the traditional concept of truth is undergoing deconstruction and reconstruction. This cognitive revolution not only changes the way we acquire information but also has a profound impact on public acceptance of complex technologies like nuclear energy.</p>
            <p>First, the widespread dissemination of AI-generated images may exacerbate public misunderstandings about nuclear energy. For example, false images of nuclear accidents or exaggerated descriptions of environmental impacts may lead to unnecessary panic and weaken public trust in nuclear energy. Second, the efficiency and convenience of AI technology make verification of information more difficult. When faced with complex technical issues, the public may rely more on superficial visual information rather than in-depth technical analysis and scientific arguments.</p>
            <p>To address this challenge, we need to adopt multi-faceted strategies. First, enhancing public visual literacy and critical cognitive abilities can help them better distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Second, establishing new information verification mechanisms ensures that the public can access accurate and reliable information. Additionally, the nuclear industry needs to strengthen communication with the public, enhancing understanding and trust in nuclear energy technology through transparent information disclosure and easy-to-understand science education.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Both light water reactors and advanced reactors have their own advantages and disadvantages, and their technical routes are complementary rather than对立. Light water reactors, with their mature technology and wide application base, will continue to play an important role in future nuclear power development. Advanced reactors represent the future direction of nuclear energy technology. With continuous technological progress and policy support, advanced reactors are expected to gradually achieve commercialization, providing safer, more efficient, and low-carbon energy choices for humanity.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the cognitive revolution triggered by AI-generated images brings new challenges and opportunities for nuclear energy development. Public perception and acceptance of nuclear energy will significantly influence its future development. By strengthening public communication and science education and enhancing public visual literacy and critical cognitive habits, we can create a favorable social environment for nuclear energy development, promote the safe, reliable, and sustainable utilization of nuclear energy technology, and make greater contributions to building a clean, low-carbon, safe, and efficient energy system.</p>
