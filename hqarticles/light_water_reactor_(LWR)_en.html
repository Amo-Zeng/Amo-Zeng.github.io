            <h2>2. Energy Security</h2>
            <h3>2.1 China's Energy Structure and Challenges</h3>
            <p>China is one of the world's largest energy consumers, with a long-term energy structure dominated by coal, supplemented by oil, natural gas, and renewable energy. Although this energy mix has supported rapid economic development, it has also led to severe environmental pollution, particularly air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, China has a high dependence on imported oil and natural gas, posing potential risks to energy supply stability. While renewable energy is developing rapidly, there are still limitations in terms of technology and large-scale utilization.</p>
            <h3>2.2 The Importance of Energy Security</h3>
            <p>Energy security is a crucial component of national security, directly affecting economic stability and social development. In China's energy transition, ensuring the stability and diversity of energy supply, reducing dependence on external sources, and minimizing environmental pollution are pressing issues. In this context, nuclear energy, as a clean and efficient energy source, is gaining attention. LWRs, as one of the mainstream technologies for nuclear power generation, have unique technical advantages and are becoming an important choice for China's energy security and structural transformation.</p>
            <h3>2.3 Technical Advantages of Light Water Reactors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Safety</strong>: LWRs use light water as both a coolant and moderator, offering high thermal efficiency and effective control of reactor heat output under normal operating conditions. Modern LWR designs incorporate multiple safety systems, such as automatic shutdown devices and passive cooling systems, ensuring safe operation even in extreme situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Economy</strong>: The construction and operating costs of LWRs are relatively low, with high fuel efficiency and power generation efficiency. Compared to coal-fired power plants, nuclear power plants have lower operational costs and provide stable power output over long periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Friendliness</strong>: LWRs produce almost no CO2, SOx, or NOx during operation, significantly reducing air pollution and greenhouse effects. Unlike renewable energy, LWRs are not affected by weather or seasonal changes, providing stable base-load electricity support.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.4 Current Development of Light Water Reactors in China</h3>
            <p>Currently, China is one of the fastest-growing countries in nuclear power development. LWRs, as the mainstream nuclear technology, are widely applied in China. As of 2023, LWRs account for the majority of China's operational nuclear power units, primarily located in the eastern coastal regions. These nuclear power plants not only provide stable electricity support for local economic development but also reduce the use of fossil fuels and dependence on imported oil and natural gas. In terms of construction, China is accelerating the development of new-generation LWRs, such as the "Hualong One" and "Guohe One," which feature advanced designs, higher safety and economic performance, and are expected to be operational in the coming years.</p>
            <h3>2.5 Role of Light Water Reactors in China's Energy Transition</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Replacement of Fossil Fuels</strong>: LWRs can reduce the use of coal, oil, and natural gas, becoming an essential means of reducing carbon emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Promotion of Renewable Energy Integration</strong>: With stable power generation capabilities, LWRs can act as "regulators" for the grid, providing stable electricity output when renewable energy is insufficient, thereby enhancing overall grid reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement of Energy System Stability</strong>: As a base-load power source, nuclear power ensures stable electricity supply during extreme weather or emergencies, which is crucial for national energy security and maintaining normal economic and social operations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.6 Future Outlook</h3>
            <p>In the future, LWRs will play an even more significant role in China's energy security strategy. To further promote this technology, the following policy recommendations are particularly important:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increase R&D Investment</strong>: Strengthen investment in nuclear energy technology research, particularly in improving reactor safety, economy, and sustainability.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhance Industry Chain</strong>: Ensure the sustainable development of the nuclear power industry, increase the localization rate of key components, and reduce reliance on external supply chains.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthen International Cooperation</strong>: Actively participate in global nuclear energy cooperation and exchanges, learn from international advanced experiences, and promote technology sharing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Public Perception</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Current Public Perception of Light Water Reactors</h3>
            <p>Despite the widespread application of LWRs globally, public perception is often riddled with misconceptions and concerns. Many people are skeptical about the safety of nuclear energy, particularly due to the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear accidents, which have led to a general belief that nuclear power poses high risks and could cause severe environmental pollution and health hazards. Additionally, some view nuclear technology as complex and expensive, making it difficult to compete economically with traditional energy sources. Concerns about nuclear waste management are also prevalent, as the long-term storage and disposal of nuclear waste remain unresolved. These misconceptions and concerns have led to low public support for LWRs, and in some regions, anti-nuclear sentiment has emerged.</p>
            <h3>3.2 Safety of Light Water Reactors</h3>
            <p>LWRs are designed and operated with high safety standards. Modern LWRs include multiple safety systems, such as reactor cooling systems, automatic shutdown systems, and emergency cooling systems, ensuring reactor safety under various extreme conditions. Moreover, the operational record of LWRs demonstrates their safety. According to data from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), LWRs operating globally have maintained a high safety record over the past decades, with a very low incidence of nuclear accidents.</p>
            <h3>3.3 Benefits of Light Water Reactors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Economic Benefits</strong>: LWRs have relatively low power generation costs, with stable long-term operational costs, offering significant economic benefits.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Benefits</strong>: LWRs have a significant advantage in reducing carbon emissions, making them an important tool in global climate change mitigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Benefits</strong>: The construction and operation of LWRs provide substantial employment opportunities and reliable power support for industries, healthcare, education, and other sectors.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.4 Ways to Improve Public Perception</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strengthen Public Education</strong>: Use various channels such as media, the internet, and offline activities to disseminate accurate and scientific information about nuclear energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Promote Public Participation</strong>: Actively listen to public opinions during the planning and construction of nuclear energy projects, engaging in open and transparent discussions.</li>
