            <h3>The Future of Haptic Feedback: Immersive Evolution of Touchscreen Technology</h3>
            <p>Haptic feedback technology, particularly ultrasonic haptic feedback, micro-vibration technology, and electrical stimulation technology, is revolutionizing user interaction experiences.</p>
            <h4>Ultrasonic Haptic Feedback</h4>
            <p>Ultrasonic haptic feedback uses ultrasonic energy to create tactile experiences without any physical contact. By controlling the frequency, intensity, and distribution of ultrasound, devices can produce different tactile sensations on the user's fingers or other contact areas. This technology not only enhances the realism of touch but also provides a more immersive interaction for users. For example, in Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), users can feel different textures when touching virtual objects, thereby increasing immersion.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use Cases</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Virtual Fitting: Users can touch clothing in a virtual environment to feel its texture and thickness.</li>
                        <li>Game Interaction: Different weapons in games can be represented through different vibration patterns, giving players a real shooting feedback.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Micro-Vibration Technology</h4>
            <p>Micro-vibration technology involves embedding tiny vibration motors within the touchscreen to provide real-time feedback to user touch operations. These micro-vibration motors can adjust their size and frequency of vibrations according to different application scenarios and user needs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use Cases</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Text Input: Each letter typed can come with a slight vibration, enhancing user confirmation.</li>
                        <li>Entertainment Experience: Touching different parts of a music player can trigger different vibration modes, adding depth to the music experience.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Electrical Stimulation Technology</h4>
            <p>Electrical stimulation technology involves embedding electrodes into touchscreens so that users can feel micro-current stimulation when touching, thereby producing haptic feedback. This technology can simulate various tactile sensations, including the texture of different surfaces, temperature, and force.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use Cases</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Medical Applications: Used for pain management, delivering pain-relieving electrical signals through touch.</li>
                        <li>Educational Tools: When learning anatomy, students can touch virtual organs on the screen to feel different textures, enhancing learning effects.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
