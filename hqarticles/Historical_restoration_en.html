            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>History, as the narration and interpretation of the past, constantly faces a fundamental temptation and dilemma: Is it possible to "reduce" or "restore" the true face of history? Traditional historiography views reduction as a process of asymptotically approaching truth through increasingly refined textual criticism and archaeological discoveries, with the ideal of purging subjective biases from narratives to present an objective historical truth. However, this approach is based on a naive mirror-reflection theory – presupposing that human cognition is a neutral lens, and historical facts are like external objects that can be directly observed and recorded.</p>
            <p>This article argues that contemporary historiography is undergoing a profound paradigm shift: historical reduction is no longer understood as a one-way effort to eliminate subjectivity to reach a purely objective彼岸(the other shore), but rather as a complex, multidimensional process of "polyphonic" construction. This process must simultaneously address three intertwined dimensions: <strong>the biological filter of historical cognition (neuroarchaeology)</strong>, <strong>the non-human sources of historical dynamics (the agency of things)</strong>, and <strong>the power structures of historical knowledge production (digital deconstruction)</strong>. This article attempts to organically integrate these three perspectives, reveal the intrinsic dialogues and tensions among them, and thereby propose a more critical and inclusive historical reductionism. This paradigm no longer pursues a single, authoritative "truth," but strives to reveal the deep mechanisms that shape "multiple truths," thus respecting and understanding the complexity of history at a more fundamental level.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>I. Foundation and Framework: Historical Narratives under Cognitive Templates</h2>
            <p>The neuroarchaeological perspective on historical cognition shifts the research focus from external historical facts to internal cognitive processing mechanisms. This perspective profoundly points out that the history we understand and transmit must first be filtered through the inherent cognitive structures and emotional patterns of the human brain. As relevant research reveals, cognitive templates evolved by the brain, such as the "hero narrative" and "victim narrative," function like preset narrative scripts, simplifying the chaotic flow of history into dramatic frameworks that are easy to remember and transmit. Emotional factors, especially the "flashbulb memory" mechanism triggered by trauma, act like a cognitive highlighter, solidifying specific events into the cornerstone of collective identity.</p>
            <p>Taking the memory formation of the Nanjing Massacre as an example, neuroarchaeology provides a powerful explanatory mechanism: its narrative emphasis on civilian suffering aligns with the cognitive template of the "victim narrative" and leverages the biological solidification effect of traumatic memory, thereby forming a strong cohesive force for national identity. However, the profundity of this perspective lies precisely in its critical core: it simultaneously reveals the cognitive "blind spots" that inevitably accompany such memory formation processes. Complex historical facts that do not fit the dominant emotional framework – such as the diversity of defending forces' strategies, differences in civilian responses, specific details of international rescue efforts, etc. – are often marginalized or even obscured at the cognitive level.</p>
            <p><strong>The first challenge facing historical reduction stems from our own biological limitations. What we reduce is not "history itself," but "history as encoded and permitted by the human cognitive system."</strong> Neuroarchaeology not only fundamentally questions any claim to absolute objectivity in historical narrative but also partially shifts the historian's task from "uncovering truth" to "reflecting on why we so desire and shape specific types of truth."</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>II. Expansion of the Network: Introducing Non-Human Actors into Historical Dynamics</h2>
            <p>If neuroarchaeology reveals the "internal limits" of historical cognition, then the perspective of the "agency of things" revolutionarily expands the "external network" of historical dynamics. This theory severely criticizes the anthropocentric paradigm of traditional historiography, proposing that non-human elements such as climate, viruses, crops, technology, and currency be regarded as active "actors." These elements, with their physical properties and existential logic, actively participate in, trigger, or even reverse historical processes.</p>
            <p>Using the case of the Ming Dynasty's collapse and silver flows, this perspective vividly demonstrates that the fate of the Ming was not determined solely by power struggles within the Forbidden City or peasant uprisings in the Central Plains, but was intricately intertwined with the output of distant American silver mines, the paths of global trade winds, and the fiscal policies of the Spanish Empire. Silver, as a "thing," with its tidal effects of global flow, directly impacted the fiscal foundation of the Ming Empire.</p>
            <p>This perspective demands a thorough "decentralizing" turn in historical reduction: <strong>History is no longer a solo performance by humans, but the interactive result of a "heterogeneous network" composed of both human and non-human actors.</strong> When attempting to reduce the truth of the Ming Dynasty's decline, the vision must expand from court memorials and imperial deliberations to Pacific shipping routes, Andean mountain mines, and even how the physical properties of silver as a metal shaped the global economic system.</p>
            <p>At this point, historical reduction presents a twofold dialogue: the <strong>internal world of cognition</strong> and the <strong>external network of actors</strong>. Neuroarchaeology explains why humans are accustomed to telling stories centered on "people" (because it fits cognitive templates), while the agency of things perspective reveals that the real dynamics of historical processes may far exceed human intentions. This constitutes the second challenge of historical reduction: historians must actively resist the simplifying temptation of cognitive templates and humbly enter the more complex, decentralized actor network.</p>

            <h2>III. The Encoding of Power: A New Critique of Historical Production in the Digital Age</h2>
            <p>However, whether reflecting on cognitive templates or tracing non-human actors, contemporary historical research increasingly relies on the digital space as a new arena. Historical data critique from a postcolonial perspective timely warns us that <strong>digital technology is not a neutral reduction tool; it is itself an encoding system imbued with a will to power.</strong> The process of historical "datafication" – encompassing archive selection, prioritization of digitization, metadata classification (such as tagging systems, spatiotemporal frameworks), etc. – is invariably embedded with specific cultural presuppositions and power discourses.</p>
            <p>The case of the World Historical Gazetteer (WHGazetteer) deeply reveals this. Annotating historically vague, pluralistic, culturally blended borderlands on digital maps using the form of precise modern national boundaries is not a "reduction" of history, but a "digital violence" inflicted upon historical space through the West-centric lens of the Westphalian system. The choice of romanization schemes for place names is a micropolitical struggle concerning writing rights and identity.</p>
            
            <h3>Threefold Dialogues</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Dialogue with Neuroarchaeology:</strong> Neuroarchaeology points out the biological cognitive biases of the brain, while digital critique reveals that digital tools are implanted with <strong>social and cultural biases</strong>. The former constitutes a biological "hard coding," the latter a "soft coding" of power structures. Together they form a dual filtering mechanism that profoundly influences the "historical facts" we encounter.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialogue with the Agency of Things:</strong> The agency of things perspective demands attention to the historical role of non-human actors (like silver, climate), while digital critique points out that <strong>digital infrastructure itself is also a powerful "non-human actor."</strong> The design logic and algorithmic rules of databases actively shape the problem consciousness, methods, and conclusions of historical research, participating in the construction of historical knowledge through technical "agency."</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Therefore, <strong>the third challenge of historical reduction arises precisely from the tools we rely on for reduction.</strong> We hope to use digital technology to transcend human cognitive limitations and more "objectively" grasp the complexity of material networks, yet we may unwittingly fall into new, more concealed traps of power/knowledge.</p>

            <h2>Synthesis and Theoretical Elevation: Towards a Critical Historical Polyphonic Reductionism</h2>
            <p>Based on the organic integration and dialogue of the three perspectives above, a new vision of historical reductionism can be outlined. This paradigm is no longer a unidirectional "approximation of truth," but a critical construction process unfolding within multiple composite structures. We call this <strong>"Critical Historical Polyphonic Reductionism."</strong></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Polyphony"</strong> signifies that historical truth is woven from multiple voices (human, non-human) and multiple forces (biological, material, technological), being essentially plural and non-singular.</li>
                <li><strong>"Critical"</strong> constitutes the methodological core of this reductionism. It requires historians to always maintain a threefold critical awareness:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Critique of the cognitive apparatus: Reflecting on how one's own cognitive templates and emotional patterns preset narrative forms.</li>
                        <li>Critique of the dynamic network: Breaking through anthropocentric narratives to actively explore the historical roles of non-human actors.</li>
                        <li>Critique of knowledge production tools: Deconstructing the political and power logic behind digital infrastructure,警惕(be vigilant against) new hegemonies beneath the appearance of "objective data."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The goal of <strong>"Reduction"</strong> thus undergoes a fundamental shift: It no longer pursues the "one correct" past, but is <strong>dedicated to reducing the complex mechanisms that shape historical narratives and historical processes.</strong> The true historical truth may well lie within the interactions of these mechanisms.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion and Outlook</h2>
            <p>The charm of history may precisely stem from its profundity of being impossible to be fully "reduced." The three perspectives of neuroarchaeology, the agency of things, and digital deconstruction do not offer three paths to the same endpoint, but together draw a more magnificent and yet more humble map of historical cognition. It shows that historical reduction is an endless exploration, whose value lies not in occupying the high ground of "truth," but in continuously revealing, through persistent exploration, the limitations of our own cognition, the depth of entanglement between humans and the material world, and the power structures latent in knowledge systems. Only through such critical, polyphonic exploration can historiography continue to fulfill its sacred mission of understanding the human condition and enlightening future wisdom.</p>
            
            <h3>Suggestions for Future Research Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Promote deep integration of interdisciplinary methods:</strong> Historians should actively engage in substantive collaboration with fields like cognitive neuroscience, environmental studies, computer science, and humanities theory to jointly design historical models capable of synchronously analyzing the evolution of collective emotional memory and interactions with natural environmental variables, breaking disciplinary barriers and achieving methodological innovation.</li>
                <li><strong>Develop digital tools with critical awareness:</strong> Digital humanities should not stop at technical application but strive to develop tool systems with self-reflective capabilities. For example, building historical GIS platforms that support multiple namings, fuzzy boundaries, and dynamic changes, enabling them to represent rather than erase historical complexity, responding to postcolonial concerns at the technical level.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthen the ethical and political responsibility of historical writing:</strong> Acknowledging the constructive nature of historical reduction means historians bear greater ethical responsibility. When dealing with collective traumatic memory, a careful balance between emotional resonance and historical complexity is needed; when using digital archives, priority should be given to the right of expression of marginalized groups; in global historical narratives, any form of centrism must be abandoned, sincerely embracing a pluralistic, equal, and symbiotic world historical vision.</li>
                <li><strong>Expand research dimensions of non-human actors:</strong> Future research needs to more systematically incorporate non-human factors such as climate change, species dissemination, and technological object life cycles into historical explanatory frameworks, developing branches like cross-species historiography and environmental historiography, meticulously analyzing how these actors interact with humans and jointly shape historical trajectories.</li>
                <li><strong>Deepen polyphonic awareness in public history education:</strong> History education should introduce the concept of polyphony, cultivating public understanding and respect for historical plurality. Through curriculum design, museum curation, and new media dissemination, the multiple facets and interpretative possibilities of history should be showcased, building a more inclusive community of historical memory.</li>
