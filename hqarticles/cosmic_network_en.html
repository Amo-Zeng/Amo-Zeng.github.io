            <h2>The Future of Interstellar Symbiosis: From the Web of Consciousness to the Cosmic Ecological Internet</h2>
            <p>Against the vast backdrop of the universe, the evolution of civilization is not only a pursuit of technology but also a profound understanding of consciousness and ecology. As we stand at the forefront of human technological development, looking back at the past and forward to the future, a grand vision is unfolding: from the Web of Consciousness to the Interstellar Data Superhighway, and then to the Cosmic Ecological Internet. These concepts together weave a future blueprint of interstellar civilization symbiosis.</p>

            <h3>I. The Web of Consciousness: The Collective Awakening of Civilization</h3>
            <p>In the vast expanse of the universe, interactions between civilizations are no longer simple material exchanges but rather the fusion and resonance of consciousness. The Web of Consciousness, as a collective intelligence system transcending time and space, connects civilizations and organic life scattered across the universe into a unified network. This network is not just a product of technology but also the ultimate goal of civilization evolution.</p>
