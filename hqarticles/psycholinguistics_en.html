            <h2>Language is Not Just a Communication Tool, but Also a Reflection of Thought, Emotion, and Culture</h2>
            <p>Language is not only a tool for human communication but also an external expression of thought, emotion, and culture. This article integrates research from psycholinguistics, neuroscience, and cross-cultural communication to explore how language functions in multiple dimensions such as neural plasticity, affective computing, and cross-cultural communication.</p>

            <h3>Language Acquisition and Neural Plasticity: Dynamic Rewiring of the Brain</h3>
            <p>Language acquisition relies on neural plasticity in the brain, primarily manifested in the formation and pruning of synapses. During the critical period of language acquisition, the brain forms complex neural circuits through extensive language input, supporting language generation and comprehension.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multilingual Environments:</strong> Children's brains enhance activity in the anterior insula and frontal lobes, forming a flexible language control system.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphasia Recovery:</strong> Functional reorganization and brain stimulation techniques promote neural network recovery.</li>
                <li><strong>Second Language Acquisition in Adults:</strong> Brain stimulation techniques optimize language processing capabilities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Language and Affective Computing: Core Medium for Emotional Expression and Decision-Making</h3>
            <p>Language is not only a tool for transmitting information but also a core medium for emotional expression and perception. The use of emotional vocabulary significantly impacts emotional states, and affective computing achieves emotional recognition and classification by analyzing language texts.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Emotional Vocabulary:</strong> Positive and negative words influence emotional states.</li>
                <li><strong>Metaphors and Tone:</strong> Enhance emotional expressiveness and perceptiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Decision-Making:</strong> Provide personalized emotional support through natural language processing technology.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Language and Cross-Cultural Communication: Dynamic Interaction of Cultural Identity</h3>
            <p>Language shapes and reflects individuals' cultural identity cognition in cross-cultural communication. Language patterns in different cultural contexts influence ways of thinking, values, and behavioral patterns.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bilingual and Multilingual Speakers:</strong> Language switching leads to dual cognitive and emotional changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Identity:</strong> Changes in language use may trigger shifts in cultural identity.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Cultural Communication:</strong> Language conveys cultural information, constructs social roles, and fosters group belonging.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion and Future Outlook</h3>
            <p>The multidimensional roles of language in neural plasticity, affective computing, and cross-cultural communication highlight its central position in human cognition, emotion, and cultural identity. Future research will further deepen language studies, promoting personalized language learning, emotional support, and global communication.</p>
