        <h2>The Triple Paradigm Shift of NAC: The Resilient Foundation of Digital Civilization</h2>

        <section>
            <p><strong>In the structural leap of digital civilization from "connectivity" to "trustworthiness," Network Access Control (NAC) is undergoing a quiet yet profound paradigm transformation—no longer merely a "gatekeeper" at the network perimeter, but evolving into <strong>three core infrastructures</strong> that sustain digital society: <strong>digital immune hub, sovereignty anchor point, and ecological governance node</strong>. This triple shift is not a mere technical superposition, but a multidimensional <strong>trust ecosystem</strong> constructed around the central civilizational question of "trusted presence," across technical, social, and ecological dimensions—marking NAC's elevation from a defensive tool to civilizational infrastructure.</strong></p>

            <h2>First Shift: Digital Immunity—An Adaptive Mechanism for Technical Trustworthiness</h2>
            <p>NAC builds "digital immune memory" through continuous learning of endpoint behavior, threat responses, and recovery pathways, achieving a paradigm shift from static rules to dynamic adaptation. Its logic stems from the <strong>memory, specificity, and plasticity of biological immune systems</strong>: the system not only detects known attacks, but also predicts novel threats via behavioral baseline modeling, forming cross-defensive capabilities akin to immunity. In cloud-native and edge computing environments, NAC embeds lightweight immune mechanisms into service chains and local nodes, enabling "service-level immunity" and "offline immunity." At its core, this reflects a shift in cybersecurity from a "perfect barrier" to "resilient adaptation"—as complex systems theory reveals: true security lies not in eliminating disturbances, but in <strong>maintaining functional continuity amid uncertainty</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Second Shift: Sovereignty Anchoring—The Institutionalization of Social Trust in the Digital Realm</h2>
            <p>As human activity migrates into metaverses, hybrid workspaces, and digital twins, the boundary between physical and virtual blurs, making NAC a mechanism for determining "trusted presence." By integrating device fingerprints, behavioral trustworthiness, and spatial context, NAC constructs dynamic trusted profiles that determine not only network access rights, but also the boundaries of virtual identities, resource allocation, and social participation eligibility. Limiting speech rights for anomalous endpoints in metaverse conferences, or ensuring authorization in industrial digital twins—this process is in essence the <strong>institutional reconstruction of digital sovereignty</strong>. NAC thus becomes a "constitution for trusted access," materializing and operationalizing Rousseau's social contract of "rights surrendered for order" in the digital dimension. No longer just a technical component, NAC emerges as a <strong>foundational governance architecture for digital society</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Third Shift: Ecological Governance—A Practical Carrier of Accountability and Responsibility</h2>
            <p>Under carbon neutrality goals and ESG frameworks, NAC transcends the boundaries of security and sovereignty to become an environmental governance "carbon nerve ending." By integrating lifecycle assessment (LCA) data and behavioral environmental psychology models, NAC constructs a "network carbon footprint profile," implementing "carbon-threshold access" and "dynamic carbon quotas," internalizing carbon emissions—once an "external cost"—as a condition for network access. For instance, restricting high-energy devices from connecting, triggering energy-saving strategies, and using behavioral feedback mechanisms to shift users from "passive compliance" to "green consciousness." This transformation marks a shift from "security-first" to "responsibility-first" in network management—<strong>every access decision becomes a digital fulfillment of ecological contracts</strong>, turning NAC into a sustainable governance node within urban digital ecosystems.</p>

            <h2>The Deep Unity of the Three Paradigms: Constructing Trusted Presence in Three Dimensions</h2>
            <p>These three shifts are not parallel but form a <strong>three-dimensional construction</strong> of "trusted presence" across technology, society, and ecology:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital Immunity</strong> ensures "behavioral trustworthiness" (technical trust),</li>
                <li><strong>Sovereignty Anchoring</strong> confirms "identity trustworthiness" (social trust),</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Governance</strong> realizes "responsibility trustworthiness" (ecological trust).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Together, they form the complete profile of a "trusted agent" in digital civilization—a digital existence that is secure, legitimate, and sustainable.</p>

            <h2>Future Outlook: NAC as a Technical-Ethical Infrastructure for Digital Civilizational Resilience</h2>
            <p>The ultimate significance of NAC lies in becoming a <strong>technical-ethical infrastructure for the resilience of digital civilization</strong>. In the future, it will deeply integrate with AI, edge intelligence, and carbon accounting standards to build a cross-organizational, cross-platform "trusted federation"—sharing immune memory, sovereignty standards, and carbon data to form a global trusted network ecosystem. In extreme scenarios, NAC can become a "digital lifeline" for disaster response: rapidly restoring trusted access during crises to ensure continuity of critical services like healthcare and energy, embodying <strong>the self-repairing capacity of digital civilization in moments of rupture</strong>.</p>
            <p>More importantly, NAC will drive the institutionalization of "technical-ethical infrastructure": it will not only enforce rules, but serve as a <strong>carrier for embedded values</strong>—encoding safety, fairness, and sustainability into access decisions. When NAC can defend against cyberattacks, anchor digital sovereignty, and fulfill ecological responsibilities, it transcends its instrumental nature to become a <strong>digital cornerstone</strong> that anchors truth, freedom, and sustainable futures amid the digital deluge.</p>
            <p>This is not merely technological evolution, but a marker of civilizational advancement: technology, at last, begins to bear the weight of civilization, constructing the <strong>resilient foundation of digital civilization</strong> amid digital uncertainty.</p>
