            <h2>Stratigraphy: Earth's History "Time Capsule"</h2>
            <p>Strata, like Earth's rings, stack upon each other, silently recording the vicissitudes of billions of years. Each layer of stratum is a silent epic, carrying the evolution of Earth and the origin and proliferation of life.</p>

            <h3>I. Strata: Earth's History "Time Capsule"</h3>
            <p>Stratigraphy constructs a complete geological time scale by studying the formation process, spatial-temporal distribution, and fossil records of sediments in the crust, opening a door to the past.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fossils:</strong> Fossils, the most fascinating part of strata, are messengers across time, conveying ancient biological forms, structures, and behaviors to us.</li>
                <li><strong>Geological Events:</strong> Each layer of stratum witnesses the evolution of Earth's life, recording geological events, climate changes, and biological evolution during specific periods.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>II. Stratigraphy: A Window into Current Environmental Changes</h3>
            <p>Stratigraphy is not only a discipline studying geological history but also a science revealing Earth's evolutionary laws. Through in-depth research, we can understand Earth's plate tectonics, volcanic eruptions, and climatic changes.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Analysis of Geological Events:</strong> By analyzing strata from the end of the Cretaceous period, scientists found evidence of the dinosaur extinction event and deduced that an asteroid impact might have caused dramatic environmental changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Modern Sediment Research:</strong> By studying modern sediments, scientists can understand current climate, environment, and geological activities, providing crucial information for future predictions.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>III. Stratigraphy: The Foundation for Building a Sustainable Future</h3>
            <p>Earth's resources are finite, while human needs are infinite. Achieving harmony between humans and nature is a major challenge. Stratigraphy provides valuable geological data and scientific methods, laying the foundation for a sustainable future.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>IV. The Future of Stratigraphy: Exploration and Preservation</h3>
            <p>In the future, with advances in technology, stratigraphy research will become more in-depth. We will be able to better interpret Earth's "time capsule," unravel more mysteries of Earth's history, and provide crucial scientific basis for sustainable development.</p>
