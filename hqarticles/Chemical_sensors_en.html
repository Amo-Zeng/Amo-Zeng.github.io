            <h3>The Synergistic Effect of Green Chemistry and Sensing Technology</h3>
            <p>The core of green chemistry is to reduce the generation and emission of harmful substances and promote eco-friendly materials and technologies. In this context, the innovative development of chemical sensors stands out. The use of green materials such as biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) and naturally sourced cellulose has revolutionized the construction methods of sensors. Additionally, self-powered designs, such as advanced photovoltaic and thermoelectric technologies, effectively reduce the energy consumption of traditional sensors.</p>
            <p>In air and water quality monitoring, chemical sensors improve detection sensitivity for pollutants like microplastics and heavy metals through the synergistic effect of natural fluorescent probes and biosensing elements, adhering to the principles of low environmental impact of green chemistry. These advancements are propelling chemical sensing technology towards more eco-friendly and efficient directions, providing robust support for global environmental governance.</p>
