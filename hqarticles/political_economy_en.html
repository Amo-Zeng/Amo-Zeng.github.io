            <h3>III. The Political Economy of Global Supply Chains: The Complex Interplay of Geopolitics and Economic Dependence</h3>
            <p>Global supply chains, seen as the "invisible engine" of the era of globalization, are increasingly becoming a new battlefield in geopolitical博弈. Events like the U.S.-China trade war, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed the fragility of global supply chains and sparked profound reflections on the global economic governance system. The political economy of global supply chains is no longer just an economic efficiency issue but a complex proposition concerning international power dynamics, national security, and development interests.</p>
            <h4>3.1 Global Supply Chains: From Efficiency First to Security Priority</h4>
            <p>Traditionally, global supply chains emerged as a product of economic globalization, aiming for cost minimization and efficiency maximization. Multinational corporations distributed production across different countries and regions to optimize factor costs and market advantages. This "efficiency first" logic shaped the global economic landscape over the past decades and drove rapid economic development.</p>
            <p>However, as international situations grow increasingly complex and geopolitical risks rise, the "safety valve" of global supply chains is becoming apparent. Production disruptions and logistics interruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted overdependence on single countries or regions; the energy crisis triggered by the Russia-Ukraine conflict exposed vulnerabilities in global energy supply chains; and tensions in the Taiwan Strait pose significant challenges to the security of global high-tech supply chains.</p>
            <h4>3.2 Supply Chain Restructuring Under Geopolitics: The Focus of Great Power Rivalry</h4>
            <p>Facing supply chain security threats, countries are reevaluating their supply chain strategies, considering them a critical component of national security. The U.S. has introduced initiatives like the "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" and the "Chips Act" to regain dominance in key supply chains; the EU has enacted the "European Critical Raw Materials Act" to reduce dependence on individual countries; Japan and South Korea are also actively diversifying supply chains to reduce reliance on the Chinese market.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, China is building a "dual circulation" development model, promoting self-reliance in key technologies, and strengthening cooperation with countries along the Belt and Road Initiative to create a more secure and stable supply chain system. The restructuring of global supply chains has become a focal point of great power rivalry, with nations striving to balance efficiency and security.</p>
            <h4>3.3 Economic Dependence and Geopolitics: The Dual Nature of Global Supply Chains</h4>
            <p>Global supply chains are both a product of economic globalization and an extension of geopolitics. Economic interdependence can provide a foundation for cooperation, reducing conflict risks; however, excessive dependence can also be a geopolitical bargaining chip, potentially leading to conflicts.</p>
            <p>For example, the global semiconductor supply chain’s reliance on Taiwan is both an efficiency outcome and a high-risk geopolitical issue; OPEC’s control over global energy markets is both an economic interest safeguard and a demonstration of international political influence.</p>

            <h3>IV. The Convergence of Digital Economy, Green New Deal, and Global Supply Chains: Reshaping the Future Political and Economic Landscape</h3>
            <p>The digital economy, Green New Deal, and global supply chains are not isolated but interwoven and mutually influential. Their convergence challenges existing economic models and power structures, driving the reshaping of the global political and economic landscape.</p>
            <h4>4.1 Digital Economy and Green New Deal: The Combination of Technological Revolution and Sustainable Development</h4>
            <p>The integration of the digital economy and the Green New Deal offers new possibilities for sustainable development. Digital technologies can optimize energy use, reduce carbon emissions, and drive the realization of a green economy. For instance, blockchain can enhance the transparency of carbon trading markets, AI can optimize smart grid scheduling, and big data can predict energy demand and optimize resource allocation.</p>
            <p>Simultaneously, the Green New Deal provides new opportunities for the digital economy. Green industries require extensive digital technology support, such as smart grids, smart cities, and electric vehicles, injecting new momentum into the digital economy’s sustainable development.</p>
            <h4>4.2 Digital Economy and Global Supply Chains: Data-Driven and Security-Oriented</h4>
            <p>The development of the digital economy relies on global supply chains, while supply chain security depends on digital technologies. Digital technologies can enhance supply chain transparency and traceability, such as using blockchain for real-time monitoring and trustworthy data sharing, and AI for risk prediction and optimal scheduling.</p>
            <p>However, the digital economy also exacerbates geopolitical risks in global supply chains. For example, the digitalization of semiconductor supply chains relies on advanced chip production, primarily concentrated in a few regions, making semiconductors a focal point of geopolitical rivalry.</p>
            <h4>4.3 Green New Deal and Global Supply Chains: Sustainable Development and Security-Oriented</h4>
            <p>The implementation of the Green New Deal requires global supply chain support, while supply chain security needs the Green New Deal’s safeguards. The Green New Deal emphasizes green, low-carbon, and circular economic models, requiring global supply chain cooperation, such as promoting green energy supply and facilitating international trade in green products.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the Green New Deal enhances supply chain security. For example, by promoting renewable energy development and utilization, reducing dependence on fossil fuels, and lowering geopolitical risks in energy supply chains; by promoting localized production and supply chain diversification, reducing dependence on single countries or regions, and enhancing supply chain resilience.</p>
