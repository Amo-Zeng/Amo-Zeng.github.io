            <h2>Reconstructing Political Economy in the Context of Globalization and Digital Capitalism: Towards a Sustainable Pathway for Ecological Civilization and Local Governance</h2>
            <p>Driven by both globalization and digital technology, the global economy is undergoing a profound paradigm shift. Traditional political economy theories, rooted in the logic of material production and capital accumulation from the industrial era, are increasingly inadequate for interpreting the complex interplay between the digital economy, globalization, and environmental crises.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>
            <p>Digital capitalism, with data as a production factor and algorithms as the driving force, has reconfigured the operational logic of the global economy, while globalization has accelerated the cross-border flow of capital, labor, and technology, posing new challenges to local economies and governance systems. Simultaneously, global issues such as climate change, resource depletion, and social inequality are becoming increasingly prominent, forcing humanity to reassess the relationship between economic development and ecological sustainability. In this context, reconstructing political economy theory is both a response to global transformations and an active exploration of social justice and ecological civilization.</p>

            <h3>Key Issues and Solutions</h3>
            
            <article>
                <h4>1. Data Production and Global Governance: From Ownership to Fair Distribution</h4>
                <p>Under digital capitalism, data has become a new production factor, but its immaterial and renewable nature poses fundamental challenges to traditional labor value theory and capital theory. The uniqueness of data production lies in the fact that its value primarily derives from users' unconscious actions rather than direct labor input, making issues of data ownership, usage rights, and profit distribution exceptionally complex.</p>
                <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Legislate to clarify users' fundamental rights as data creators and establish a data dividend system</li>
                    <li>Local governance systems should enhance data autonomy and formulate local data protection regulations</li>
                    <li>Develop decentralized data storage and trading platforms to break the market monopoly of large tech companies</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            
            <article>
                <h4>2. Algorithmic Decision-Making and the Green Economy: From Technological Monopoly to Ecological Empowerment</h4>
                <p>The central role of algorithms in resource allocation not only reshapes market competition but also poses significant challenges to environmental sustainability. Currently, algorithm-driven global value chains overly emphasize efficiency optimization, often neglecting their environmental externalities.</p>
                <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Promote ecological transformation in algorithm design and establish a "green algorithm" framework</li>
                    <li>Integrate carbon footprint calculations in the logistics sector and prioritize low-carbon transportation routes</li>
                    <li>Combine carbon trading markets with algorithmic regulation, using market incentives to drive the synergy between technology and the environment</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            
            <article>
                <h4>3. Digital Labor and Social Equity: From Exploitation to Symbiosis</h4>
                <p>Digital capitalism has given rise to new labor models, particularly the gig economy within the platform economy, which blurs the boundaries between workers and employers and exacerbates social inequality. Groups such as food delivery riders, ride-sharing drivers, and social media content creators often face challenges such as low wages, high intensity, and lack of social security.</p>
                <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>International organizations should establish global labor standards to clarify the labor-legal relationships in the platform economy</li>
                    <li>Local governments should develop social security systems adapted to the digital era</li>
                    <li>Develop decentralized labor platforms to enable workers to directly participate in value distribution</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            
            <article>
                <h4>4. Globalization and Sustainable Local Governance: From Conflict to Symbiosis</h4>
                <p>Globalization presents dual challenges to local economies and cultures. The global strategies of multinational corporations often conflict with local economic goals, while global capital flows increase fiscal uncertainty at the local level.</p>
                <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adopt diversified economic development strategies to reduce over-reliance on foreign investment</li>
                    <li>Establish robust fiscal systems to enhance the capacity to respond to global financial risks</li>
                    <li>Enhance local cultural vitality through cultural industry policies and educational activities</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <h3>Expected Outcomes</h3>
            <p>Through in-depth exploration of these issues and the proposed solutions, we aim to provide new perspectives for reconstructing political economy theory in the context of globalization and digital capitalism:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Theoretical Innovation:</strong> Redefining core concepts such as value, labor, and capital</li>
                <li><strong>Policy Construction:</strong> Proposing a global-local collaborative governance framework</li>
                <li><strong>Practical Pathways:</strong> Driving change through technological innovation, institutional reform, and social equity</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Globalization and digital capitalism are reshaping the global economic power structure, presenting unprecedented challenges and opportunities. In the face of this transformation, traditional political economy theories must evolve to address new realities. By redefining the logic of data production, algorithmic decision-making, and digital labor, and exploring symbiotic pathways for globalization and local governance, we can provide theoretical support and practical guidance for building a more just, green, and sustainable world.</p>
