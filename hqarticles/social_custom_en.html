            <h2>Technology and Traditional Customs: Cultural Heritage and Innovation in the Context of Globalization</h2>
            <p>In today's society, technology and globalization are profoundly shaping the preservation and innovation of culture, especially in the preservation, dissemination, and development of traditional customs. Technology, as a powerful driving force, not only promotes economic development and lifestyle convenience but also serves as a vital medium for cultural exchange and innovation. Meanwhile, globalization provides a platform for cross-cultural interaction, allowing traditional customs to spread and blend globally. Here, we will explore from several angles how technology interacts with traditional customs in a globalized context to form an ecosystem that both preserves tradition and fosters innovation.</p>

            <h3>I. The Role of Technology in Cultural Heritage</h3>
            <h4>1. Digital Preservation and Dissemination:</h4>
            <p>Traditional customs such as dance, music, and crafts rely on oral tradition and manual skills, yet these cultural heritages face the risk of extinction due to modernization. Technology provides an effective means of digitization, converting these intangible cultural heritages into permanent digital archives. With high-definition video, 3D scanning, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR) technologies, traditional customs can be vividly displayed and permanently preserved. For example, many museums and cultural institutions use digital technology to create 3D models of traditional costumes and instruments, ensuring that culture can be transmitted through virtual spaces even if the physical items disappear.</p>
            <h4>2. Intelligent and Personalized Experiences:</h4>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data analytics make the transmission and presentation of traditional customs more personalized and intelligent. By understanding the interests and needs of different audiences, cultural events can adjust content and format according to participants' preferences, enhancing engagement. Additionally, AI can simulate the teaching process of traditional crafts, allowing learners to master skills without a direct master's guidance.</p>

            <h3>II. Cultural Exchange and Integration in a Globalized Context</h3>
            <h4>1. Cross-Cultural Spread of Festivals and Celebrations:</h4>
            <p>Globalization means traditional festivals are no longer confined to their places of origin. For instance, Chinese New Year is celebrated worldwide, with Western countries hosting dragon boat races or lantern festivals, while Chinese cities display Christmas lights. These activities are not just cultural dissemination but also cultural fusion and innovation, reflecting the multicultural landscape of globalization.</p>
            <h4>2. Fusion in Culinary Culture:</h4>
            <p>Globalization has facilitated the flow of ingredients and the exchange of culinary techniques, leading to the emergence of fusion cuisine. Examples include Korean kimchi in Mexican burritos, or Italian herbs in Japanese sushi, directly showcasing cultural exchange. This innovation not only caters to people's desire for novel flavors but also promotes mutual understanding and appreciation among different cultures.</p>

            <h3>III. Sustainable Development of Traditional Customs and Environmental Ethics</h3>
            <h4>1. Green Cultural Practices:</h4>
            <p>The role of traditional customs in environmental protection should not be underestimated. Through technology, traditional rituals can move towards paperless or use eco-friendly materials, reducing environmental impact. Festival celebrations can also employ electronic fireworks or simplified packaging to reduce pollution. Technology can also promote eco-friendly agricultural practices, like scientific wildlife release and ecological farming, ensuring that traditions align with modern environmental ethics.</p>
            <h4>2. Education and Cultural Innovation:</h4>
            <p>Through educational systems and social activities, public environmental awareness is raised, preserving and promoting eco-friendly traditional culture. Technology can help create new cultural forms, such as environmental-themed festival celebrations, using virtual or augmented reality to let participants experience the importance of environmental conservation and the new face of traditional customs.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Technology and globalization together drive the protection, dissemination, and innovation of traditional customs. In this process, traditional customs are not only better preserved and transmitted but also appear in modern society in new forms through technological means, attracting the attention and participation of new generations. Meanwhile, globalization provides a vast stage for cultural exchange, enabling people from different cultural backgrounds to learn from and integrate with each other, creating a richer cultural landscape. The future of cultural development needs to find a balance between preserving tradition and embracing innovation, building an ecosystem that respects history while facing the future. In this way, traditional customs will continue to serve as treasures of human civilization, inspiring new cultural creativity and promoting the sustainable development of global culture.</p>
            <p>Through this approach, we not only protect and transmit traditional culture but also drive cultural innovation and integration, revitalizing cultural heritage in contemporary society.</p>
