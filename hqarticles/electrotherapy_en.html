            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Electrotherapy, which involves the treatment of various conditions by stimulating the nervous system with electric currents or magnetic fields, has become a significant tool in modern medicine and health care. In recent years, electrotherapy has not only been widely applied in clinical treatments but has also garnered attention for its roles in promoting neuroplasticity, mental health, beauty care, athletic performance enhancement, and non-traditional fields. This article will explore the applications of electrotherapy in these diverse areas, its profound impacts, and the future prospects.</p>

            <h2>Neuroplasticity and Electrotherapy</h2>
            <p><strong>Neuroplasticity</strong> refers to the brain's and nervous system's ability to change its structure and function through learning and experience. Electrotherapy enhances neuroplasticity in several ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Synaptic Plasticity</strong>: Electrotherapy can enhance the strength and stability of synapses, facilitating information transfer between neurons and reorganizing neural circuits.</li>
                <li><strong>Neurotrophic Factors</strong>: It can increase the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF), promoting neuron growth and regeneration.</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency and Intensity Dependence</strong>: Different parameters of electrical stimulation can produce various neuromodulatory effects, providing a theoretical basis for personalized treatment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Application Examples:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Post-Stroke Sequelae</strong>: Through transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), it enhances neuronal activity around the damaged brain area, promoting functional recovery.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</strong>: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can effectively regulate brain regions involved in emotional processing, reducing symptoms.</li>
                <li><strong>Neurodegenerative Diseases</strong>: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for conditions like Parkinson's disease improves motor symptoms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Combining Electrotherapy with Psychotherapy</h2>
            <p>The integration of electrotherapy with psychotherapy offers a new perspective on mental health treatment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rapid Symptom Relief</strong>: Electrotherapy can quickly alleviate symptoms, providing a better starting point for psychotherapy.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Treatment Efficacy</strong>: Electrotherapy modulates brain activity, making patients more receptive to psychotherapy.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Side Effects</strong>: Guidance from psychotherapy can mitigate fears related to electrotherapy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Application Examples:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Depression</strong>: TMS and tDCS combined with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) offer rapid and effective treatment options.</li>
                <li><strong>Anxiety Disorders</strong>: By altering brain electrical activity, it enhances the effects of psychotherapy.</li>
            </ul>
