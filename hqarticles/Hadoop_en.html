            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Since its inception in 2006, Hadoop, a big data processing framework, has journeyed through nearly two decades. As a pioneer in the big data field, Hadoop rapidly became the standard tool for processing large-scale data due to its high scalability and fault tolerance. However, as technology continues to advance and market demands evolve, Hadoop faces new challenges and opportunities. This article will explore Hadoop's next decade from four aspects: technological innovation, ecosystem evolution, enterprise digital transformation, and competition and symbiosis with新一代大数据技术 (next-generation big data technologies).</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Hadoop's Technological Evolution and Ecosystem Evolution</h2>
            <p>The core of Hadoop initially consisted of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and MapReduce, laying the foundation for distributed storage and computation. However, as data scales expanded and data types diversified, the single MapReduce computation model gradually showed limitations, especially in handling complex queries and real-time data.</p>
            <p>To address these challenges, the Hadoop community gradually introduced more components, forming what is now known as the "Hadoop ecosystem." Projects like Hive, Pig, and Spark have made Hadoop not just a batch processing framework but also capable of supporting interactive queries, stream processing, and more. The rise of Spark, in particular, provided more efficient in-memory computation capabilities, further solidifying Hadoop's position in the big data processing field.</p>

            <h2>Hadoop vs. Next-Generation Big Data Technologies: Competition and Symbiosis</h2>
            <p>Although Hadoop has dominated the big data field for years, with the passage of time, next-generation big data technologies such as Spark, Flink, and MongoDB have emerged, posing unprecedented challenges to Hadoop.</p>
            <h3>Hadoop's Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
            <p>Hadoop's core strengths lie in its distributed storage (HDFS) and computation (MapReduce) capabilities, enabling it to handle massive data with high reliability and scalability. However, Hadoop's weaknesses are also evident. Firstly, the batch processing mode of MapReduce makes it less efficient in handling real-time and high-frequency data. Secondly, Hadoop's architecture is relatively complex, with high deployment and maintenance costs.</p>
            <h3>The Rise of Next-Generation Big Data Technologies</h3>
            <p>Compared to Hadoop, next-generation big data technologies such as Spark and Flink have significant advantages in performance, flexibility, and usability. Spark, through in-memory computing, greatly enhances data processing speed, supporting multiple computation modes such as batch processing, stream processing, and machine learning. Flink is renowned for its superior stream processing capabilities, achieving exactly-once processing semantics.</p>
            <h3>Applicable Scenarios and Use Cases</h3>
            <p>Hadoop is suitable for scenarios requiring massive data processing with low real-time requirements, such as log analysis and data warehouse construction. Spark is more appropriate for high-speed computation scenarios, such as real-time recommendation systems and real-time report generation. Flink excels in financial risk control and real-time monitoring, while MongoDB is ideal for scenarios requiring fast storage and querying of unstructured data.</p>
