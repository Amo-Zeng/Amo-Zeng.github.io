            <h2>The Stars: The Narrative Field of Human Civilization</h2>
            <p>The stars are the earliest library of humanity and the grandest narrative field. In ancient times, the stars served as the carrier of sacred narratives. The ancient Egyptians predicted the flooding of the Nile through the rising of Sirius; the early Mesopotamians linked astrology with fate; the constellation myths in Greek mythology became the enlightenment materials for astronomy. These myths were not only records of primitive astronomy but also external expressions of the human spiritual world. In the stars, humanity found the language to converse with the universe and constructed the earliest worldview.</p>

            <h3>The Fading Stars: The Self-Obscuring of Civilization</h3>
            <p>However, with the acceleration of urbanization, the magnificent stars are quietly disappearing from human life. The lights of the city drive away the darkness and obscure the stars. The spread of light pollution makes 80% of urban residents unable to see the Milky Way, and 99% of urban residents lose the right to appreciate the magnificent stars. This obscuring of the stars is not only a physical retreat but also a spiritual loss.</p>

            <h3>Astrophotography: The Spiritual Redemption of Civilization</h3>
            <p>Facing the predicament of the fading stars, astrophotography has become an important cultural practice. From static to dynamic, from technical recording to poetic expression, astrophotography has completed the transformation from mechanical recording to artistic creation. Photographers capture the magnificence of the universe through their lenses, transforming scientific observation data into art, allowing more people to feel the charm of the universe.</p>

            <h3>Self-Redemption: Reclaiming the Lost Stars</h3>
            <p>In this dialogue with the stars, we are both the writers of civilization and the reflective thinkers of civilization. The fading of the stars reminds us: the progress of civilization should not come at the expense of nature, and the reconstruction of the spirit requires harmonious coexistence with nature. Reclaiming the lost stars is essentially a self-redemption of human civilization. We need to protect the stars that have witnessed human progress while developing, allowing the stars to once again illuminate the city and our spiritual world.</p>
