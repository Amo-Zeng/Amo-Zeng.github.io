            <h2>Multiscale Spatiotemporal Dynamic Modeling and Artificial Intelligence in Social-Ecological Systems: Promoting Harmony Between Humans and Nature</h2>
            <p>Traditional ecological modeling often focuses on a single time or spatial scale, which simplifies the complexity of the model but often overlooks the importance of multiscale interactions within the ecosystem. With the rapid development of data science and computational technology, multiscale spatiotemporal dynamic modeling (MSDM) has gradually become a new direction in ecological research. This method, by integrating data from different temporal and spatial scales, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic changes in ecosystems, reveal the complexity of cross-scale interactions, and more accurately predict the response of ecosystems to environmental changes.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>The Necessity of Multiscale Spatiotemporal Dynamic Modeling</h3>
            <p>Ecosystems are complex networks containing multilayered structures from individuals to ecosystems. Traditional single-scale modeling methods struggle to capture the interactions between these different layers. For example, when studying the impact of climate change on ecosystems, a single-time-scale model may not simultaneously consider short-term weather changes and long-term climate trends. Similarly, a single-spatial-scale model may overlook the complex interactions from individuals to populations to ecosystems.</p>
            <p>Multiscale spatiotemporal dynamic modeling, by integrating data from different temporal and spatial scales, can more comprehensively describe the dynamic changes in ecosystems. For example, by combining data from daily, monthly, yearly, and hourly, daily, seasonal time scales, a better understanding of the changes in ecosystems at different time scales can be achieved. Additionally, by combining data from different spatial scales from individuals to ecosystems, the interactions between different layers can be revealed.</p>

            <h3>Innovations in Multiscale Spatiotemporal Dynamic Modeling</h3>
            <p>The innovation of multiscale spatiotemporal dynamic modeling lies in its ability to integrate multiscale data, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic changes in ecosystems. Specifically, MSDM has the following innovations:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Integration:</strong> MSDM, by integrating data from different temporal and spatial scales, can more comprehensively describe the dynamic changes in ecosystems. For example, by combining satellite remote sensing data, meteorological data, and ground observation data, a multiscale ecosystem model can be constructed.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-scale Interactions:</strong> MSDM can reveal interactions between different scales. For example, by analyzing climate data and the response of ecosystems at different time scales, the impact of short-term weather changes and long-term climate trends on ecosystems can be understood.</li>
                <li><strong>Predictive Capability:</strong> MSDM, by integrating multiscale data, can more accurately predict the response of ecosystems to environmental changes. For example, by combining historical data and future climate predictions, the changes in ecosystems at different temporal and spatial scales can be more accurately predicted.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>AI-based Ecological System Prediction</h3>
            <p>With the increasing severity of global climate change, pollution, and ecosystem degradation, accurately predicting the behavior of ecosystems has become crucial. Traditional ecological modeling methods, while helpful in understanding the dynamic changes in ecosystems, are often limited by data processing capabilities and predictive accuracy. In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has provided new solutions for ecological system prediction.</p>
            <p>Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have unique advantages in handling large and complex datasets. By training these models, scientists can identify hidden patterns and trends in ecological data, thereby better understanding the behavior of ecosystems. For example, algorithms like random forests and support vector machines (SVM) can be used for classification and regression tasks, helping to predict species distribution and the health of ecosystems. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can handle more complex data structures such as images and time series data. For example, CNNs can be used to analyze satellite images, identifying changes in vegetation cover and water quality; RNNs can be used to predict the long-term impact of climate change on ecosystems.</p>

            <h3>Real-time Data Analysis and Prediction</h3>
            <p>Traditional ecological modeling methods often rely on static datasets, making real-time analysis and prediction difficult. AI-based models can dynamically update through real-time data streams, thereby improving the timeliness of predictions. By using IoT devices and sensor networks, various data from ecosystems, such as temperature, humidity, water quality, and air quality, can be collected in real-time. This data can be processed and analyzed in real-time through cloud computing platforms, reflecting the changes in ecosystems in a timely manner. Based on real-time data, AI models can continuously self-update and optimize, improving the accuracy of predictions. For example, through online learning algorithms, models can adjust based on new data to adapt to the dynamic changes in ecosystems.</p>

            <h3>Theoretical Foundation of Social-Ecological System Modeling</h3>
            <p>Social-ecological system modeling (SESM) is an innovative method that considers human activities and social factors, providing a more comprehensive and integrated perspective. This model not only considers the natural factors of ecosystems, such as climate change, biodiversity, and ecological processes, but also incorporates various dimensions of human activities, including policy impacts, economic activities, social behaviors, and cultural factors. By integrating methods from natural sciences and social sciences, social-ecological system modeling can more comprehensively reveal the impact of human activities on ecosystems and provide more integrated solutions.</p>

            <h3>Application Cases</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Climate Change and Human Adaptation</h4>
                    <p>Climate change is one of the major challenges facing the world today. Traditional ecological models struggle to fully reveal the impact of climate change on human society. Social-ecological system modeling, by integrating climate change models and human social behavior models, can more accurately predict the impact of climate change on agriculture, fisheries, and urban infrastructure, and provide targeted adaptation strategies. For example, in coastal areas, social-ecological system modeling can help governments develop policies to address sea-level rise, protecting coastal residents and ecosystems.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Biodiversity Conservation</h4>
                    <p>Biodiversity conservation is not just an ecological issue but also a social one. Social-ecological system modeling, by analyzing the impact of human activities on biodiversity, can provide more comprehensive protection strategies. For example, in tropical rainforest areas, social-ecological system modeling can help identify the impact of local residents' economic activities on rainforest ecosystems and propose policy recommendations that balance ecological protection and social development.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Urban Sustainable Development</h4>
                    <p>The urbanization process has profound impacts on the ecological environment. Social-ecological system modeling can help urban planners develop more sustainable strategies. By integrating models of urban economic activities, social behaviors, and ecosystems, social-ecological system modeling can provide comprehensive solutions for urban green space planning, pollution control, and resource utilization, promoting sustainable urban development.</p>
