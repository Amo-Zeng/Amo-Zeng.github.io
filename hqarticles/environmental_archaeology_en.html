            <h2>The Mirror of Nature: Human Civilization and Ecological Change from an Archaeological Perspective</h2>
            <p>In the long course of history, human civilizations have shone like bright stars, only to fade away. When we trace the rise and fall of these civilizations, we discover a thought-provoking pattern: floods and droughts, two seemingly opposing natural phenomena, act as silent witnesses, playing a crucial role on the stage of civilization. At the same time, archaeology, especially environmental archaeology, reveals the complex interactions between human civilizations and natural environments through its unique perspective and methods. Through archaeological remains, we can not only recreate the grandeur of ancient landscapes and the prosperity of biodiversity, but also glimpse the fragility and resilience of human civilizations.</p>

            <h3>Floods and Droughts: Dual Witnesses to the Rise and Fall of Civilizations</h3>
            <h4>The Revelation of the Nile: Flood and the Coexistence of Civilization</h4>
            <p>The Egyptian civilization is one of the earliest human civilizations, closely related to the flooding of the Nile. Every summer, the Nile's floodwaters carried fertile silt, bringing hope for a bountiful harvest to the farmlands along its banks. The ancient Egyptians viewed the floods as divine gifts, observing their patterns, developing advanced agricultural techniques, and building magnificent pyramids and temples, creating a splendid civilization.</p>
            <p>However, floods were not an eternal blessing. When climate change disrupted the flood cycle, or when human overdevelopment unbalanced the river ecosystem, floods turned into catastrophic disasters. Archaeologists have discovered in Egyptian sites that the decline of ancient Egyptian civilization was closely related to the reduction and disorder of the Nile's floods.</p>
            <h4>A Warning from the Fertile Crescent: Drought and the Collapse of Civilization</h4>
            <p>In stark contrast to the Egyptian civilization, the Sumerian civilization in the Fertile Crescent declined due to drought. The waters of the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers nourished this fertile land, giving rise to the world's earliest city-states and writing systems. However, as the climate gradually became drier, water resources in the Fertile Crescent became increasingly scarce, severely impacting agricultural production and exacerbating social conflicts, eventually leading to the collapse of the civilization.</p>
            <p>Archaeological evidence shows that during the later stages of the Sumerian civilization, droughts occurred frequently, river flows decreased significantly, and lakes and marshes gradually dried up. The once-prosperous cities became ruins in the desert. This once-glorious civilization ultimately succumbed to the onslaught of drought.</p>

            <h3>Civilization in the Trash: Insights from Environmental Archaeology</h3>
            <p>Trash, the most prominent symbol of modern civilization, reveals the true face of ancient human society through its unique perspective. In the context of archaeology, garbage heaps are no longer useless waste but "time capsules" rich in environmental information. They record the dietary structure, health status, and complete history of interaction between ancient humans and their natural environment, providing new dimensions for understanding the evolution of human civilization.</p>
            <h4>Material Remains in Ancient Trash Heaps: A True Reflection of the Nutritional Pyramid</h4>
            <p>By analyzing grease residues in pottery shards, proportions of animal bones, and types of plant seeds, archaeologists can reconstruct ancient human dietary structures. At the Yuchanyan site in Hunan, China, the 19,000-year-old shell layers reveal the ancient dependence on aquatic resources, while in the Teotihuacan site in Mexico, the 20% proportion of corn remains indicates that agriculture had deeply embedded itself in local social structures. These findings not only showcase the dietary habits of ancient people in different regions but also reflect early human cognition and utilization of environmental resources.</p>
            <h4>The Health Code in Trash Heaps: Decoding the Physical Condition of Ancient Populations</h4>
            <p>Through analysis of ancient fecal fossils, researchers found that the diversity of ancient gut microbiomes was far greater than that of modern humans, suggesting a healthier digestive system. At the same time, the trace elements and metabolites deposited in dental calculus provide direct evidence for studying the nutritional status and diseases of ancient people. At the Jemdet Nasr site in Iraq, archaeologists discovered a 3,500-year-old calculus sample, in which well-preserved plant remains indicated that adults were already consuming wheat products, a finding that aligns with the wear patterns on children's teeth.</p>
            <h4>Environmental Codes in Trash Heaps: Human Interaction with Nature</h4>
            <p>At Native American sites in North America, archaeologists found that as hunting tools improved, the proportion of animal bones changed significantly, showing the overhunting of large herbivores by humans. At many agricultural civilization sites, discarded grain residues and farming tool fragments reflect human continuous development and environmental transformation of the land. These findings prompt us to reconsider: In the long process of history, have humans been conquerors of the environment or participants in the ecosystem?</p>

            <h3>Time-Traveling Ecosystems: Reconstructing Ancient Landscapes and Biodiversity</h3>
            <p>Environmental archaeology, like a scientist traveling through time, brings us back to those distant ages, recreating the grandeur of ancient landscapes and the prosperity of biodiversity. This is not merely a simple restoration of the past but a profound reflection on current environmental issues and an active exploration of sustainable development of ecosystems in the future.</p>
            <h4>Recreating the Grand Canvas of Ancient Ecosystems</h4>
            <p>Environmental archaeology employs various techniques such as sediment analysis, palynology, and zooarchaeology, like a skilled artist, unfolding the canvas of ancient ecosystems. From dense primeval forests to vast grasslands, from rushing rivers to tranquil lakes, each landscape contains rich historical information and ecological stories.</p>
            <p>For example, through analysis of plant remains in peat bogs, we can reconstruct the types and distribution patterns of vegetation thousands of years ago, understanding the impact of climate change on forest ecosystems. By studying ancient lake sediments, we can reveal the evolution of lake ecosystems and the extent of human activity's influence.</p>
            <h4>Reconstructing Biodiversity: Decoding the Code of Ancient Life</h4>
            <p>By studying ancient animal and plant remains, we can understand the composition, distribution, and interrelationships of species in different historical periods, deciphering the codes of ancient life evolution. For instance, through analysis of animal bones in cave sites, we can understand ancient human hunting targets and methods, as well as the impact of human activities on wildlife populations. By identifying ancient plant remains, we can learn about the types and domestication processes of ancient crops, as well as human utilization of plant resources.</p>

            <h3>Reflections and Insights: The Path to Symbiosis between Human Civilization and Ecosystems</h3>
            <p>From the examples of Egypt and Sumer, we can see that floods and droughts are not just natural phenomena but significant factors affecting the rise and fall of civilizations. Environmental archaeological studies show that human activities have been important factors influencing the environment since ancient times. Overexploitation, invasive species, climate change, and other factors can lead to ecosystem collapse. This reminds us that while pursuing economic development, we must prioritize environmental protection to achieve harmony between humans and nature.</p>
            <p>During their long coexistence with nature, ancient humans accumulated rich ecological wisdom. For example, rotational crop farming and fallow systems in ancient agricultural production, as well as sustainable resource utilization in traditional hunting and fishing activities, are worth learning from. By drawing on ancient ecological wisdom, we can explore a path that aligns more closely with sustainable development principles.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Floods and droughts, these silent witnesses, remind us that human civilization is not separate from nature but closely interconnected with it. The environmental codes in trash heaps and the reconstruction of ancient ecosystems further reveal the complex interactions between humans and nature. In an era increasingly facing environmental challenges, the insights of environmental archaeology are more important than ever. We need to respect natural laws, protect the environment, learn from ancient ecological wisdom, and explore a path of harmonious coexistence with nature to create a sustainable future.</p>
