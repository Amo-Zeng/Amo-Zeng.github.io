            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Against the backdrop of rapid globalization and digital technology development, the extradition system, as a core mechanism of international judicial cooperation, is facing unprecedented complex challenges. The multidimensional globalization of economy, culture, and technology not only expands the scope and complexity of extradition cases but also introduces emerging issues such as data sovereignty, cultural differences, and AI ethics. Extradition is no longer merely a game of judicial sovereignty between nations; it has become a multifaceted intersection of economic interests, cultural identity, and ethical considerations under globalization. This article will explore the new challenges faced by the extradition system in the era of globalization from three dimensions: data sovereignty, cultural conflicts, and AI ethics, and propose potential future solutions.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Data Sovereignty and Legal Conflicts in Extradition</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Concept and Importance of Data Sovereignty</h3>
            <p>Data sovereignty refers to a country's control and management rights over the data generated, stored, and processed by its citizens and enterprises. In the digital economy era, data is not only the core of personal privacy but also a crucial element of national security and economic competitiveness. Governments around the world, through legislation such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), strengthen the protection of data to safeguard citizens' privacy, national security, and economic development.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Data Sovereignty Conflicts in Extradition Cases</h3>
            <p>In cross-border extradition cases, the requesting country often demands that the requested country provide data related to the accused, especially the large amount of user data held by multinational tech companies. This demand often leads to conflicts over data sovereignty. For example, the United States has repeatedly requested China to extradite citizens suspected of cybercrime, but the Chinese government may refuse to provide relevant data based on data sovereignty and citizen privacy protection. This conflict is not only between nations but also between tech companies and governments.</p>
            <h3>1.3 Lack of International Rules for Cross-border Data Flows</h3>
            <p>The global flow of data makes data sovereignty issues in cross-border extradition cases even more complex. Currently, the international community lacks unified cross-border data flow rules, and the differences in data protection laws among countries lead to disagreements in extradition cases. For instance, the EU's GDPR emphasizes strict personal data protection, while the United States has relatively lax data protection requirements under national security and law enforcement needs. This lack of international rules makes it difficult to resolve data sovereignty conflicts in extradition cases.</p>

            <h2>2. Cultural Conflicts and the Complexity of Extradition Decisions</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Cultural Identity and Value Conflicts</h3>
            <p>Globalization not only brings economic integration but also cultural collisions. The cultural backgrounds, values, and legal traditions of different countries and regions have a profound impact on extradition cases. For example, some countries may refuse to extradite their citizens based on cultural or religious considerations, believing that their actions, although considered crimes in other countries' laws, are not severe in their own cultural context.</p>
            <h3>2.2 Impact of Cultural Differences on Extradition Decisions</h3>
            <p>Cultural differences not only affect the legal application of extradition but may also influence political decisions. Some countries may refuse to extradite their citizens based on cultural or political reasons, fearing that extradition would harm their cultural identity or political interests. This cultural difference and value conflict make extradition cases more complex, and countries need to consider multiple factors such as law, culture, and politics when handling extradition cases.</p>
            <h3>2.3 Cultural Adaptability of the Extradition System</h3>
            <p>To address the cultural challenges brought by globalization, the extradition system needs to have a certain degree of cultural adaptability. When formulating extradition policies, countries should consider the differences in values under different cultural backgrounds to avoid extradition failures due to cultural conflicts. For example, in extradition cases, countries can resolve disputes caused by cultural differences through negotiations and dialogues to ensure the fairness and legitimacy of extradition.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>3. AI Ethics and the Fairness of Extradition Decisions</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Application of AI in Extradition Cases</h3>
            <p>In extradition cases, the application of artificial intelligence technology mainly involves facial recognition, big data analysis, and intelligent algorithm decision-making. AI can quickly process massive amounts of data, provide accurate analysis results, and accelerate the progress of extradition procedures. For example, in transnational terrorism cases, AI can analyze surveillance videos, social media information, and communication records worldwide to quickly identify suspects and provide strong evidence support for extradition.</p>
            <h3>3.2 Algorithmic Discrimination and Fairness in Extradition Decisions</h3>
            <p>Although AI demonstrates powerful capabilities in extradition cases, its algorithms may exhibit discrimination and biases, affecting the fairness of extradition decisions. Algorithmic discrimination mainly stems from incomplete data and training biases in algorithms. For instance, some AI systems may contain excessive records of crimes by specific ethnic groups or social strata in their training data, leading to biased identification and judgment of these groups in practical applications. This bias may result in certain groups being more easily identified as criminal suspects, thus receiving unjust treatment in extradition cases.</p>
            <h3>3.3 AI Ethics and Human Rights Protection</h3>
            <p>The application of AI in extradition cases may have a profound impact on human rights. On the one hand, AI can improve the efficiency of handling extradition cases, ensuring that suspects are promptly brought to justice; on the other hand, if AI technology is misused or errors occur, it may lead to innocent individuals being wrongfully extradited or detained, seriously infringing on their human rights. To ensure the fairness of extradition decisions, countries need to take measures to reduce discrimination and biases in AI algorithms and adhere to ethical principles such as presumption of innocence, privacy protection, and transparency.</p>

            <h2>4. Innovation and Global Governance of the Future Extradition System</h2>
            <h3>4.1 Coordination of Data Sovereignty and International Rules</h3>
            <p>To resolve data sovereignty conflicts in extradition cases, the international community needs to establish clearer and more unified international rules. Future international rules may include transparency in cross-border data flows, minimum standards for privacy protection, and simplified judicial cooperation, ensuring effective cross-border investigations and extraditions while protecting data sovereignty.</p>
            <h3>4.2 Cultural Dialogue and Adaptability of the Extradition System</h3>
            <p>In the context of globalization, the extradition system needs to continuously adapt to new challenges and changes. Countries should strengthen the signing and revision of extradition treaties, enhance judicial cooperation, simplify extradition procedures, and resolve disputes caused by cultural differences through cultural dialogue and negotiations to ensure the fairness and legitimacy of extradition.</p>
            <h3>4.3 AI Ethics and International Cooperation</h3>
            <p>To ensure that AI applications in extradition cases comply with international human rights standards, countries need to strengthen cooperation and formulate unified ethical standards and legal norms. For example, the United Nations can promote the development of global ethical guidelines for AI applications to ensure that all countries adhere to common human rights protection principles when using AI technology in extradition cases.</p>

            <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In the era of globalization and the deep integration of digital technology, the extradition system is experiencing unprecedented challenges and transformations. The multidimensional challenges of data sovereignty, cultural conflicts, and AI ethics require countries to find a balance point in the extradition system, taking into account the multiple needs of the economy, culture, and technology. By establishing unified international rules, strengthening cultural dialogue and international cooperation, the extradition system can play a more positive role in the process of globalization, providing solid legal guarantees for the development of the global economy, culture, and technology. The future extradition system will find a new balance between data protection, privacy rights, cultural identity, and AI ethics, promoting further improvement of the global governance system.</p>
