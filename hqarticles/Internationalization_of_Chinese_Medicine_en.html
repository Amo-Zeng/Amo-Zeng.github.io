            <h2>Internationalization of Traditional Chinese Medicine: Strategies and Pathways</h2>
            <p>As an integral part of Chinese culture with thousands of years of heritage, here are some suggestions and improvements to enhance the quality of strategies and pathways for the internationalization of Traditional Chinese Medicine:</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Optimization of Titles and Subtitles</h3>
            <p><strong>Title:</strong> Could be more concise, for example, "Internationalization of Traditional Chinese Medicine: Strategies and Pathways".<br>
            <strong>Subtitle:</strong> Can be refined into more specific sub-themes like "Technology Integration", "Cultural Dissemination", "Laws, Regulations, and Standards".</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Content Deepening</h3>
            <h4>Technology Integration Section</h4>
            <p>You could add specific case studies or success stories, like how a TCM company uses big data to enhance drug efficacy assessment. Mention some existing AI projects or collaborations in TCM to bolster the empirical content.</p>
            <h4>Cultural Soft Power Section</h4>
            <p>Include discussions on how TCM blends with Western culture, making it more adaptable to the international market while retaining its uniqueness. Mention successful cultural dissemination cases, like "The Increased Acceptance of Acupuncture Internationally".</p>
            <h4>Laws, Regulations, and Standards Section</h4>
            <p>Discuss specific international cooperation cases in detail, such as WHO's efforts in standardizing TCM. Address challenges like the differences in certification and regulation of TCM across countries, and how these can be addressed through international cooperation.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Enhancing Logical Coherence</h3>
            <p>Add transitional paragraphs or sentences between major sections to make the transition from one topic to another smoother. For example, from technology integration to cultural dissemination, mention how technology aids in spreading TCM culture.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Citations and References</h3>
            <p>Increase academic citations and references to enhance the article's scholarly credibility and authority. For instance, cite international papers or reports on TCM research.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion Section</h3>
            <p>In the conclusion, clearly outline future challenges and opportunities, and provide specific recommendations or future research directions.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Language and Expression</h3>
            <p>Some sentences could be more concise. For example, "Traditional Chinese Medicine, as an important part of Chinese culture, has a history of thousands of years" could be simplified to "Traditional Chinese Medicine has a long history and is an integral part of Chinese culture." Ensure the accuracy of the terminology used and avoid repetitive or similar words.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Charts or Data Support</h3>
            <p>If possible, include charts or data to support your points, like statistics on the acceptance of TCM in different countries or data on technology's contribution to the development of TCM.</p>
