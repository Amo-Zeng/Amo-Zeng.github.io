            <h2>Introduction: When Food Safety Enters the "Battlefield of Cognition"</h2>
            <p>Food safety has long transcended the basic question of "is it toxic?" It is quietly evolving into a battle over <span class="highlight">cognitive sovereignty</span>—when technology reshapes taste, culture severs memory, and algorithms dominate choice, public judgment over "what to eat" is being systematically undermined.</p>
            <p>Traditional regulation focuses on "visible risks" such as microbial contamination, chemical residues, and labeling compliance, while overlooking deeper <span class="highlight">hidden crises</span>: senses being manipulated, knowledge being forgotten, and decisions being outsourced. This crisis does not manifest as acute poisoning, but erodes <span class="highlight">cognitive autonomy</span> and <span class="highlight">dietary resilience</span> in chronic ways, ultimately shaking humanity's control over its own diet.</p>
            <p>Do we still possess <span class="highlight">dietary sovereignty</span>? — the ability of individuals to freely, rationally, and diversely decide what to eat, under conditions of transparent information, cultural continuity, and controllable technology?</p>
            <p>This article proposes a <span class="highlight">triple hidden crisis</span> analytical framework: <strong>sensory deception</strong>, <strong>intergenerational rupture</strong>, and <strong>algorithmic bias</strong>, revealing the systemic fragility of food safety in the cognitive dimension. Ultimately, it calls for building an <span class="highlight">inclusive, autonomous, and resilient</span> dietary ecosystem, redefining "food safety" as a manifestation of <span class="highlight">cognitive resilience</span> (Cognitive Resilience).</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Chapter 1: Sensory Deception — Programmable "Taste" and Perceptual Colonization</h2>
            <blockquote>
                "The sweetness you taste may never have existed."<br>
                This is not metaphor—it is technological reality.
            </blockquote>
            <p>From electric taste stimulation (e.g., Japan's "Taste the TV"), AR flavor synchronization (OVO devices), to molecular sensory design (artificial flavor molecules), food technology is bypassing chemical composition and directly intervening in <span class="highlight">neural perception pathways</span>. A global brand's "zero-sugar cola" uses aspartame, sucralose, combined with red packaging and carbonation, to <strong>induce a "hyper-sweet illusion" in the brain</strong>. Neuroscience research (Small et al., 2005) confirms that such "sensory mismatch" reshapes reward circuits, leading to desensitization to natural sweetness.</p>
            <p><em>The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health</em> (2022) notes: children who consume sensory-enhanced foods long-term show a 37% drop in fruit intake and significantly reduced preference for vegetables.</p>
            <p>The problem is: <strong>perception should be the "first line of defense" for food safety</strong>. It allows us to judge "is it spoiled?" or "is it fresh?" based on experience. But when technology can "program taste," this line of defense becomes meaningless. Consumers can no longer trust their tongues—what they taste is an algorithm-optimized "simulated experience," not real food.</p>
            <p>This is not merely technological abuse, but <span class="highlight">perceptual colonization</span>: corporations using the guise of "health" and "low-calorie" to manipulate senses. Consumers believe they are "choosing" low-sugar, but are actually being "trained" into a "health illusion" through neurofeedback loops. Worse, <strong>sensory addiction</strong> is more insidious than chemical addiction—it doesn't alter ingredient lists, but forms dependency through dopamine reinforcement.</p>
            <h3>How to Break Through?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Establish a <span class="highlight">"Sensory Transparency"</span> system: mandatory labeling of "virtual sweetness technology," "electric taste intervention," "flavor enhancement algorithms," etc.;</li>
                <li>Implement <span class="highlight">Neuro-Impact Assessment (NIA)</span>: conduct EEG, behavioral experiments, and long-term tracking on sensory-enhanced foods for children;</li>
                <li>Develop <span class="highlight">anti-deception devices</span>: e.g., wearable taste restorers that strip away sensory interference and restore authentic flavor.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="question">When "sweet" requires no sugar, and "umami" needs no MSG, can we still trust our senses?</p>

            <h2>Chapter 2: Intergenerational Rupture — Memory Loss and Erosion of Dietary Resilience</h2>
            <blockquote>
                "Mother doesn't pickle, daughter can't identify mushrooms."<br>
                This is not a family issue—it is the <span class="highlight">systemic erosion of dietary resilience</span>.
            </blockquote>
            <p>Urbanization, dual-income households, and the rise of ready-to-eat meals have transformed home kitchens from "production spaces" into "consumption terminals." Surveys show that in urban Chinese households, <strong>only 27% of children can describe how to make three traditional fermented foods</strong>, and 80% of teens rely on takeout (<em>Chinese Dietary Guidelines 2022</em>).</p>
            <p>Traditional dietary knowledge is a <span class="highlight">survival technology package transmitted across generations</span>—grandparents' pickling skills, mothers' holiday recipes, grandmothers' herbal remedies—forming an informal safety system based on long-term observation and trial-and-error. It doesn't rely on labs, but is highly context-adaptive.</p>
            <p>During a 2023 regional power outage, 78% of families suffered meat spoilage due to lack of safe storage knowledge. They couldn't smoke, salt, or ferment; many didn't even understand "anaerobic fermentation." In rural areas, traditional methods like cellar storage, ceramic jars, and lime-water preservation are still widely used, with spoilage rates under 10%.</p>
            <p>A deeper crisis lies in <span class="highlight">cultural stigmatization</span>. Cured meats are reduced to "carcinogens," kimchi to "nitrite bombs," ignoring traditional processes' risk-control mechanisms. South Korea's kimchi crisis is a case in point: media hyped "nitrite levels," but <em>Food Chemistry</em> (2021) research showed that <strong>homemade kimchi peaks in nitrites on day 7 and degrades rapidly, while industrial products, due to preservatives, prolong the danger period</strong>.</p>
            <p>Tradition is not "backward"—it is <span class="highlight">wisdom not yet fully scientificized</span>.</p>
            <h3>Key Breakthroughs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrate <span class="highlight">"Micro-Kitchen Science"</span> into elementary and secondary school labor curricula, teaching basic fermentation, dehydration, and safe pickling;</li>
                <li>Establish <span class="highlight">Community Food Memory Banks</span> through oral histories, digital archives, and video documentation to preserve local dietary wisdom;</li>
                <li>Support legalization of <span class="highlight">household food production</span>, include home fermentation in food safety training, and grant "micro-producer" status.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
                We lost the art of pickling, and with it, trust in time;<br>
                We lost fermentation wisdom, and with it, reverence for nature;<br>
                We lost intergenerational dialogue, and with it, dietary resilience.

            <h2>Chapter 3: Algorithmic Bias — Data Colonialism and Nutritional Exclusion</h2>
            <blockquote>
                "Your health is defined by algorithms."
            </blockquote>
            <p>As AI nutrition apps, smart fridges, and genetic testing become the basis for dietary decisions, we are outsourcing "what to eat" to algorithms. But these systems may be creating <span class="highlight">algorithmic malnutrition</span>—seemingly scientific, yet systematically excluding certain groups and cultures.</p>
            <h3>Three Coexisting Biases:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data bias</strong>: Training sets are dominated by Western middle-class diets. A major app labels natto as "high sodium risk," ignoring its vitamin K2 and probiotic value;</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural bias</strong>: African teff, Andean quinoa are classified as "low nutrient density," insect protein is marginalized;</li>
                <li><strong>Commercial bias</strong>: Apps partnered with brands promote high-profit processed foods, narrowing "health" to "purchaseability."</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Case Study</strong>: A diabetes app recommends "low-GI diets" for Asian users, but its list is almost entirely Western: whole wheat bread, oats—ignoring local staples like brown rice, buckwheat, and chickpeas. As a result, users abandon the plan due to cultural discomfort, returning to high-sugar diets. Worse, <strong>low-income groups</strong>, using free apps, are exposed to lower-quality recommendations, creating <span class="highlight">digital nutritional poverty</span>.</p>
            <p>The essence of algorithmic bias is <span class="highlight">systematic exclusion</span>: it doesn't directly reject a food, but through "not recommending," "not displaying," "not explaining," makes it "invisible" in cognition. Users believe they are making "scientific choices," but are unconsciously deprived of dietary diversity.</p>
            <h3>How to Reconstruct Algorithmic Justice?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Establish the <span class="highlight">Nutrition Algorithm Fairness Standards</span>, requiring disclosure of training data, cultural coverage, and commercial interests;</li>
                <li>Introduce the <span class="highlight">Dietary Diversity Index (DDI)</span>, mandating AI evaluation of cultural inclusivity in recommendations;</li>
                <li>Build a <span class="highlight">decentralized nutrition database</span>, allowing users to upload local food data, forming an open, diverse, self-organizing knowledge graph.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="question">When an algorithm says "this is the healthiest," does it represent science, or data hegemony?</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Toward "Cognitive Resilience" — Building an Inclusive Dietary Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>Sensory deception, intergenerational rupture, and algorithmic bias share three deep-seated challenges:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="highlight">Crisis of cognitive autonomy</span>: When perception is manipulated, memory is broken, and decisions are outsourced to algorithms, human autonomy in dietary judgment is eroding;</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Weakening of dietary resilience</span>: True resilience is not just resistance to contamination, but the ability to maintain healthy eating patterns under technological, cultural, and informational shocks;</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Lack of systemic inclusivity</span>: Existing food systems exclude minorities, marginalized cultures, and non-mainstream diets, exacerbating nutritional inequality.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>To address this triple crisis, we must move beyond "single-risk governance" and toward building an <span class="highlight">inclusive dietary ecosystem</span>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technological ethics</strong>: Establish <span class="highlight">"sensory informed consent"</span>, include sensory interventions in food disclosures—similar to "GMO" labels—to protect consumer <span class="highlight">perceptual autonomy</span>;</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural resilience</strong>: Recognize "household food memory" as a public health asset, promote intergenerational cooking, community knowledge transfer, and revival of festival diets, rebuilding <span class="highlight">dietary cultural continuity</span>;</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic justice</strong>: Require AI systems to have <span class="highlight">"cultural empathy"</span>, respect diverse dietary traditions, offer "alternative paths" instead of "single optimal solutions," achieving <span class="highlight">nutritional diversity justice</span>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>More profoundly, we must redefine the meaning of "food safety":</p>
            <ul>
                <li>From <strong>"non-toxic"</strong> → <strong>"informed autonomy"</strong>;</li>
                <li>From <strong>"nutritional adequacy"</strong> → <strong>"cognitive resilience"</strong>;</li>
                <li>From <strong>"passive defense"</strong> → <strong>"active construction"</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span class="highlight">Cognitive Resilience</span>—the ability of individuals to maintain authentic perception, continuous memory, and independent judgment in complex information environments—should become the core metric of food safety in the new era.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, food safety should not be a utopia of "zero risk," but a <span class="highlight">dynamic system that allows trial and error, respects diversity, and guarantees autonomy</span>. What we need is not cleaner food, but more <em>awake</em> consumers—those who can perceive truth, inherit memory, question algorithms, and safeguard their <span class="highlight">dietary sovereignty</span> amid technological tides.</p>
            <p class="slogan">
                In an era where technology, culture, and algorithms intertwine, true safety begins with the rediscovery of "humanity." Only when technology serves perception, culture nourishes memory, and algorithms respect difference, can food safety emerge from "hidden crisis" to "visible resilience."
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                We call not for more precise algorithms, but for clearer judgment;<br>
                Not for more efficient processing, but for more authentic perception;<br>
                Not for more uniform standards, but for richer choices.<br><br>
                <span class="conclusion">Food safety will ultimately return—to human dignity, and to dietary sovereignty.</span>
