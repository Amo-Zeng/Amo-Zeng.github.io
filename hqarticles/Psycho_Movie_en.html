            <h3>Basic Elements of Visual Language</h3>
            <p>Visual language is an indispensable part of film art, including elements such as color, composition, and lighting. In psychological films, color is often used to convey emotions and psychological states. For example, cool colors may represent loneliness and despair, while warm colors may represent warmth and hope. Composition, through the angle and layout of the shots, guides the audience's gaze and highlights important scenes and characters. The use of lighting can create different atmospheres; bright light may represent hope, while dim light may foreshadow danger or fear.</p>

            <h3>The Role of Music in Films</h3>
            <p>Music plays a crucial role in psychological films. It is not just background music but also a carrier of emotions and a creator of atmosphere. Through music, the audience can more deeply feel the emotions and psychological activities in the film, thus resonating with the characters. Music can convey complex emotions and psychological states through melody, rhythm, and instrument selection. For example, low tones can express sadness or tension, while lively melodies can convey joy or hope. Music can also create a specific atmosphere through different timbres and arrangements, such as mystery, horror, or romance.</p>

            <h3>Case Analysis</h3>
            <h4><strong>The Butterfly Effect</strong></h4>
            <p>In <strong>The Butterfly Effect</strong>, directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber use color changes to depict the protagonist Evan's psychological state. Each time Evan enters a different timeline, the color tone changes; cool colors represent his confusion and helplessness, while warm colors symbolize his hope and determination. In terms of composition, the shots often center on the protagonist, capturing his emotional changes through close-ups.</p>
            <h4><strong>Black Swan</strong></h4>
            <p>Darren Aronofsky's <strong>Black Swan</strong> uses light and shadow contrasts to depict the protagonist Nina's psychological split. In the film, Nina's stage career and real life are distinguished by obvious light and shadow contrasts. The strong light and gorgeous costumes on stage symbolize her dreams and achievements, while the dim light in real life reveals her inner struggle and breakdown.</p>
            <h4><strong>Good Will Hunting</strong></h4>
            <p>Gus Van Sant's <strong>Good Will Hunting</strong> deeply presents the psychological changes of the protagonist Will Hunting through the use of composition and lighting. In the film, Will's psychological state is subtly depicted through the angle of the shots and the changes in lighting. For example, in the psychologist Sean's office, the light gradually becomes softer, symbolizing Will's gradual opening up and healing.</p>
            <h4><strong>The Truman Show</strong></h4>
            <p>In <strong>The Truman Show</strong>, Philip Glass's score plays a key role. Its repetitive, cyclical musical themes not only enhance the film's rhythm but also symbolize Truman's helplessness and despair of being trapped in a fake world. The repetitiveness of the music closely aligns with the film's theme, allowing the audience to more deeply understand Truman's psychological state.</p>
            <h4><strong>Inception</strong></h4>
            <p>Hans Zimmer's score for <strong>Inception</strong> is full of tension and suspense. The most famous theme, "Time," conveys the passage of time in dreams and the urgency of the characters through a slow yet determined melody. The arrangement of the music is also very layered; as the dream levels deepen, the complexity and tension of the music gradually increase, enhancing the audience's emotional resonance.</p>
            <h4><strong>Before Sunrise</strong></h4>
            <p>The music in this film is created by multiple composers and combines classical, jazz, and folk styles. The soft and romantic atmosphere of the music resonates with the dialogue and emotions in the film, creating a warm and authentic atmosphere. The music not only enhances the romantic color of the film but also allows the audience to more deeply feel the emotional exchange between the characters.</p>

            <h3>Director's Creative Intent</h3>
            <p>Directors convey deep themes and emotions through visual language, music, and character psychological changes.

            <h3>Audience's Psychological Reactions</h3>
            <p>The audience feels the psychological tension and emotional fluctuations in the film through visual language, music, and character psychological changes. Changes in color, composition, lighting, and music arrangement directly affect the audience's emotional experience. For example, in <strong>The Butterfly Effect</strong>, the audience can intuitively feel the psychological changes of the protagonist Evan through color changes, thus more deeply understanding his confusion and struggle. The psychological changes of the characters not only drive the plot but also resonate with the audience and evoke emotional responses. The audience sees aspects of their own inner selves through the psychological changes of the characters, thus experiencing resonance. For example, Nash's resilience and hope in <strong>A Beautiful Mind</strong> make the audience feel the strength and courage to face difficulties; Jack's awakening in <strong>Fight Club</strong> makes the audience reflect on self-identity and social pressure. This resonance allows the audience to not only passively watch but also actively think and feel during the viewing process.</p>
