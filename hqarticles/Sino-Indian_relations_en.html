            <h3>I. Civilizational Dialogue: Constructing Asian Subjectivity and Innovating Non-Western Order</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Historical Lessons and Mutual Learning:</strong> As the only continuously developing civilizations among the four ancient civilizations, China and India could systematically reconstruct Eastern knowledge systems through establishing physical institutions like the "Asian Civilizations Research Institute."</li>
                <li><strong>Political Philosophy Dialogue:</strong> The similarities between India's "Dharma" governance concept and Confucian "Kingly Way" thought in legitimacy construction could provide theoretical resources as alternatives to Western liberal democracy.</li>
                <li><strong>Joint Technology Ethics Development:</strong> China and India could jointly formulate an "Eastern Digital Convention" to establish regulatory standards for new issues like algorithmic discrimination and AI colonialism.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Digital Economy Governance: Testing Ground for Global South Leadership</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Platform Economy Regulatory Innovation:</strong> Comparing India's Digital Markets Act with China's Platform Economy Anti-Monopoly Regulations to establish cross-border regulatory sandboxes and jointly build data localization storage and cross-border flow review mechanisms.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment System Interoperability:</strong> Promoting U-Pay compatibility with China UnionPay/Alipay standards to create non-dollar settlement channels and accelerate currency internationalization.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Skills Certification System:</strong> Co-creating a "Sino-Indian Digital Artisan Certification Standard" covering emerging fields like cloud computing operations and quantum computing.</li>
            </ol>

        <section>
            <h3>III. Youth Cognition Reconstruction: Breaking Emotional Traps in Mental Mapping</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Bias Quantitative Research:</strong> Studies show that while Chinese and Indian Gen Z are exposed to over 5 hours of daily information about each other, their favorability ratings remain at only 23%, with key cognitive blockages including the Kashmir dispute and 1962 war memories.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Decoupling Strategies:</strong> Joint participation in TikTok transnational co-creation challenges can increase mutual favorability by 19 percentage points, suggesting expansion into technology competition fields.</li>
                <li><strong>Education Cooperation 2.0:</strong> Upgrading the "Digital Dual Degree" program to a "Cognitive Reconstruction Module" with courses like Sino-Indian Conflict Transformation Case Studies.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h3>IV. Strategic Challenges and Breakthrough Pathways</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Geopolitical Stress Testing:</strong> Securing "technological middle ground" strategic ambiguity in 5G spectrum allocation and chip alliances.</li>
                <li><strong>Civilizational Discourse System Competition:</strong> Jointly releasing the Global Governance Effectiveness Index 2.0 incorporating non-Western metrics like collective well-being and civilizational continuity.</li>
                <li><strong>Intergenerational Cognitive Gap Repair:</strong> Establishing youth innovation incubators near disputed border areas with cross-border entrepreneurial data sharing via blockchain technology.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Conclusion: Restructuring the Global South Narrative Framework</h3>
            <p>In this era of Anthropocene crisis convergence, Sino-Indian cooperation should transcend bilateral dimensions. By establishing supranational institutions like the "Global South Technology Ethics Committee," both nations can transform their millennia of civilizational heritage into governance wisdom for addressing global challenges. There's urgent need to create a "Civilizational Dialogue Impact Tracking Platform" to monitor 20 core indicators in real-time, providing data support for civilizational evolution.</p>
