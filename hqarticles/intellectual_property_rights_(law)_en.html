            <h2>Conflict and Symbiosis Between Intellectual Property and Knowledge Sharing</h2>
            <p>Throughout human history, the creation and dissemination of knowledge have always been key driving forces behind societal progress. However, with the rapid development of digital technology, the value and dissemination methods of knowledge have undergone profound changes, and the intellectual property system faces unprecedented challenges and opportunities.</p>

            <h3>The Birth and Intent of the Intellectual Property System</h3>
            <p>The birth of the intellectual property system can be traced back to 17th-century Europe.

The core idea of knowledge sharing is that knowledge should be a common wealth of all humanity and should not be monopolized by a minority of individuals or institutions.</p>
