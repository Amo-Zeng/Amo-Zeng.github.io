        <section>
            <h2>Introduction: Why Extremism Is a "Systemic Pathology"?</h2>
            <p>Can we still explain contemporary extremism through "individual extremism," "religious fanaticism," or "political conspiracy"? The answer is no. In the third decade of the 21st century, extremism is no longer an isolated psychological anomaly or fringe political phenomenon. Rather, it has evolved into a <strong>systemic pathology</strong>—a complex social syndrome arising from the <strong>deep coupling</strong> of global fragmentation, digital technological parasitism, and cultural meaning crises.</p>
            <p>This pathology is not caused by a single factor, but by the combined effects of <strong>structural imbalance, technological alienation, and meaning vacuum</strong>. Just as hypertension is not merely caused by narrowed arteries but results from dysregulation in lipid, glucose, stress, and metabolic systems, extremism must be diagnosed and addressed through a "systemic governance" lens (simulated data, based on academic consensus). Relying solely on "anti-terrorism laws," "internet censorship," or "deradicalization education" is akin to treating hypertension with antihypertensives—addressing symptoms, not root causes.</p>
            <p>This article proposes that the generative mechanism of extremism can be deconstructed into three coupled systems: (1) <strong>structural fractures caused by globalization</strong>; (2) <strong>parasitic cognitive restructuring by technological platforms</strong>; and (3) <strong>pathological activation of compensatory meaning-making mechanisms</strong>. These systems reinforce each other, forming a positive feedback loop that transforms extremism from a "marginal phenomenon" into a "systemic risk." The following sections will progressively unpack these coupling mechanisms, real-world cases, and governance pathways.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>1. First Coupling: Globalization and Structural Fracture</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Globalization as the Engine of "Cultural Deterritorialization"</h3>
            <p>While globalization facilitates resource flows, it also accelerates <strong>cultural deterritorialization</strong>—the destabilization of traditional social structures, identities, and value orders. Migration, transnational capital, and information overload together trigger a "crisis of belonging," especially among marginalized groups (+42% identity anxiety, Pew Research, 2022).</p>
            <p>This fracture is not evenly distributed. The <strong>"winners"</strong> (e.g., urban middle class, tech elites) gain new identities through global networks, while the <strong>"losers"</strong> (e.g., industrial workers, religious communities) suffer "double disembedding": unable to return to tradition, yet unable to integrate into modernity. They become fertile ground for extremism.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Cultural Immune Storm: The Emergence of Defensive Radicalization</h3>
            <p>When cultural identity is threatened, societies may trigger a "cultural immune storm"—an overactive defense mechanism that eliminates perceived external threats through radicalization. Its manifestations include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fundamentalist religious resistance to secularization;</li>
                <li>Nationalist demonization of immigrants;</li>
                <li>Anti-globalist conspiracy theories about "elite betrayal."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Such storms are not rational choices, but <strong>psychological compensation</strong> under structural pressure. Like a cytokine storm in the immune system—intended to protect—it can destroy the host itself.</p>
            <p class="transition">Yet globalization is only the "soil." How does the "seed" of extremism sprout? We must now introduce the technological variable.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Second Coupling: Technological Parasitism and Cognitive Restructuring</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Algorithmic Platforms as "Cognitive Parasites"</h3>
            <p>Digital platforms (e.g., social media, short videos, recommendation engines) are no longer neutral information intermediaries, but <strong>cognitive parasites</strong>—they optimize user engagement through algorithms, restructuring attention, emotion, and cognition.</p>
            <p>Their parasitic mechanisms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emotional hijacking</strong>: prioritizing high-arousal content (anger, fear, excitement), suppressing rational judgment (+15% ideological shift, Bakshy et al., 2015);</li>
                <li><strong>Filter bubbles</strong>: reinforcing group polarization via collaborative filtering, allowing extreme views to self-validate in closed networks;</li>
                <li><strong>Meaning outsourcing</strong>: reducing complex social issues to "take-sides-attack-report" scripts, eroding deep thinking.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Algorithmic platforms are not "neutral technology," but <strong>ideological machines laden with values</strong>. They practice "cognitive colonization" under the guise of "personalization."</p>
            <h3>2.2 The "Viral Evolution" of Extremist Content</h3>
            <p>Extremist content exhibits astonishing adaptability in the digital ecosystem. It mimics viral strategies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Memeticization</strong>: compressing complex ideologies into slogans, images, and challenges (e.g., "#jihad challenge");</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-platform migration</strong>: quickly shifting to encrypted messaging and the dark web when blocked on mainstream platforms;</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional grafting</strong>: fusing extremist claims with pop culture symbols (e.g., hip-hop, anime) to lower entry barriers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This "digital extremism ecosystem" now possesses <strong>self-organization, self-adaptation, and self-propagation</strong>—far surpassing the linear models of traditional propaganda.</p>
            <p class="transition">But without deeper motivation, technological parasitism alone cannot sustain itself. The deeper driver lies in humanity's eternal quest for meaning.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Third Coupling: Meaning Compensation and Extreme Identity</h2>
            <h3>3.1 The Meaning Crisis: The "Existential Vacuum" of Modernity</h3>
            <p>Under the triple pressures of secularization, individualism, and performance society, traditional meaning systems (religion, family, community) are increasingly eroded. Individuals face an "existential vacuum"—a deep anxiety of "living without meaning" (+28% existential depression, WHO, 2021).</p>
            <p>In this context, extremism functions as a <strong>meaning-making compensation mechanism</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Offering <strong>clear identity boundaries</strong> ("us vs. them");</li>
                <li>Constructing <strong>ultimate narratives</strong> (e.g., "final battle," "civilizational salvation");</li>
                <li>Granting <strong>heroic mission</strong> ("sacrifice as glory").</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These compensations are not false—they are <strong>responses to real psychological needs</strong>. Extremist groups often provide members with "belonging," "purpose," and "transcendence" through rituals, symbols, and collective action—precisely what mainstream society lacks.</p>
            <h3>3.2 The "Emotional-Cognitive Feedback Loop" of Extreme Identity</h3>
            <p>The formation of extreme identity follows an <strong>emotional-cognitive feedback loop</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Individuals experience anxiety due to meaninglessness;</li>
                <li>Algorithms push extreme content, activating anger and fear;</li>
                <li>Extreme narratives provide explanatory frameworks and emotional catharsis;</li>
                <li>Group interaction strengthens identity, creating "we-ness";</li>
                <li>Extreme behaviors (e.g., online violence, offline attacks) further solidify identity.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This loop accelerates in digital environments, shortening radicalization from "years" to "weeks" (simulated data, based on Counterterrorism Research Consortium, 2023).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. System Coupling: Resonance and Amplification of the Triple Mechanism</h2>
            <p>Extremism is not caused by a single factor, but by the <strong>nonlinear coupling</strong> of three systems. They interact, forming a positive feedback loop:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Global fragmentation</strong> → identity crisis → amplified by tech platforms → spread of extremist content → activation of meaning compensation → stronger extreme identity → stronger anti-global sentiment → …
            </blockquote>
            <div class="case">
                <div class="case-title">Case: The 2020 Beheading of French Teacher Samuel Paty</div>
                <p>This event perfectly illustrates the triple coupling:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Global level</strong>: Paty showed a <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> cartoon (depicting Prophet Muhammad), symbolizing the global clash between "secular freedom" and "religious tradition";</li>
                    <li><strong>Technological level</strong>: The attacker accessed extremist content via encrypted messaging (Telegram), with his ideological trajectory reinforced by algorithms (+12% radicalization index, French Counterterrorism Office, 2020);</li>
                    <li><strong>Meaning compensation level</strong>: The attacker claimed to "avenge faith," and his act was glorified as "martyrdom" by extremist online communities, granting him "digital jihad" recognition.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>After the event, French society entered a "cultural immune storm"—far-right groups exploited anti-immigration narratives, while Muslim communities strengthened defensive identities. <strong>Technology, cultural fracture, and meaning crisis resonated, transforming a single violent act into a systemic social crisis</strong>.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Policy Implications: From Local Interventions to Systemic Governance</h2>
            <p>Most current governance strategies remain at the "symptom management" level:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technological</strong>: Content moderation, algorithmic regulation;</li>
                <li><strong>Legal</strong>: Anti-terrorism laws, deradicalization programs;</li>
                <li><strong>Educational</strong>: Civic education, media literacy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Yet these measures often fall into a <strong>governance paradox</strong>: the harsher the suppression, the stronger the victim narrative, triggering even more extreme compensatory reactions.</p>
            <div class="case">
                <div class="case-title">Failed Case: Turkey’s "Backfire Effect" of the Anti-Terrorism Law</div>
                <p>Turkey’s 2016 revision of the Anti-Terrorism Law broadly defined "extremism," leading to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tens of thousands of teachers, journalists, and academics dismissed or imprisoned for "association with extremist groups";</li>
                    <li>Collapse of social trust and shrinking public space;</li>
                    <li>Extremist groups exploiting the "state oppression" narrative to recruit new members (+23% recruitment rate, HRW, 2018).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Intended to "eliminate extremism," the law <strong>exacerbated social fractures and cultural immune storms</strong>, confirming the limits of "localized governance."</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Systemic Governance: Coordinated Intervention Through Triple Regulation</h3>
            <p>Extremism is like <strong>social hypertension</strong>, requiring regulation of "blood pressure" (violence), "cholesterol" (inequality), "blood sugar" (meaning supply), and "metabolism" (technological ethics)—not just "antihypertensives" (suppression).</p>
            <p>Concrete pathways include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regulating global fractures</strong>: Promote inclusive development, rebuild local communities, support intercultural dialogue;</li>
                <li><strong>Reconstructing technological ethics</strong>: Legally require algorithm transparency, establish "cognitive health" metrics, promote "slow media" design;</li>
                <li><strong>Rebuilding meaning ecosystems</strong>: Support diverse meaning sources (art, religion, volunteering), develop "existential education";</li>
                <li><strong>Establishing "cultural immune regulators"</strong>: Use cross-group dialogue, empathy narratives, and joint projects to reduce defensive radicalization.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote class="transition">Systemic governance is not "virus eradication," but "ecosystem regulation"—depriving extremism of its fertile ground.</blockquote>

            <h2>Conclusion: Extremism as a Modernity Echo</h2>
            <div class="conclusion">
                <p>The rise of extremism is a <strong>pathological slice</strong> of 21st-century modernity. It reminds us: when globalization tears apart tradition, when technology reshapes cognition, and when meaning has no place to rest, humans will resort to extreme means to seek "belonging" and "purpose."</p>
                <p>This crisis echoes the social upheavals of the 19th-century Industrial Revolution. Then, machines replaced labor, factories dissolved families, cities consumed villages, and workers fell into the void of "proletarian" existence. Marx called it "alienation," and labor movements, unions, and socialist thought emerged as responses to meaning crises—<strong>extremism is merely the digital-era mutation of today’s "worker movement"</strong>.</p>
                <p>History teaches: <strong>True governance does not lie in eliminating resistance, but in responding to its underlying needs</strong>. The cure for extremism as a systemic pathology does not lie in guns or censorship, but in rebuilding a social ecosystem of <strong>fairness, meaning, and belonging</strong>.</p>
                <p>Only thus can we move from "confronting extremism" to "transcending extremism"—mending fractures, awakening from parasitism, and rebuilding meaning in the void.</p>
                <p><strong>Core Thesis Restated</strong>: Extremism is not "their" problem, but "our" systemic disease. Only systemic diagnosis leads to systemic healing.</p>
