            <h3>II. Transformation of Skill Assessment: Optimization and Limitations of the Hiring Process</h3>
            <p>HackerRank not only has a profound impact on the education sector but also redefines the hiring model for technical talent through its powerful skill assessment tools. By conducting online programming tests and skill assessments, companies can quickly screen candidates that meet their requirements, saving time on tedious resume screening and preliminary interviews. However, despite HackerRank's excellence in assessing theoretical knowledge and algorithmic abilities, the gap between its assessments and real-world work scenarios remains significant.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scoring Algorithms and the Optimization of Hiring Processes</strong>  
                    HackerRank's scoring system evaluates users' programming abilities through multi-layered algorithms, including code correctness, efficiency, readability, and the innovative nature of problem-solving. This scoring mechanism not only examines developers' technical levels but also reflects their potential comprehensive abilities in actual projects. Many global tech giants (such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft) use HackerRank as a hiring tool to screen developers worldwide, improving hiring efficiency and diversifying their technical talent pool.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Limitations of Skill Assessment and the Gap with Practical Abilities</strong>  
                    Although HackerRank excels in quantifying programming abilities, its assessment system still cannot comprehensively reflect developers' practical project experience and teamwork capabilities. For instance, code in real projects is often more complex and diverse, requiring considerations of readability, modular design, performance optimization, and other engineering practices. HackerRank's programming challenges are usually timed and standardized, unable to fully reflect developers' performance in complex projects. Therefore, companies need to combine other assessment tools, such as project experience, code reviews, and system design interviews, to avoid over-reliance on HackerRank scores.
