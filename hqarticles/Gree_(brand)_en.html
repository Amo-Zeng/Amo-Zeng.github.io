            <h3>1. From Single Product Intelligence to Full Scenario Coverage: Gree's Smart Home Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>With the rapid development of IoT and AI technologies, smart home has become an inevitable trend in modern life. Gree Electric Appliances, with its strong R&D capabilities and forward-looking strategic vision, has transitioned from single product intelligence to a full-scenario smart ecosystem, creating an interconnected and proactive smart home ecosystem.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core Technology Breakthroughs for Product Intelligent Upgrades</strong><br>
                    Gree has achieved intelligent upgrades in core products such as air conditioners, refrigerators, and washing machines, providing users with more comfortable and energy-efficient living experiences through features like AI voice control, automatic cleaning, and air quality monitoring. For example, smart air conditioners can automatically adjust their operating status based on user habits and environmental changes, and can also be linked with other smart devices for more intelligent home management.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Self-developed IoT Platform to Build Interconnected Ecosystem</strong><br>
                    To break down barriers between different brands and categories of devices, Gree has developed the "Gree+" app and a smart cloud platform. Users can easily control all smart devices in their homes through their phones or voice assistants and achieve scenario-based linkage. For example, in "Home Mode," when the smart door lock is opened, lights, air conditioners, and music will automatically adjust to create a warm home atmosphere.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Expanding Product Lines to Provide Full-scenario Solutions</strong><br>
                    Gree is not limited to traditional home appliances but also actively develops product lines such as smart security, smart lighting, and smart curtains. It offers smart home solutions tailored to different scenarios, such as smart living rooms, smart kitchens, and smart bedrooms, providing users with a comprehensive smart living experience.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, Gree Electric Appliances also faces challenges such as user experience, data security, and ecosystem coordination in the smart home field. In the future, Gree will continue to strengthen technological innovation, improve user experience, and build a win-win smart home ecosystem through open cooperation, truly achieving the leap from "Smart Home" to "Smart Life."</p>

            <h3>2. From Green Manufacturing to Green Living: Gree's Path to Sustainable Development</h3>
            <p>Against the backdrop of global climate change and resource scarcity, green development has become an inevitable path for sustainable corporate growth. Gree Electric Appliances has proactively integrated green concepts into every aspect of its business, from "green manufacturing" to "green living," creating a unique path to sustainable development.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Green Manufacturing: Practicing Environmental Principles from the Source</strong><br>
                    Gree Electric Appliances fully implements green environmental principles in product design, manufacturing, and logistics. For example, Gree's self-developed "Cold Outside Unit" series air conditioners use advanced variable-frequency technology and eco-friendly refrigerants, far exceeding national first-level energy efficiency standards, effectively reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions. Additionally, Gree actively promotes smart manufacturing by building digital and intelligent factories, significantly improving production efficiency and reducing resource waste and environmental pollution.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Green Living: Empowering Green Living Spaces with Technology</strong><br>
                    Gree Electric Appliances not only practices green principles in manufacturing but also strives to create green, healthy, and comfortable living environments for consumers. Its full range of home appliances are designed and produced according to green environmental standards, and through IoT and AI technologies, Gree builds a green smart home ecosystem. For example, Gree's "Green Air Conditioner" is not only energy-efficient and environmentally friendly but also adjusts indoor air quality intelligently, providing users with a healthy living environment.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Challenges and Opportunities: The Future of Green Development</strong><br>
                    Although Gree Electric Appliances has achieved significant success in green development, it still faces challenges such as technical barriers, cost pressures, and consumer awareness. In the future, Gree will continue to increase investment in green technology research and development, promote technological innovation, and strengthen collaborative cooperation across the industrial chain to drive the green transformation of the entire industry. For example, Gree plans to further reduce the carbon footprint of the entire industrial chain by co-building green supply chains with suppliers.

            <h3>3. From World Factory to Global Brand: Gree's Global Transformation</h3>
            <p>In the wave of global economic integration, Chinese manufacturing is striving to shed the label of "World Factory" and move towards becoming a global brand. In this process, Gree Electric Appliances, through technological innovation, brand building, and cultural output, has become a model of Chinese enterprise globalization.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technological Innovation: From Imitation to Overcoming</strong><br>
                    Gree's globalization journey is not merely about product exports but is led by technological innovation to build core competitiveness. Through continuous R&D investment, Gree has achieved a leap from technological imitation to global leadership in the air conditioning industry. For example, its self-developed "Dual-Stage Superheat Variable Frequency Compressor" technology has broken foreign technological monopolies and led industry technological changes.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Brand Building: From OEM to Independent Brand</strong><br>
                    Gree Electric Appliances understands that only internationalization with an independent brand can truly grasp market discourse. By actively participating in international exhibitions, sponsoring international events, and conducting precise brand marketing, Gree's "Gree" brand has been registered in over 160 countries and regions, becoming a trusted air conditioning brand worldwide. For example, Gree successfully increased its brand awareness globally by sponsoring events like the World Cup.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Output: From Product Export to Value Export</strong><br>
                    Gree's globalization is not limited to product and technology exports but also extends to the globalization of corporate culture and values. By setting up production bases overseas, respecting local cultures, and fulfilling corporate social responsibilities, Gree has established a good image of Chinese enterprises as responsible and reputable. For example, the production base Gree established in Brazil not only created numerous job opportunities for locals but also actively supported local social welfare initiatives.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although Gree's globalization journey has achieved significant success, it still faces challenges such as international trade frictions and global economic uncertainties. In the future, Gree needs to continue to adhere to independent innovation to enhance product competitiveness; strengthen brand building to increase brand value; and deepen localized operations to build a global value network.</p>
