            <h2>Origin and Historical Evolution of Design Awards</h2>
            <p>The origins of design awards can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution period, when the awards mainly focused on functionality and craftsmanship precision. With the rise of the Bauhaus school in the early 20th century, design began to integrate with art, technology, and craftsmanship, and awards started to emphasize the unification of practicality and aesthetic value. Entering the 21st century, with globalization and digital technology advancements, design awards have become more international and diverse, highlighting the impact of design on society and the environment, reflecting contemporary design's emphasis on social responsibility and cultural integration.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Exchange and International Collaboration through Design Awards</h2>
            <p>Design awards are not just platforms for evaluating design works but also bridges for cultural exchange and international collaboration. Through the establishment of awards and the display of works, design concepts from different countries and regions are able to learn from and spread to each other. For example, Japan's Good Design Award, through its global design open platform, has facilitated the exchange and integration of Eastern and Western design cultures. Design awards also promote international creative cooperation and understanding. By participating in international design competitions, designers and teams can not only enhance their international reputation but also find new creative inspirations and collaboration opportunities in cross-cultural exchanges.</p>
