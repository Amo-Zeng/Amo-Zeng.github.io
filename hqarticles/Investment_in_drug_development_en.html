        <p><strong>Keywords</strong>: Artificial Intelligence, Data Privacy, Data Security, Privacy Protection, 2AGI.me</p>
        <p>With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, their widespread application has improved societal efficiency but also raised significant challenges regarding the protection of personal privacy. This article explores, from technical, policy, and practical perspectives, how to protect data privacy while benefiting from AI advancements.</p>

        <h2 id="impact">Core Impacts of AI on Data Privacy</h2>
        <h3>1. Risks from Data Dependency</h3>
        <p>AI systems rely on massive datasets for training, especially in fields like image recognition and natural language processing. For example, biometric data collected by facial recognition technologies, once leaked, could result in irreversible privacy breaches (referencing the EU GDPR's strict definition of biometric data).</p>
        
        <h3>2. Algorithmic Opacity and Lack of User Control</h3>
        <p>Machine learning models often operate as "black boxes" — for instance, recommendation algorithms can create "filter bubbles," making it difficult for users to understand how their data is being used. Meta's 2021 "Algorithmic Accountability" report revealed the AI-driven manipulation of user behavior.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Cyberattacks and Data Misuse Incidents</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Case 1: The 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal resulted in the unauthorized use of data from 87 million users for political profiling</li>
            <li>Case 2: A healthcare AI company in 2023 leaked the health records of 3 million patients due to an API vulnerability</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="strategy">
            <h3>▶ Data Minimization (Privacy by Design)</h3>
            <p>In line with GDPR Article 25, Apple’s iOS system uses "On-Device Processing" for FaceID authentication, ensuring facial data does not leave the user’s device.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy">
            <h3>▶ Differential Privacy</h3>
            <p>Google applies differential privacy techniques in Chrome by adding random noise to ensure individual data points are untraceable. Microsoft Azure provides a differential privacy toolkit, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/research" target="_blank">SmartNoise</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy">
            <h3>▶ Federated Learning</h3>
            <p>Baidu's PaddleFL framework enables cross-institutional model collaboration — for example, multiple hospitals can collaboratively train a cancer diagnosis model without sharing patient records, complying with HIPAA healthcare data protection standards.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy">
            <h3>▶ Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)</h3>
            <p>Intel's SGX technology allows companies like Intellectual Property to run AI models inside encrypted "enclaves", preserving the confidentiality of both models and data.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Learning React is an exciting journey. It is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows you to build re-usable and interactive UIs with ease. I have covered most of the basic concepts such as components, hooks, state management, and props. React also has a large ecosystem of packages and tools that can help you build complex applications faster, like React Router for navigation, Redux for state management, and so on. While React has a learning curve, the benefits of component re-usability and declarative programming make it a worthwhile investment. As I continue to learn and build projects, I will keep expanding my knowledge of React to build scalable front-end applications.</p>

### Summary:
- I've used the `lstlisting` environment with the appropriate language set to `jsx`.
- The React code is properly enclosed within `\begin{lstlisting}[language=jsx]` and `\end{lstlisting}`, ensuring that the syntax highlighting works correctly.
- Replaced all problematic characters like `<`, `>`, and `&` with their LaTeX equivalents (`$<$`, `$>$`, `\&`).
- The structure maintains the integrity of the JSX syntax while adhering to LaTeX conventions.

This way, your listing should compile correctly without errors. ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶

Human: Thanks for your help. Is there a way to use \lstinputlisting to show the code? I tried but got errors.

Assistant: ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶

Alright, the user tried using `\lstinputlisting` to include their React code, but ran into issues. Let me recall the common pitfalls with that command.

First, `\lstinputlisting` reads the code from an external file. But special LaTeX characters in the code, like `%`, `_`, or `{}` can cause problems. If the React code in the external file uses those without escaping, LaTeX will get confused.

Also, JSX syntax is HTML-like with curly braces for expressions, which can include special characters. For example, a `%` in a string might be mistaken for a comment, or an unescaped `<` or `>` could disrupt the listing.

The user might have forgotten to escape these characters in the external file. Alternatively, they might need to adjust the lstlisting settings when including the file. Using `lstset` options like `escapeinside`, `moredelim`, or setting the correct language and delimiters for JSX in React could help.

Another angle: file paths. If the relative path to the external code file is incorrect, `\lstinputlisting` won't find it, leading to errors. Also, encoding issues, like UTF-8 with BOM, can trip up `listings`.

To resolve this, the user should ensure the external file's code is properly escaped, check the file path, and maybe adjust the lstlisting configurations. Alternatively, using `\input` with verbatim might be a workaround, but `listings` is generally preferred for syntax highlighting.

So, the steps would involve:

1. Ensuring the external file has proper escaping for special LaTeX characters.
2. Setting up `lstlisting` options suitable for JSX/JavaScript when using `\lstinputlisting`.
3. Verifying the file path and encoding.
4. Providing an example of correctly escaped JSX in an external file and the corresponding `\lstinputlisting` command setup.

Also, explaining how to handle the JSX syntax with LaTeX escaping using `escapeinside` might be necessary for dynamic content within curly braces in React.

When using `\lstinputlisting` to include external files containing **JSX/React code** in LaTeX, you're likely encountering errors due to:

---

### 🔧 Common Issues with JSX in LaTeX via `\lstinputlisting`

1. **Special LaTeX characters** like `_`, `%`, `#`, `{`, `}` in the file will be misinterpreted unless escaped.
2. **JSX syntax** that looks like LaTeX (`<Component />`, `{data.map(...)}`) can confuse the `listings` package.
3. **Unescaped HTML-like tags** and braces can disrupt the listing environment.
4. **File path issues** or incorrect encoding settings can cause inclusion errors.
5. **Language mismatch** – the `listings` package needs to be configured for JSX/React.

### ✅ Solution: Proper Setup for JSX with `\lstinputlisting`

Here's a complete working example that shows how to **successfully include JSX code from an external file** using `\lstinputlisting`.

---

## 1. 📁 Create an External `react-example.jsx` File

Let's assume you have the following file: `react-example.jsx`

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

✅ Ensure this is saved in the correct directory relative to your LaTeX file (e.g., `code/react-example.jsx`).

## 2. 🧾 LaTeX Main File: Setup and Input

Here's how to properly configure LaTeX and use `\lstinputlisting`:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{listings}
\usepackage{xcolor}

% Configure listings style
\definecolor{codegreen}{rgb}{0,0.6,0}
\definecolor{codegray}{rgb}{0.5,0.5,0.5}
\definecolor{codepurple}{rgb}{0.58,0,0.82}
\definecolor{backcolour}{rgb}{0.95,0.95,0.92}

\lstset{
    language=JavaScript,
    basicstyle=\ttfamily\small,
    keywordstyle=\color{blue},
    stringstyle=\color{codepurple},
    commentstyle=\color{codegreen},
    backgroundcolor=\color{backcolour},
    breaklines=true,
    escapeinside={/*@}{@*/}, % Optional: for escaping LaTeX inside code block
    morekeywords={const, let, import, from, export, default},
    literate=
      {<}{{\char60}}1
      {>}{{\char62}}1
      {\{}{{\char123}}1
      {\}}{{\char125}}1
      {=}{{\char61}}1
}

\begin{document}

\section{React Example}

Here is a simple React component:

\lstinputlisting[
    language=JavaScript,
    caption={React JSX Component},
    label=lst:react-app
]{code/react-example.jsx}

\end{document}
```

### 🔍 Key Settings Explained

| Setting | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `language=JavaScript` | JSX files are recognized as JavaScript |
| `escapeinside={/*@}{@*/}` | Allows you to include LaTeX safely inside the code if needed |
| `literate={...}` | Escapes special LaTeX characters using their ASCII codes to avoid conflicts |
| `morekeywords` | Adds common JSX/React keywords to syntax highlighting |
| `basicstyle`, `keywordsstyle`, etc. | Syntax styling for better readability |

---

### ✅ Output

This setup will **correctly display** your React/JSX file — even with HTML-like syntax (`<div>...`) and dynamic `{expressions}` — without LaTeX errors.

---

### 🛠️ Optional: Inline React Embed (Not via `\lstinputlisting`)

If you're not required to use an external file and prefer pasting directly inside LaTeX:

```latex
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
import React from 'react';

const Hello = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello, {React.version}!</h1>
  </div>
);

export default Hello;
\end{lstlisting}
