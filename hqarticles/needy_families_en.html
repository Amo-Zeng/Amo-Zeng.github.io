            <h2>The Impact of Poverty on Mental Health</h2>
            <p>The impact of poverty on mental health is multi-faceted and mainly manifested in the following aspects:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Economic Stress:</strong> Poor families often face severe economic stress, which affects not only adults but also children, leading to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. Economic stress can lead to long-term mental distress, affecting the quality of life and family relationships. Research shows that long-term economic hardship increases the risk of mental health problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Exclusion:</strong> Poor families often face social exclusion and discrimination, which can exacerbate mental health problems, leading to damaged self-esteem and increased risk of depression and anxiety. Social exclusion can also lead to social isolation, further weakening mental health. Social exclusion not only affects individuals' mental health but also their social interactions and career development.</li>
                <li><strong>Living Environment:</strong> Poor families often live in areas with poor environments, which lack basic infrastructure and social resources, such as medical care, education, and recreational facilities, further exacerbating mental health problems. Poor living environments can lead to chronic stress and increase the risk of mental health problems. Research shows that improving the living environment can significantly enhance mental health levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Education and Job Opportunities:</strong> Children from poor families often lack good educational opportunities, putting them at a disadvantage in their future career development, further exacerbating mental health problems. The lack of education and job opportunities can lead to long-term economic hardship, further affecting mental health. The lack of education and job opportunities not only affects individuals' mental health but also the economic development of the entire community.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Impact of Mental Health Issues on Poverty</h2>
            <p>Mental health issues are not only a result of poverty but also a cause of it. Mental health issues exacerbate poverty through the following ways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Employment Ability:</strong> Mental health issues affect an individual's employability and job performance. People with mental health issues often find it difficult to maintain stable employment, further exacerbating economic hardship. Decreased employability can lead to long-term unemployment or low income, increasing economic stress. Research shows that mental health issues are a significant factor leading to unemployment and low income.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Expenses:</strong> The treatment of mental health issues requires substantial medical expenses, which is a heavy burden for poor families. Increased medical expenses further exacerbate economic stress. High medical expenses can lead families into debt crises, further exacerbating poverty. Research shows that medical expenses are a significant factor leading to poverty.</li>
                <li><strong>Family Relationships:</strong> Mental health issues affect family relationships, leading to family conflicts and disputes. The deterioration of family relationships can further exacerbate mental health issues, forming a vicious cycle. The deterioration of family relationships can lead to family breakups, increasing the risk of mental health issues. Research shows that the deterioration of family relationships is a significant factor leading to mental health issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Support:</strong> Mental health issues affect an individual's social support network, leading to social isolation. Social isolation can further exacerbate mental health issues, forming a vicious cycle. Social isolation can lead individuals to lose social support, increasing the risk of mental health issues. Research shows that social support is a significant factor in improving mental health levels.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Innovative Methods of Technology in Poverty Reduction</h2>
            <p>In the era of globalization and rapid technological development, technological advancements provide new opportunities and innovative methods for poverty reduction. These methods can not only directly improve the quality of life for the poor but also promote long-term economic and social sustainability.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mobile Technology and Financial Inclusion:</strong> The proliferation of mobile technology offers unprecedented opportunities for the poor. Through smartphones and mobile internet, residents in poor areas can access more information and resources. For example, the successful application of mobile payment technology like M-Pesa in Kenya has enabled those without bank accounts to conduct financial transactions conveniently, increasing financial inclusion and promoting local economic development. Research shows that the proliferation of mobile technology has significantly increased economic activity levels in poor areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Agriculture and Productivity Enhancement:</strong> Digital agriculture, through big data, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, helps farmers improve efficiency and productivity. For example, agricultural sensors can monitor soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient content in real-time, helping farmers optimize irrigation and fertilization strategies. Additionally, agricultural big data platforms can provide market information and price predictions, helping farmers make more informed decisions. Research shows that the application of digital agriculture technology has significantly improved agricultural productivity and farmers' income.</li>
                <li><strong>Telemedicine and Health Improvement:</strong> Telemedicine technology enables residents in poor areas to access high-quality medical services through the internet and video calls. For example, some villages in Africa use telemedicine platforms to communicate in real-time with city hospital doctors, receiving timely medical advice and treatment plans, improving the accessibility of medical resources and reducing patients' medical costs. Research shows that the application of telemedicine technology has significantly improved the level of medical services in poor areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Online Education and Skill Enhancement:</strong> Online education platforms provide rich educational resources and learning opportunities for students in poor areas through the internet. For example, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) platforms like Coursera and edX offer a large number of free, high-quality courses covering various aspects from basic education to vocational skills training, helping students improve their academic level and providing them with job skills, increasing employment opportunities. Research shows that the application of online education platforms has significantly improved educational levels and employment rates in poor areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Clean Energy and Sustainable Development:</strong> Energy scarcity is one of the major challenges faced by many poor areas. Clean energy technologies such as solar and wind power provide sustainable energy solutions for poor areas. For example, some villages in India have gained stable electricity supply through solar panels, improving residents' quality of life and reducing environmental pollution, promoting sustainable development. Research shows that the application of clean energy technology has significantly improved the quality of life and environmental protection levels in poor areas.</li>

            <h2>Diversified Solutions through Community Participation</h2>
            <p>Community participation, as a new pathway for poverty alleviation, mobilizes and stimulates the initiative of community residents, promoting diversified poverty alleviation schemes to achieve sustainable poverty alleviation effects.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Economic Poverty Alleviation:</strong> Providing microloans, skill training, and entrepreneurial guidance to help poor residents increase their income. For example, India's Self-Help Groups (SHGs) help members achieve economic independence through collective borrowing and savings. Research shows that the successful application of self-help groups has significantly improved the economic level of poor residents.</li>
                <li><strong>Educational Poverty Alleviation:</strong> Education is key to escaping poverty. Communities can establish education funds, provide scholarships, and organize educational activities to improve residents' educational levels. For example, the "Children in Distress" organization in Bangladesh provides free education and vocational training to help poor children improve their lives. Research shows that educational poverty alleviation has significantly improved the educational levels and employment opportunities of poor residents.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Poverty Alleviation:</strong> Health issues are a significant cause of poverty. Communities can establish health service stations, conduct health education, and provide medical assistance to improve residents' health status. For example, Ethiopia's Community Health Worker program trains community residents to serve as health workers, providing basic medical services. Research shows that health poverty alleviation has significantly improved the health levels of poor residents.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Poverty Alleviation:</strong> A good living environment is crucial for improving the quality of life. Communities can organize environmental protection activities, improve infrastructure, and promote green development to enhance residents' living environment. For example, Mexico's "Green Community" project improves the community's ecological environment through tree planting, waste sorting, and energy conservation. Research shows that environmental poverty alleviation has significantly improved the quality of life for poor residents.</li>
