                <li><strong>Strengthening environmental governance</strong>  
                    Traditional fossil fuels are the primary sources of environmental pollution and climate change, while the promotion of renewable energy can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. More importantly, energy empowerment grants individuals and communities the right and ability to participate in environmental governance. They can actively engage in environmental protection by choosing clean energy, practicing energy conservation, and promoting the adoption of green lifestyles.</li>
                <li><strong>Expanding social development rights</strong>  
                    Energy is the foundation of social development, and its access and use directly impact people's quality of life and development opportunities. Energy democratization and empowerment can eliminate energy poverty, providing equal opportunities for energy access, improving living conditions, and promoting social equity. For instance, in some developing countries and regions, the promotion of solar power systems provides remote areas with stable and clean electricity, not only improving their quality of life but also enhancing education and healthcare levels.</li>
