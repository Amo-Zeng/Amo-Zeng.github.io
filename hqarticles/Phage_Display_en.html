            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the field of biomedicine, the efficiency of discovering targeted molecules (such as antibodies, peptides, and nanobodies) directly determines the pace of breakthroughs in disease treatment. Traditional methods like hybridoma technology (monoclonal antibody preparation) and SELEX (nucleic acid aptamer screening) face bottlenecks such as long cycles (6-24 months), low throughput, and high costs. Although phage display technology improves in vitro screening efficiency by more than 10 times, it is still limited by library coverage (<10^11 diversity) and the randomness of experimental blind screening. The intervention of artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally changing this landscape—by combining high-throughput experimental data with deep learning to achieve a "virtual screening → experimental validation" closed loop, ushering in an era of "astronomical exploration" in targeted molecule discovery (from "needle in a haystack" to "galactic positioning"). A 2023 study in <i>Nature Biotechnology</i> showed that AI-optimized phage screening protocols can shorten the lead molecule discovery cycle to one-fifth of traditional methods.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Genotype-Phenotype Coupling Mechanism:</strong> Inserting foreign genes into phage capsid proteins (e.g., M13's pIII/pVIII) ensures that expressed peptide segments correspond to the encapsulated DNA.</li>
                <li><strong>Three-Stage Screening (Example: PD-1 Tumor Target):</strong>
                    <pre><code>graph LR
    A[Library Construction] --> B[Biopanning]
    B --> C[Multiple Rounds of Enrichment]
    C --> D[High-Throughput Sequencing]</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Key Parameters:</strong> Library capacity (10^8-11), mutation rate (5-20%), elution stringency (pH/salt gradient).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This AI-driven technological revolution is rewriting the rules of drug discovery: Phage display has evolved from a "molecular microscope" to a "molecular telescope," enabling researchers to directly observe targeted molecules hidden in the vast sequence space. With the maturation of multimodal large models (e.g., AlphaFold3) and automated experimental platforms, the next 5 years may witness the first fully AI-designed, phage-validated original drug entering clinical trials. This paradigm shift not only enhances efficiency but also unlocks new molecular spaces inaccessible to traditional methods, offering breakthrough therapies for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and other challenging conditions.</p>
