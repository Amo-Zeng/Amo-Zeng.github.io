            <h2>Cloud-Native Security Model: Reinventing Enterprise Security Boundaries</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of cloud computing technologies, enterprises are rapidly transitioning to cloud-native architectures to achieve higher flexibility, efficiency, and scalability. However, this transformation brings a series of new security challenges. Traditional boundary-based security strategies are no longer applicable to highly dynamic and distributed environments. Enterprises need to rebuild their security models, creating an autonomous, adaptive cloud-native security system to address the constantly evolving cyber threats.</p>
