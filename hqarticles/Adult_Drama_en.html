            <h2>Theatre: The Container of Time and the Laboratory of Space</h2>
            <p>The theatre, a sanctuary for human spiritual exploration, serves as both a container of time and a laboratory of space. Within this unique domain, the revelry of the body and the labyrinth of identity intertwine to form a complex tapestry. Time, like an invisible thread, runs through it, guiding us across the boundaries of taboo and freedom, leading us to rediscover ourselves within the maze.</p>

            <h3>The Revelry of the Body: Evolution from Taboo to Freedom</h3>
            <p>The revelry of the body has been a significant form of expression since the dawn of human civilization. From the ritual dances of primitive societies to the human sculptures of the Renaissance, from the Bohemian lifestyle to the virtual identities of the digital age, the ways of body expression have evolved, yet the core remains the pursuit of freedom.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ancient Greek Dionysian Festivals:</strong> Naked bodies twirling in the firelight, merging vitality with divinity, created the earliest form of "body revelry".</li>
                <li><strong>Renaissance Period:</strong> Michelangelo's "David" redefined the sacredness and strength of the body, granting a new aesthetic dimension to body revelry.</li>
                <li><strong>Modern Society:</strong> In the Bohemian lifestyle, body revelry transcends traditional expression boundaries through performance art, dance, and theatre.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Age:</strong> The self-portrait culture on social media, body interactions in virtual reality, and AI-generated virtual images are redefining the concept of "body".</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Labyrinth of Identity: Self-Exploration in the Theatre</h3>
            <p>The stage in the theatre is also a microcosm of the labyrinth of identity. This unique space bears the anxieties and quests of modern people for identity. Experimental adult theatre works construct "labyrinths of identity" for us, where we get lost and rediscover ourselves in the process.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Contradiction Between Personal Identity and Social Expectations:</strong> Characters like Dr. Stockmann in "An Enemy of the People" and Wang the Steward in "Teahouse" reflect the fragility of personal identity in the face of societal expectations and the confusion of national self-positioning.</li>
                <li><strong>Identity Anxiety in Modern Theatre:</strong> Characters like Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman" and the protagonists in "Waiting for Godot" reveal deep-seated anxieties about modern identity.</li>
                <li><strong>Existential Atmosphere in the Theatre:</strong> The audience can temporarily shed their daily identity shackles in the theatre and examine the potential self within.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Parables of Time and Space: Prisoner and Observer of Time</h3>
            <p>"Cassandra's Room" pushes the exploration of body and identity into the dimensions of time and space. On stage, Cassandra crouches in the corner, facing the audience, with stacks of clocks filling the room. The ticking sounds are incessant but never in sync. These clocks symbolize the fragmentation and multi-dimensionality of time, slicing the room into countless parallel universes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prisoner of Time:</strong> Cassandra's past, present, and future coexist but are disjointed, making it impossible for her to determine the authenticity of anything, including herself.</li>
                <li><strong>Observer of Time:</strong> Eventually, Cassandra realizes she is not a prisoner but an observer of time. The clocks, memories, and choices collectively weave the web of her life.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion: Seeking the Multiple Possibilities of Life in the Theatre</h3>
            <p>The theatre, as a laboratory of time and space, offers us a unique perspective to examine the revelry of the body, the labyrinth of identity, and the parables of time. Here, body expression and identity exploration intertwine, and the fragmentation and multi-dimensionality of time reveal the multiple possibilities of life. We are both revelers of the body and explorers of the labyrinth of identity, as well as observers of time. On the stage of the theatre, we continuously get lost and rediscover ourselves, dancing on the boundary between taboo and freedom, and seeking the meaning of life in the flow of time.</p>
