    <h1>Artificial Intelligence and Data Science: A Balanced Perspective</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>1. The Role and Limitations of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized modern technology, offering unprecedented capabilities in pattern recognition, data processing, and decision-making. However, despite remarkable achievements, AI is far from perfect. It often lacks common sense, struggles with generalization to new domains, and can amplify biases or misinformation present in training data. These limitations underscore the importance of combining AI with human expertise to ensure responsible and ethical use.</p>

        <h2>2. Statistical Misinterpretations in Scientific Research</h2>
        <p>Many scientific studies misuse statistical methods, particularly when it comes to interpreting p-values. It is commonly assumed that a p-value < 0.05 indicates a “significant” result. However, this interpretation is flawed because p-value alone does not quantify the probability that the result is due to chance or that the hypothesis is true. Misuse of statistical significance can lead to overconfidence in results and the replication crisis in many research fields.</p>
        <p>Researchers often fail to report effect sizes, confidence intervals, and alternative hypotheses, all of which are essential for understanding the practical and theoretical implications of findings. Proper statistical practices, including Bayesian methods and open statistical analysis, are necessary for building robust and reproducible research.</p>

        <h2>3. Interdisciplinary Approaches for AI Advancement</h2>
        <p>Progress in AI cannot be limited to engineers and data scientists. Collaboration across disciplines — from philosophy and ethics to law and medicine — is crucial to address the broader societal and ethical impacts of AI technologies. Interdisciplinary research ensures that AI development aligns with human values and addresses real-world challenges effectively and responsibly.</p>
