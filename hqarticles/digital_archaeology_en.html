            <h2>Digital Archaeology: Development and Challenges from Multiple Perspectives</h2>
            <p>Digital archaeology, as an emerging field of intersection between archaeology and digital technology, has made significant progress in recent years. From the new perspective that "digitalization" is not the end but "dataization" is the key, this article explores the future development direction of digital archaeology, combining virtual reality (VR) technology and the core strength in cultural heritage protection and传承.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Dataization: The Core of Digital Archaeology</h3>
            <p>Traditionally, the main task of digital archaeology is to convert physical materials into digital form. However, if the digitalized data cannot be effectively analyzed and utilized, its value will be greatly reduced. Dataization refers to converting digitalized materials into analyzable and exploitable datasets, extracting valuable information through various algorithms and tools.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition:</strong> Using machine learning algorithms to analyze large-scale databases of pottery shapes can reveal the spread patterns between different cultures.</li>
                <li><strong>GIS Technology and Spatial Analysis:</strong> GIS technology integrates environmental data with site distribution data to analyze the relationship between human activities and environmental changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Multisource Data Fusion:</strong> Integrating different types of archaeological data can build more complex and precise research models.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Virtual Reality Technology: Breaking Temporal and Spatial Constraints, Creating New Archaeological Experiences</h3>
            <p>Virtual reality technology can break the constraints of time and space, creating immersive archaeological experiences. Through VR, researchers and the public can "return" to ancient times and personally experience historical events. This experience not only makes archaeological research more vivid but also provides the public with a new way of learning history.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Immersive Experience:</strong> The most notable advantage of VR technology is its immersive experience, allowing users to fully immerse themselves in a virtual environment, feeling as if they are in an ancient world.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Temporal Educational and Research Tool:</strong> VR technology provides archaeology with a cross-temporal research and educational tool, enabling researchers to conduct multiple experiments and simulations in virtual environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Heritage Protection and Transmission:</strong> VR technology also plays an important role in the protection and transmission of cultural heritage, ensuring that cultural information is preserved permanently.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Cultural Heritage Protection and Transmission: The Core Strength of Digital Archaeology</h3>
            <p>With the continuous advancement of digital technology, the role of digital archaeology is undergoing a fundamental transformation. From a new perspective, digital archaeology is not just a supplementary tool for cultural heritage protection but also a core driving force for promoting its protection and transmission. By establishing digital archives of cultural heritage, developing digital content based on cultural heritage, and exploring the application models of digital technology in cultural heritage protection and transmission, digital archaeology opens up new avenues for the protection and transmission of cultural heritage.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Research Directions: Building Application Models and Standards for Digital Archaeology</h3>
            <p>To fully leverage the core role of digital archaeology in cultural heritage protection and transmission, it is necessary to further explore the application models of digital technology in this field, build standards for cultural heritage digital archives, and develop digital content creation platforms based on cultural heritage.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>As a new research field integrating archaeology and digital technology, digital archaeology is transitioning from a supplementary tool to a core driving force in the digital protection and transmission of cultural heritage. In the future, with the continuous advancement of digital technology and the continuous improvement of application models, digital archaeology will play an even more important role in cultural heritage protection and transmission, contributing to the sustainable transmission of human cultural heritage.</p>
