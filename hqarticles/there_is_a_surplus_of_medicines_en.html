            <h2>Causes and Socio-Psychological Exploration of Drug Overabundance</h2>
            <p>In today's society, drug overabundance has become a multifaceted issue, encompassing socio-psychological, medical management techniques, and global health policies.</p>
            <h3>Over-Medicalization Phenomenon</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consumerism and Medicalization</strong>: In a modern society dominated by consumerism, health issues are often seen as problems that can be quickly resolved by purchasing products.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Psychological Stress</strong>: The fast-paced lifestyle and competitive pressures lead people to seek quick symptom relief through medication.</li>
                <li><strong>Commercialization of the Medical Industry</strong>: Doctors' prescribing behaviors might be influenced by commercial interests, leading to over-medicalization and drug overabundance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Socio-Psychological Impacts of Drug Overabundance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increased Dependency</strong>: Long-term reliance on medication reduces an individual's self-regulatory capacity.</li>
                <li><strong>Drug Waste</strong>: Overproduction and consumption lead to resource wastage and environmental pollution.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Risks</strong>: Improper medication use can lead to drug resistance and side effects.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Application of Intelligent Drug Management Systems (IDMS)</h2>
            <h3>Pharmaceutical Lifecycle Management (PLCM)</h3>
            <p>PLCM aims to manage every phase of a drug's lifecycle from research to disposal, ensuring its quality, safety, and efficacy.</p>
            <h3>Features and Technologies of IDMS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Monitoring</strong>: Through inventory management, usage tracking, and expiration alerts, optimizing drug management.</li>
                <li><strong>Big Data Analysis</strong>: Predicting demand and optimizing inventory management using big data.</li>
                <li><strong>Supply Chain Management</strong>: Optimizing production and distribution through AI and machine learning.</li>
                <li><strong>Blockchain Technology</strong>: Ensuring transparency in drug tracking.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Global Health Policy and Economic Perspectives</h2>
            <h3>The Global Issue of Drug Overabundance</h3>
            <p>In developed countries, drug overabundance leads to resource wastage; conversely, developing countries might face drug shortages.</p>
            <h3>Solutions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Establishing a Global Drug Information Platform</strong>: Using blockchain technology to create a database matching global supply and demand.</li>
                <li><strong>Setting International Standards and Regulations</strong>: Ensuring the quality and efficacy of drug donations.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-stakeholder Cooperation Mechanism</strong>: Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and pharmaceutical companies.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Impact on Global Economics and Health Equity</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resource Optimization</strong>: Reducing waste, lowering costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Dynamic Adjustment</strong>: Balancing supply and demand, reducing price fluctuations.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Equity</strong>: Through drug redistribution, reducing health inequalities due to economic conditions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Comprehensive Solutions and Future Outlook</h2>
            <h3>Psychological Education and Cultural Change</h3>
            <p>Reducing drug dependency through mental health education and altering health perceptions.</p>
            <h3>Integration of Technology and Policy</h3>
            <p>Optimizing drug management with IDMS while promoting drug redistribution and donations through policy.</p>
            <h3>Long-term Health Investment</h3>
            <p>Focusing on disease prevention and improving global health standards.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The issue of drug overabundance requires a comprehensive approach involving socio-psychological, technological management, and global health policy. By reducing dependency through psychological education, optimizing drug lifecycle management with advanced systems, and guiding drug redistribution and use through international cooperation and policy, we can address this complex issue.</p>
