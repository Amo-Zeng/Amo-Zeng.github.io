            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Over the past few decades, Quantitative Easing (QE) has been used as a monetary tool to respond to economic crises. It has not only significantly influenced global financial markets but also had broad effects on socio-cultural aspects, environmental sustainability, and technological innovation. This article delves into how QE drives the prosperity of the art market through increased liquidity, how it shifts towards supporting green investments for environmental sustainability, and how in the context of the digital economy, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) combine with QE to form a more comprehensive economic policy framework.</p>

            <h3>I. QE and the Prosperity of the Art Market</h3>
            <p>Quantitative Easing policy involves the central bank buying government bonds or other securities to inject liquidity into the market, aiming to stimulate economic activity. As market liquidity increases, investors and the affluent have more disposable income, and with traditional investment returns decreasing, artworks become an attractive alternative investment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Liquidity Spillover:</strong> Artworks, due to their uniqueness and historical value, become safe havens for capital. The affluent seek ways to preserve and enhance their assets, and artworks, with their scarcity and irreplaceability, attract significant investments.</li>
                <li><strong>Asset Diversification:</strong> Artworks not only offer potential appreciation but also carry cultural value and social status symbolism, increasing their appeal. Art investment is not just a financial decision but also an accumulation of cultural capital.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This phenomenon has led to a notable rise in art prices and exacerbated wealth concentration and changes in consumption patterns. Artworks are no longer just collectibles but also a lifestyle and an accumulation of cultural capital. However, this prosperity has also financialized the art market, with art transactions increasingly tied to financial markets, affecting the essence of art. Art prices are increasingly influenced by market fluctuations and investment logic rather than their artistic value.</p>

            <h3>II. QE and the Promotion of Green Investment</h3>
            <p>Traditional QE policy focuses mainly on economic stimulation, but with global attention turning to climate change and environmental sustainability, the concept of green QE has emerged:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Green Bond Purchases:</strong> Central banks can buy bonds specifically for environmental projects, reducing their financing costs and supporting industries like renewable energy. Through this method, QE can directly promote the development of a green economy.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjusted Asset Purchase Criteria:</strong> Prioritize buying bonds from companies committed to reducing carbon emissions, guiding capital towards more environmentally friendly enterprises and projects.</li>
                <li><strong>Support for Environmental Technologies:</strong> Through QE, support the research and development of environmental technologies, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and push for the commercialization of new energy technologies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, implementing green QE faces challenges like policy independence, market distortion, and legal and regulatory issues. Central banks need to balance economic stimulus with environmental benefits. Additionally, avoiding greenwashing and ensuring the true green nature of investments is a key issue.</p>
