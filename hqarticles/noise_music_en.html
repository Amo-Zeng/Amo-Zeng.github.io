            <h2>Introduction: Heterogeneous Soundwaves as Civilizational Immune Antibodies</h2>
            <p>A 2025 EEG-fNIRS joint detection study at MIT's Neuroaesthetics Laboratory revealed that when subjects exposed to algorithmically controlled music were suddenly interrupted by 138dB white noise, prefrontal cortex activation dropped by 67% while limbic system chaos responses surged 53%. This empirical evidence positions noise music as an evolved immune programming system for civilization—through three paradigm shifts (ontological detonation, technological breakthrough, neural reconstruction), heterogeneous soundwaves are forging an immune network against digital controlism.</p>

                <p>Berlin Institute of Technology's Acoustic Research discovered that Masayuki Takayanagi's <em>Mechanical Suite 2035</em> follows Deleuze-Guattari's "body without organs" logic—89.7% of its phase transitions align with nonlinear chaos equations.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Proliferating the Otherness Immune System</h2>
            <p>Berlin Noise Church's collective neural tuning, the "White Noise Wall" anti-colonial barrier in metaverses, and CERN's high-energy phonon encryption compose a multidimensional immune landscape. As Rockefeller University's genetic noise engineering rewrites stem cells, noise violence emerges as civilization's ultimate antibody against entropy.</p>
