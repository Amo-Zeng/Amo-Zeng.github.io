            <h2>From "Passive Defense" to "Eco-Symbiosis": The Mission and Challenges of Security Futurologists</h2>
            <p>In today's rapidly changing world, traditional security concepts are becoming increasingly inadequate. In the past, security was often viewed as a remedial measure after a crisis, a reactive response to known risks. However, new security challenges are emerging without cease, from cyberattacks to climate change, from ethical issues in emerging technologies to global political turmoil, all of which are testing humanity's ability to respond. In this context, the concept of security futurologists has come to the fore. They are not only experts in the security field but also strategic thinkers, innovators, and change agents with forward-looking vision, dedicated to predicting potential future security challenges and actively exploring solutions to shape a safer, more sustainable future.</p>

            <h3>I. Predicting and Shaping: The Dual Mission of Security Futurologists</h3>
            <p>The primary task of security futurologists is to predict potential future security challenges. They leverage advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data analysis to deeply mine vast amounts of data, identifying potential security risks. For instance, in the field of cybersecurity, they can predict trends in future cybersecurity threats, analyze the development trajectory of malware, identify new attack methods, and anticipate potential forms of cyber warfare. In the realm of climate change, they study the impact of climate change on the global security landscape, predict the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and assess their potential threats to food security, water security, energy security, and more. In the emerging technology sector, they explore the security and ethical issues brought about by technologies such as quantum computing and brain-computer interfaces, predict scenarios where these technologies might be misused, and evaluate their potential impact on social security and personal privacy.</p>
            <p>Prediction is just the first step; the more important task is how to address these potential security challenges. Security futurologists need to think innovatively, actively explore new solutions, and lead the transformation of the security field. For example, in response to predicted cybersecurity threats, they can develop AI-based automated defense systems, enhance data security using blockchain technology, and build a more robust cybersecurity framework. In addressing climate change, they can incorporate climate change factors into national security strategies, formulate emergency plans for climate adaptation, build climate-resilient infrastructure, and enhance society's ability to withstand climate risks. In the emerging technology sector, they can participate in establishing security standards and ethical norms for emerging technologies, create a sound legal and regulatory framework, and safeguard the development of emerging technologies.</p>

            <h3>II. From "Siloed Defense" to "Eco-Symbiosis": Building a Comprehensive Security Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>Traditional security concepts are akin to silos, with each domain defending its own "territory." Political security, economic security, cultural security, cybersecurityâ€¦ seemingly distinct, yet intertwined with hidden currents. Security measures in individual domains, like dikes built on sand, struggle to withstand the various risks posed by globalization. We need to break free from "siloed thinking" and construct a comprehensive, holistic "security ecosystem" with systems thinking, achieving the transition from "siloed defense" to "eco-symbiosis."</p>
            <p>Building a comprehensive security ecosystem requires breaking down barriers, fostering integration, and achieving win-win cooperation. First, establish a collaborative security emergency response mechanism between government and businesses, breaking down barriers between the public and private sectors, creating an information-sharing platform, and achieving real-time data exchange. Governments can leverage the technological advantages of businesses to enhance risk warning and emergency response capabilities; businesses can utilize government resources to expand the scope of security services. For example, in smart city construction, tech companies can be involved in building the city brain, using AI and big data to monitor and predict the city's operational status in real time, thereby enhancing the overall security level of the city.</p>
            <p>Second, explore the "Security+" model, integrating security concepts into all aspects of economic and social development, building a virtuous cycle where security and development promote each other. In smart city construction, "Security+" means integrating security concepts throughout the entire process of city planning, construction, and operation. For instance, in smart transportation systems, IoT technology can be used to monitor road traffic conditions in real time, identify and address potential safety hazards, ensuring smooth and safe urban traffic. In the digital economy, "Security+" means building a comprehensive cybersecurity protection system, protecting personal information security, maintaining cyberspace order, and safeguarding the healthy development of the digital economy.</p>
            <p>Finally, create a cybersecurity talent ecosystem by integrating resources from universities, enterprises, and research institutions. Universities can collaborate with businesses to offer cybersecurity-related majors, jointly develop talent training programs, and incorporate industry needs into the curriculum. Enterprises can provide students with internship opportunities to enhance their practical skills and professional competencies. Research institutions can conduct cutting-edge cybersecurity research, providing theoretical support and technical backing for talent development.</p>

            <h3>III. From "Passive Defense" to "Proactive Security": The Role and Path of Security Enablers</h3>
            <p>For a long time, when people think of security, they often imagine government-led public safety prevention and control, firefighting, disaster relief, and other grand narratives. Undeniably, governments play a crucial role in maintaining social security, but this does not mean that security is solely the government's responsibility. In today's complex and ever-changing risk society, security is no longer a distant concept "not my business" but a real issue concerning everyone's immediate interests.</p>
            <p>The "passive defense" model is no longer effective in addressing the security challenges of the new era. Traditional security concepts tend to place individuals in the role of being protected, relying on external forces for security. However, this model has obvious limitations: on the one hand, government resources are limited and cannot comprehensively cover all security domains; on the other hand, individuals remain in a state of dependency for a long time, with generally weak safety awareness and skills. Once faced with emergencies, they are often caught off guard, leading to greater losses.</p>
            <p>We need "security enablers" to drive the transformation of security from "passive defense" to "proactive security." "Security enablers" are individuals dedicated to enhancing personal and social security capabilities. They empower individuals and organizations to identify risks, respond to threats, and resolve crises through education and training, technical support, and platform building, transforming them from "protected individuals" to "security builders."</p>
            <p>Security enablers can adopt multiple paths to achieve their goals. First, develop a security education curriculum tailored to different groups, creating engaging and practical security education programs for children, adolescents, the elderly, professionals, and other groups, integrating safety awareness and skills into daily life. Second, explore gamified learning methods to enhance the appeal and effectiveness of security education, using gamified learning and virtual reality technologies to design immersive, interactive security education experiences that subtly improve learners' safety awareness and skills. Finally, establish a personal security capability assessment system, providing personalized security improvement plans. Assess individuals' cognitive levels and response capabilities in various security domains through questionnaires and scenario simulations, offering personalized security enhancement plans based on the assessment results.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The future is already here, with challenges and opportunities coexisting. Security futurologists, builders of comprehensive security ecosystems, and security enablers collectively shoulder the responsibility of predicting and shaping the future. They will lead humanity towards a safer, more sustainable future with forward-looking thinking, innovative spirit, and the courage for change. Let us join hands and work together to usher in a new era in the security field, contributing to building a safer and more harmonious society.</p>
