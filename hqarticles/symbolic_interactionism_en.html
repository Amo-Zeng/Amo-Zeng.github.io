            <h3>Basic Concepts of Symbolic Interactionism</h3>
            <p>Symbolic interactionism is a sociological theory emphasizing how individuals interact with others through symbols (such as language, gestures, expressions) to construct social reality. This theory posits that people's social behaviors are formed through the understanding and interpretation of symbols, which are the foundation of social interaction. In the digital age, the basic theory of symbolic interactionism has been endowed with new connotations, especially when social activities move online, the use of digital avatars becomes a core issue.</p>

            <h3>Digital Avatars as Symbolic Icons</h3>
            <p>In virtual social spaces, digital avatars are not just visual representations of users; they are symbolic icons that represent users' personalities, emotional states, and social identities. For example, in virtual reality role-playing games (RPGs), players choose different characters, costumes, and props to convey their identity recognition and social intentions. These choices not only affect how players interact with other players but also shape the culture and norms of the game community.</p>

            <h3>Case Study: Role-Playing Games (RPGs) in Virtual Reality</h3>
            <p>In virtual reality role-playing games (RPGs), players build communities and cultures through symbolic interaction, a typical example. Players interact with other players through in-game dialogues, task collaborations, battle strategies, etc. These interactions are not only based on game rules but also on players' understanding and creation of symbols. For instance, a player might use specific equipment and postures to indicate their role positioning and social stance, and this use of symbols forms specific cultures and social norms within the community.</p>

            <h3>Brand Symbols and Consumer Identity Construction</h3>

Brand symbols, such as logos, slogans, packaging, and advertising images, are not only visual identification systems of brands but also bridges of emotional connections between consumers and brands.

Consumers purchase and display these brand symbols to convey their identity recognition and social belonging. This process of symbolic interaction is a crucial part of consumers' self-identity construction.</p>
