            <h3>Emotion Measurement: Quantifying Human Emotions</h3>
            <p>Emotions, as one of the most complex experiences of the human mind, have long been difficult to quantify and understand. However, the rapid development of modern technology is changing this status quo, as emotion measurement gradually steps out of the fog of subjective experience and moves towards objective and precise quantification.</p>
            <h4>1. The Complexity of Multi-Dimensional Emotion Measurement</h4>
            <p>Emotions are not a single-dimensional existence but a complex combination of physiological reactions, facial expressions, voice tones, behavioral manifestations, and individual subjective experiences. Traditional emotional classification (such as "happy" and "sad") no longer meets the needs of modern research, requiring deeper exploration in multiple dimensions for emotion measurement.</p>
            <h4>2. Technology-Enabled Tools for Emotion Measurement</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physiological Signals: The Biological Code of Emotions</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Facial Expressions: The Visual Language of Emotions</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Voice Tones: The Acoustic Code of Emotions</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Manifestations: The External Form of Emotions</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Subjective Reports: Self-Interpretation of Emotions</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Future Prospects of Emotion Measurement</h4>
            <p>With advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, emotion measurement will become more intelligent and precise. Future emotion measurement will not only assess individual emotional states but also have applications in mental health monitoring, human-computer interaction optimization, and other fields, helping us better understand ourselves and others.</p>
