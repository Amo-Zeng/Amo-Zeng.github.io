            <p>In the spotlight, where the actors perform with passion, there is a role often overlooked by the audience but crucial to the success of the performance—the stage manager.

            <h3>I. Role of the Stage Manager</h3>
            <p>The stage manager, known as "Stage Manager" in English and often abbreviated as "SM," has a wide-ranging role. From coordinating during rehearsals to real-time scheduling during performances and summarizing and providing feedback after the show, the stage manager is involved in every aspect of theatre production. They are not only a valuable assistant to the director but also the "brain" and "heart" of the entire剧组.</p>
            <p>During rehearsals, the stage manager must record the director's instructions and convey them accurately to the actors and crew. They also coordinate the work of various departments to ensure that stage design, lighting, sound effects, costumes, and other elements are perfectly presented in the performance. During the performance, the stage manager closely monitors the actors' movements, the use of props, and the handling of unexpected situations backstage, ensuring everything runs smoothly on the timeline.</p>

            <h3>II. Core Responsibilities of the Stage Manager</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Organization and Coordination During Rehearsals</strong></li>
                <p>During rehearsals, the primary task of the stage manager is to ensure the director's intentions are accurately communicated to every actor and crew member. They need to document every detail of the rehearsal, including actors' movements,台词's rhythm, and changes in lighting. These records serve as important references during rehearsals and key evidence for future performances.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the stage manager coordinates the work of various departments, ensuring that stage design, lighting, sound effects, costumes, and other elements are fully tested and adjusted during rehearsals. They work closely with prop masters, costume designers, lighting technicians, sound engineers, and other professionals to ensure every detail is perfectly presented in the performance.</p>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Scheduling During Performances</strong></li>
                <p>During performances, the stage manager's work becomes more intense and complex. They need to closely monitor the actors' movements, the use of props, and the handling of unexpected situations backstage, ensuring everything runs smoothly on the timeline. They must be ready to respond to various emergencies, such as an actor falling ill, props breaking, or lighting malfunctions. In such cases, the stage manager must quickly make judgments and take appropriate measures to ensure the performance continues.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the stage manager needs to maintain close communication with the lighting and sound technicians in the front of the house to ensure that lighting and sound changes are synchronized with the actors' performances. They must always pay attention to every detail on stage to ensure each aspect proceeds according to the director's intent.</p>
                <li><strong>Summary and Feedback After Performances</strong></li>
                <p>After the performance, the stage manager's work does not end. They need to summarize the entire performance, noting the highlights and areas for improvement, and provide this feedback to the director and other members of the剧组. This feedback not only helps improve future performances but is also a crucial path for the stage manager's own growth.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the stage manager needs to communicate with various departments in the剧组 to understand their experiences and suggestions during the performance. This information helps improve the剧组's workflow and provides valuable experience for future performances.</p>

            <h3>III. Challenges and Growth of the Stage Manager</h3>
            <p>The work of a stage manager is full of challenges, but it is these challenges that drive their growth.

Second, they need excellent organizational skills and communication techniques to coordinate the work of various departments and ensure every aspect runs smoothly.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the stage manager must have strong psychological resilience to remain calm and focused under high-pressure environments.

            <h3>IV. Future Development of the Stage Manager</h3>
            <p>With the continuous development of the theatre industry, the role of the stage manager is also evolving. Modern stage managers not only need traditional organizational and coordination skills but also need to master more technical means, such as stage management systems (Stage Management System) and programming for lighting and sound effects. These technical means not only improve the efficiency of the stage manager's work but also enable them to better handle complex stage requirements.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, with the increasing inter-disciplinary collaboration, stage managers need to have broader knowledge储备, such as music, dance, and visual arts. This knowledge not only helps them better understand the director's intentions but also allows them to coordinate the work of various departments more effectively.</p>
