            <h2>Healing the Soul in the Urban Jungle</h2>
            <p>In the urban jungle made of steel and concrete, modern humans operate like unstoppable gears, mechanically moving through the fast-paced life. Anxiety, stress, insomnia, and other "modern ailments" silently erode our mental and physical health like invisible shackles. In this never-ending marathon, light music has quietly become a "spiritual vitamin," infusing tired souls with comfort and strength.</p>

            <h3>The Healing Power of Light Music</h3>
            <p>Light music provides a sanctuary for the soul with its soothing melodies and gentle rhythms. Studies show that light music can effectively reduce anxiety by lowering cortisol levels. A study by the Cleveland Clinic found that participants' anxiety levels were reduced by an average of 40% with light music.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improved Sleep:</strong> A sleep intervention study in Japan showed that listening to light music for 30 minutes before bed for 30 days reduced participants' sleep onset time by an average of 40% and increased deep sleep time by 35%.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Focus:</strong> Research from Stockholm University confirmed that working in a light music environment extended participants' attention span by 25% and improved work efficiency by 30%.</li>
