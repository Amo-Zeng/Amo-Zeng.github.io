            <h2>Introduction: Technological Evolution and Medical Cognition Subversion</h2>
            <p>In 2024, a Neuralink brain-computer interface recipient described a novel sensory experience: "I perceive Wi-Fi signals like seeing air currents." This liminal state between biological neurology and digital signals forced clinicians to confront a fundamental question: <strong>When the boundary between human and technology dissolves, by what logic should medicine define health and disease?</strong></p>
            <p>From Galen's humoral theory to evidence-based medicine, clinical thinking has always relied on the "natural human body" paradigm. The emergence of cyborg patients is shifting medicine from "defect repair" to "possibility negotiation" - demanding not just technological upgrades, but a radical cognitive revolution.</p>

            <h2>Conceptual Reconstruction: Deconstructing Medicine's Fundamental Propositions</h2>
            <h3>The Collapse and Rebirth of the Body</h3>
            <p>Traditional medicine views the body as a "purely biological entity" where disease means "deviation from natural function." Cyborg technology shatters this ontological presumption:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Material Dissolution:</strong> Neural synapses co-construct cognitive systems with silicon chips (See Donna Haraway's Cyborg Manifesto)</li>
                <li><strong>Temporal Reconstruction:</strong> Gene editing enables genetic code rewriting, transforming "cure" into prospective design</li>
                <li><strong>Agency Shift:</strong> DIY biohackers颠覆希波克拉底誓言中的医患权力关系</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Case Studies: Triple Paradoxes in Clinical Scenarios</h2>
            <h3>Paradox 1: Identity Dislocation in Neuralink Patients</h3>
            <p>DSM-5 diagnostic failures reveal: <strong>Current diagnostic frameworks cannot accommodate technology-mediated subjective evolution</strong></p>

            <h3>Paradox 2: Lifetime Ethical Debt of Gene-Edited Children</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Therapeutic paradox: Intervention-induced resistance vs Non-maleficence principle</li>
                <li>Cross-generational responsibility: Ethical risks spanning generations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Paradox 3: The Autonomous Manifesto of Biohackers</h3>

            <h2>Paradigm Challenges: Deconstruction and Reconstruction of Medical Authority</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Framework Collapse:</strong> Shift from linear thinking to complex systems theory</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Judgment Vacuum:</strong> Case studies of WHO health definition failures</li>
                <li><strong>Power Dynamics Reversal:</strong> 35% of biohackers possess advanced genetic knowledge (MIT study)</li>

            <h2>Framework Construction: Implementation Paths for Post-Human Clinical Thinking</h2>
            <h3>Four Principle Systems:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ontological Elasticity (Technology-Integration/Humanity-Cognition Spectrum)</li>
                <li>Symbiotic Decision Model (Augmentation Technology Impact Matrix)</li>
                <li>Post-Human Narrative Medicine (VR Reenactment of Technological Life History)</li>
                <li>Graded Responsibility System (Risk Weight Model)</li>

            <h2>Conclusion: A New Chapter in Medical Humanism</h2>
            <p>"My chip is my thinking organ" – This statement challenges not just clinical definitions, but heralds a medical paradigm leap. <strong>Post-human clinical thinking embodies guardianship of human possibilities</strong>, anticipating a new Hippocratic Oath for our era.</p>
