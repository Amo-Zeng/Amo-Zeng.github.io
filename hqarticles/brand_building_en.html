            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Brands, once merely the outer layer of products and services, symbolizing certain qualities or images, are now undergoing a profound transformation from "concept" to "experience" as times progress and consumer needs evolve. The essence of brands is no longer confined to symbolic expressions but has become a living experience, a new way for users to interact with the world. This article delves into how brands can achieve the shift from "one-way output" to "two-way engagement" by constructing "brand scenes" and "co-creation ecosystems," and how they can crack the "cultural code" through "emotional resonance," ultimately allowing users to "live within the brand" and become part of its culture.</p>

            <h2>From "Concept" to "Experience": Building "Brand Scenes"</h2>
            <p>In traditional brand-building models, brands were more one-way communication tools, where companies attempted to influence consumer purchasing decisions by conveying specific information and values. However, with the rise in consumer awareness and the rapid development of the internet, brands are transitioning from "concept" to "experience." Today, brands are not just symbols of products but also embody culture, environment, and lifestyle.</p>
            <p>The concept of "brand scenes" has emerged, transcending the traditional scope of product display or service provision. It involves meticulously designed scenarios that allow users to personally engage in the lifestyle advocated by the brand. This experience is not limited to purchasing behavior; it permeates users' daily lives, becoming an integral part of their lives and even influencing their decision-making and behavior.</p>
            <h3>Nike's Case</h3>
            <p>Take Nike, for example, which successfully shaped a lifestyle of constantly challenging oneself and pushing boundaries through the slogan "Just Do It." Nike not only conveys this attitude through its products but also creates a "passionate sports lifestyle" scene through various activities, events, and online community interactions. Users not only purchase Nike products but also feel the passion for sports and experience pride and joy as athletes through Nike's platforms.</p>
            <h3>Starbucks' Case</h3>
            <p>Similarly, Starbucks has revolutionized the traditional perception of coffee shops. The "third space" concept created by Starbucks is not just a place to drink coffee but a sanctuary where people can escape the pressures of daily life and enjoy moments of peace and social interaction. Here, coffee becomes a bridge connecting people, and Starbucks' "brand scene" provides an ideal social environment, a place where busy urbanites can find momentary tranquility.</p>
            <h3>NIO's Case</h3>
            <p>NIO further deepens the concept of "brand scenes." As an electric vehicle brand, NIO focuses not only on technological innovation but also on the concept of a "user enterprise," aiming to involve users in the brand's construction and development. Through the unique brand positioning of a "user enterprise," NIO successfully builds a highly loyal user community. In this scenario, users are not just consumers but also part of the brand, experiencing a sense of participation and belonging by participating in activities, providing feedback, and even assisting in promotion.</p>

            <h2>From "One-Way Output" to "Two-Way Engagement": Building "Co-Creation Ecosystems"</h2>
            <p>In the traditional marketing perspective, brands were the carefully crafted "moats" of enterprises, with companies conveying brand concepts and product values to consumers through one-way communication. However, with the development of the internet and the rise in consumer awareness, traditional brand-building models are no longer sufficient to meet the needs of the new era.</p>
            <p>The new perspective of "two-way engagement" has emerged: brands are no longer the sole "moats" built by enterprises but shared value systems co-created by enterprises and consumers. Consumers are no longer mere observers of the brand but participants, contributors, and disseminators. They deeply engage in brand construction, injecting new vitality into the brand and growing alongside it.</p>
            <h3>Xiaomi's Success</h3>
            <p>Xiaomi's success is inseparable from its "participation" marketing model. Xiaomi allows users to participate in various stages of product design, research and development, and improvement through platforms like the MIUI forum and Mi Fan Festival. Users not only provide suggestions for products but also deeply engage in the iterative process, becoming "co-creators" of the product. This deep involvement generates a strong sense of belonging and identity among users, forming a unique "Mi Fan" culture that injects robust vitality into Xiaomi's brand building.</p>
            <h3>LEGO's Success</h3>
            <p>LEGO is not just a toy company but a platform that inspires user creativity. LEGO encourages users to create autonomously and incorporates outstanding user creations into the official product line. For instance, the LEGO Ideas platform gathers creative works from LEGO enthusiasts worldwide, periodically transforming popular creations into official products. This model of integrating user creativity into brand value not only stimulates user participation but also continuously injects innovative vitality into the LEGO brand.</p>
            <h3>Bilibili's Success</h3>
            <p>Bilibili's success is离不开其UGC平台的搭建。B站鼓励用户创作各种形式的内容，并为用户提供了丰富的创作工具和平台资源，让用户能够自由表达自我，分享兴趣爱好。这种UGC模式，不仅为用户提供了展示自我的舞台，也为B站打造了独特的社区文化，吸引了大量的年轻用户，形成了强大的用户粘性。</p>

            <h2>From "Rational Persuasion" to "Emotional Resonance": Cracking the "Cultural Code"</h2>
            <p>In today's highly developed market economy, consumer choices have transitioned from "scarcity" to "abundance." Faced with a plethora of options, consumers no longer merely satisfy their needs based on rational considerations such as function, price, and quality. Instead, they increasingly seek deep emotional connections with brands, looking for spiritual resonance. This shift in consumption trends has prompted brand communication to transition from the traditional "rational persuasion" model to the "emotional resonance" model.</p>
            <p>Traditional brand communication often focuses on the product itself, emphasizing its functions, price, and quality to convey "benefits" to consumers, attempting to persuade them through rational appeal. However, with intensified market competition and upgraded consumer demands, this "benefit-oriented" communication method has gradually revealed its limitations.</p>
            <p>Facing these challenges, brands need to find new communication paradigms, shifting from "benefit-oriented appeals" to "value resonance." By uncovering the "cultural code," brands can establish deep emotional connections with consumers and stand out in the competitive landscape.</p>
            <h3>Jiang Xiaobai's Case</h3>
            <p>Jiang Xiaobai accurately identified the emotional needs of young consumers, who seek individuality and self-expression. It abandoned the traditional "high and mighty" image of liquor brands and instead adopted the expression of "literary youth," telling stories of youth, struggle, friendship, and love. The brand slogan "I am Jiang Xiaobai, life is simple," along with a series of youthful copywriting and marketing activities, successfully resonated with young consumers.</p>
