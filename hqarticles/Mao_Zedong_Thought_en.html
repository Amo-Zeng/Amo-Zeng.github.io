            <h2>Application of Mao Zedong Thought in Contemporary China</h2>
            <p>The mass line and people's stance in Mao Zedong Thought hold a significant place in contemporary Chinese political life. The Chinese Communist Party consistently adheres to the development philosophy centered on the people, ensuring that policy formulation and implementation align with the fundamental interests of the broadest population through extensive consultations and concentration of people's opinions. This mode of political participation not only strengthens the public support base of policies but also enhances their execution efficiency.</p>

            <h3>Application in Economic Policies</h3>
            <p>In terms of economic policies, the spirit of self-reliance and hard work in Mao Zedong Thought has positively driven China's economic development. Confronted with international competition and global economic fluctuations, China persists in independent innovation, promoting industrial upgrading, and achieving a transformation from low-end manufacturing to high-end manufacturing. At the same time, the Chinese government encourages the public to carry forward the spirit of hard work, promoting sustained growth of social wealth through industrious entrepreneurship.</p>

            <h2>Global Spread and Influence of Mao Zedong Thought</h2>
            <p>The influence of Mao Zedong Thought on the international stage is equally significant. In the mid-20th century, many Third World countries were in the state of colonial or semi-colonial status, facing arduous tasks of national independence. Mao's people's war theory, emphasizing guerrilla warfare and protracted war to gradually weaken the enemy's strength under the conditions of enemy superiority and my inferiority, eventually achieving national liberation, had a profound impact on the independence movements of Vietnam, Algeria, Cuba, and others.</p>

            <h3>Application in Socialist Construction</h3>
            <p>In terms of socialist construction, Mao emphasized self-reliance and the mass line, believing that socialist construction should rely on the strength of the masses, mobilizing them to participate in national construction, achieving self-sufficiency. This concept had a positive impact on the socialist construction of many Third World countries. For example, Tanzania's "Ujamaa" movement and Ethiopia's socialist reforms were influenced to some extent by Mao Zedong Thought.</p>

Mao emphasized the combination of practice and theory, advocated a scientific attitude of "seeking truth from facts," and the working method of "mass line." In modern education, Mao Zedong Thought can be better integrated with contemporary educational philosophies through avenues such as practical education, cultivation of social responsibility, stimulation of innovative spirit, and integration of multiculturalism, cultivating a younger generation both profoundly cultured and brimming with innovative vitality.</p>

At the same time, drawing on the concept of mass line in Mao Zedong Thought, educate youth to recognize the close connection between individual growth and social development, cultivating their sense of social responsibility and service awareness.</p>

It not only provides theoretical support for China's political, economic, and social policies but also supplies spiritual impetus for China's development in the new era. While inheriting and promoting Mao Zedong Thought, China also needs to continuously innovate theories and explore practices according to new historical conditions, to ensure the healthy development of the socialist cause.</p>
