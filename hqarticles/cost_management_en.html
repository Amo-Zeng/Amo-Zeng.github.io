            <h2>III. Resource Sharing and Cost Allocation in the Sharing Economy Model</h2>
            <p>The sharing economy model optimizes resource allocation and cost sharing, achieving more efficient economic operation. Typical sharing economy companies include Uber, Airbnb, etc. The core of this model is to reduce costs and improve resource utilization by sharing idle resources.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Improving Resource Utilization</strong>: The sharing economy model improves resource utilization by sharing idle resources (such as cars, houses, etc.). For example, Uber significantly improves vehicle utilization by sharing private cars.</li>
                <li><strong>Reducing Unit Costs</strong>: By sharing resources, fixed costs can be allocated to more users, thereby reducing unit costs. For example, Airbnb reduces the maintenance and management costs of houses by sharing idle houses.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting Sustainable Development</strong>: The sharing economy model promotes sustainable development by reducing resource waste. For example, shared bicycles reduce the use of private cars, reducing traffic pollution.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Pricing</strong>: Sharing economy companies often adopt dynamic pricing strategies, adjusting prices according to demand changes to achieve reasonable cost allocation. For example, Uber adopts a "surge pricing" strategy during peak periods to attract more drivers to participate and share peak period costs.</li>
            </ol>
