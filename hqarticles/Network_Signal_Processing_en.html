            <h2>The Evolution of Network Signal Processing</h2>
            <p>The evolution of network signal processing technology has shifted from the processing of single signals to the fusion processing of multimodal signals. Multimodal signal processing significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of information processing by integrating information from different sensors or signal sources. With the rapid development of information technology, the application of multimodal signal processing in intelligent networks is becoming increasingly widespread, serving as a key technology driving the intelligent process.</p>

            <h3>Cross-Modal Information Fusion</h3>
            <p>Cross-modal information fusion technology significantly improves information processing accuracy by integrating the features of different modal signals. For example, in indoor positioning systems, fusing Wi-Fi signals with radar signals can greatly improve positioning accuracy. Wi-Fi signals, with their high coverage and low cost, perform well in most environments but are easily disturbed in complex environments. Radar signals, on the other hand, offer higher positioning accuracy and better resistance to interference. By integrating these two signals, the system can achieve more precise positioning in complex environments, meeting the demand for high-precision positioning.</p>

            <h3>Inter-Modal Collaborative Optimization</h3>
            <p>Inter-modal collaborative optimization leverages the strengths of different modal signals for information processing. For instance, in environments with low signal-to-noise ratios, using acoustic signals for auxiliary communication can significantly enhance communication reliability. Acoustic signals have high resistance to interference and can provide stable communication support in environments where electromagnetic wave signals are disturbed. By collaboratively optimizing different modal signals, the system can achieve higher communication quality in harsh environments, ensuring reliable transmission of information.</p>

            <h3>Modal Recognition and Conversion Based on Deep Learning</h3>
            <p>The application of deep learning algorithms in the field of signal processing provides powerful tools for the recognition and conversion of multimodal signals. For example, deep learning algorithms can be used to convert voice signals into text signals, achieving efficient speech recognition. In multimodal signal processing, deep learning algorithms can automatically identify the features of different modal signals and perform efficient information conversion, thereby enabling the efficient processing of multimodal signals. The application of this technology not only enhances the efficiency of signal processing but also opens up new avenues for the intelligent processing of multimodal signals.</p>
