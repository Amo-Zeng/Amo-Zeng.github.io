            <h2>Application of Image Segmentation in Art Restoration</h2>
            <h3>Identification of Damaged Areas</h3>
            <p>In the process of art restoration, the first step is to identify the damaged areas. Image segmentation technology can automatically detect cracks, fading, stains, and other damaged parts in the image and separate them from the intact areas. This not only improves the accuracy of identification but also greatly reduces the time and cost of manual intervention.</p>
            <h3>Color and Texture Restoration</h3>
            <p>Image segmentation technology can help identify and separate different color and texture regions, providing accurate references for color and texture restoration. For example, in an oil painting, image segmentation can separate different color regions, making it easier for restorers to perform precise color restoration.</p>
            <h3>Background and Foreground Separation</h3>
            <p>In some artworks, the separation of background and foreground is crucial for restoration work. Image segmentation technology can automatically identify and separate the background and foreground, providing clear visual references for restorers and preventing unnecessary damage to the original image during the restoration process.</p>
            <h3>Multi-Layer Restoration</h3>
            <p>Many artworks have multi-layered structures, such as the multiple layers of paint in a mural. Image segmentation technology can help identify and separate different layers, providing accurate information for the restoration of each layer. This is particularly important for the restoration of artworks with multi-layered structures.</p>

            <h3>Fire Monitoring</h3>
            <p>Fires, especially forest fires, pose a serious threat to ecological environments and human life and property safety. Image segmentation technology can be used to process thermal imaging images, identifying and segmenting fire areas. By real-time monitoring of the fire's expansion, firefighting strategies can be adjusted promptly to reduce the losses caused by the fire.</p>
            <h3>Earthquake Disaster Assessment</h3>
            <p>After an earthquake, rapid assessment of the disaster situation is crucial for rescue work. Image segmentation technology can be used to process drone aerial images, identifying and segmenting the damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructure in the affected areas. By comparing images before and after the earthquake, a disaster assessment report can be quickly generated, providing a basis for rescue decisions.</p>
            <h3>Typhoon Monitoring</h3>
            <p>Typhoons are common natural disasters in coastal areas. Image segmentation technology can be used to process satellite remote sensing images and radar images, identifying and segmenting the cloud systems and rainfall areas of typhoons. By comparing images from different time points, the movement path and intensity changes of typhoons can be monitored, providing data support for disaster warning and prevention.</p>

This is crucial for monitoring and enforcing traffic violations.</p>
            <h3>Pedestrian Detection and Protection</h3>
            <p>Image segmentation technology can also be used for pedestrian detection and protection. By precisely segmenting pedestrians, their behavior and location can be monitored in real-time, predicting potential traffic accidents and issuing timely warning signals. This is important for enhancing pedestrian traffic safety.</p>
            <h3>Road Infrastructure Detection</h3>
            <p>Image segmentation technology can be used for the detection and maintenance of road infrastructure. By segmenting road images, cracks, potholes, and other damage can be identified, helping relevant departments perform timely repairs and maintenance to ensure road safety and smooth traffic flow.</p>
