            <h2>The Revolutionary Changes in Robotics</h2>
            <p>Robotics is undergoing a silent yet profound revolution that will completely reshape the relationship between robots and humans, ushering in an unprecedented era of intelligence. This transformation can be explored in three dimensions: the enhancement of affective computing and empathetic abilities, the fusion of biological intelligence and artificial intelligence, and the construction of cross-domain collaboration and ecosystems.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>I. From "Tools" to "Partners": Enhancement of Affective Computing and Empathetic Abilities</h3>
            <p>For a long time, robots have been regarded as symbols of efficiency, serving as "tools" for humans to conquer nature. However, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, robots are breaking through the limitations of being "tools" and evolving towards the role of "partners." The enhancement of affective computing and empathetic abilities is the core driving force behind this transformation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Current Status:</strong> Most current robot collaboration is based on preset programs and sensor data, aiming to complete specific tasks, making it difficult for robots to understand human emotions and intentions.</li>
                <li><strong>Future:</strong> The breakthrough in affective computing will be key to robots transitioning from "tools" to "partners." By integrating computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and other technologies, robots will be able to perceive, recognize, and respond to human emotions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>II. From "Competition" to "Fusion": The Combination of Biological Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <p>The relationship between humans and machines is not destined to be one of competition and replacement, but rather one of fusion and symbiosis. The combination of biological intelligence and artificial intelligence will open a new chapter in human-machine collaborative evolution.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Current Status:</strong> In sectors such as manufacturing, robots have already demonstrated advantages over humans, but this often overlooks the fact that robots primarily replace repetitive and hazardous work.</li>
                <li><strong>Future:</strong> By leveraging the strengths of biological intelligence, robots will become more intelligent and flexible. The human-machine relationship will no longer be one of competition, but rather one of mutual learning and collaborative progress.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>III. From "Single" to "Diverse": Cross-Domain Collaboration and Ecosystem Construction</h3>
            <p>Traditional robot collaboration is limited to a single domain, but in the future, robots will break through domain barriers and achieve cross-domain collaboration.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Breaking Domain Barriers:</strong> Robots will engage in cross-domain collaboration, such as industrial robots working with agricultural robots to manufacture components for agricultural planting.</li>
                <li><strong>Building Ecosystems:</strong> Cross-domain collaboration relies on a complete robot ecosystem, including modular hardware platforms, open-source robot operating systems, and robot big data platforms.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion: The Future Vision of Robot Collaboration</h3>
            <p>From "tools" to "partners," from "competition" to "fusion," and from "single" to "diverse," robotics is opening a new era. In the future, robots will no longer be simply "tools" for humans but "partners" who will explore the unknown world together with humans and create a better future.</p>
