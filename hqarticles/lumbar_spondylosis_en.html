            <h2>Current Status: Limitations of Traditional Medicine</h2>
            <p>Lumbar disease, as a common chronic condition, has long relied on traditional medical treatments such as medication, physiotherapy, and surgery. Although these methods have played a significant role in alleviating symptoms and restoring function, they still have certain limitations in diagnostic accuracy, treatment effectiveness, and rehabilitation management. Traditional medical approaches often depend on the doctor's experience and subjective judgment, lacking precise data support and personalized treatment plans, which limits the efficiency and effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment.</p>
