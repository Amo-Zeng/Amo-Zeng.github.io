            <h2>Photography: More Than Documentation, an Extension of the Senses</h2>
            <p>From its very inception, photography has never been solely about documenting reality. As a technological medium, it serves more profoundly as an extension of an "embodied cognitive system" — a tool through which humans perceive, understand, and construct reality.</p>

            <h3>Embodiment of Cognition and Media</h3>
            <p>Embodied cognition theory in cognitive science states that cognition does not reside solely in the "black box of the brain," but emerges from the interaction between body and environment. In this sense, technology is not merely an external tool but an "integrated" part of our cognitive processes — a sensory extension.</p>
            <p>Photography exemplifies this concept perfectly: the camera is not just an "eye" capturing the world, but a device for observing, understanding, and even reconstructing it.</p>

            <h3>From Silver Halides to Digital: Transforming the Cognition of Photography</h3>
            <p>Early silver-based photography was often described as "sculpting with light," representing a faithfully recorded version of nature. However, with the development of digital photography and image processing technologies, the "authenticity" of photography is being re-evaluated.</p>
            <p>For instance, the combination of digital sensors and algorithms enables us to "see" invisible spectrums or reconstruct images under low-light conditions. This marks a "super-extended" visual capability through photographic technologies as part of technical senses.</p>

            <h3>Philosophical Significance of Photography: The Medium is the Message</h3>
            <p>In the words of media theorist Marshall McLuhan, "the medium is the message." Photography is not a neutral carrier of content; it actively shapes the way we perceive and interpret reality.</p>
            <p>A photograph does not simply reflect the world — it participates in constructing it. It is not a copy of reality, but rather an interpretation of it.</p>
