            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The 20th century was an era of汹涌澎湃的世界革命浪潮, with the drastic turmoil of the global political landscape profoundly affecting the foreign policies of various countries. Against this backdrop, Mao Zedong's diplomatic thought, characterized by its distinctive "revolutionary romanticism," shaped the unique foreign strategy and international image of the newly established People's Republic of China. This thought not only crystallized the wisdom of idealism and realism but also embodied the revolutionary sentiments of "anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism" and the strategic choices of the "Third World." As an extension of domestic politics, Mao's diplomatic policies were deeply imprinted with the traces of internal political struggles, making his diplomatic practices both distinctly Chinese and reflective of the times.</p>
            <p>In the new historical conditions, Mao Zedong's diplomatic thought is not only a valuable legacy of Chinese diplomacy but also provides important wisdom and inspiration for contemporary Chinese diplomacy.</p>

            <h3>I. The Symphony of Idealism and Realism: The Deep Integration of Revolutionary Ideals and National Interests</h3>
            <p>One of the core elements of Mao Zedong's diplomatic thought was the lofty ideal pursuit of "the great unity of the world's people." He firmly believed that world revolution was an irresistible historical trend, and that people of all nations would eventually break free from oppression and exploitation through revolution, marching towards a harmonious world. This idealistic pursuit is vividly reflected in Mao's many diplomatic statements. For example, he called for "the international proletariat to unite" and advocated for the establishment of a new world free from imperialism and hegemonism. This ideal not only inspired China's own revolutionary cause but also provided spiritual motivation for the anti-imperialist and anti-hegemonic struggles in the international community.</p>
            <p>However, Mao's diplomatic thought was not purely utopian idealism but was closely intertwined with realistic considerations of national interests. In the early days of the People's Republic, facing isolation and blockade from the international community, China urgently needed to break this situation to safeguard national security and economic development. Therefore, Mao demonstrated a high degree of flexibility in his diplomatic practices. For instance, during the Korean War, China chose to ally with the Soviet Union to counter the military threat from the United States; after the Sino-Soviet split, China turned to support the "Third World" countries to expand its international survival space. This realistic choice allowed China's diplomatic policies to pursue revolutionary ideals while safeguarding national interests, reflecting the deep integration of idealism and realism.</p>

            <h3>II. The "Three Worlds" Theory: Reconstructing the Discourse of International Politics</h3>
            <p>The "Three Worlds" theory is an important component of Mao Zedong's diplomatic thought and a masterpiece of discourse construction. In the 1970s, as the Cold War格局越发复杂, the bipolar rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union dominated the international political discourse体系. However, Mao敏锐地意识到传统的国际政治话语体系已经无法准确反映世界格局的变化,也无法为中国争取更大的发展空间.</p>
            <p>In this context, Mao proposed the "Three Worlds" theory, dividing the world into three parts: the first world consisted of the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union; the second world included developed countries like Europe and Japan; the third world encompassed the vast majority of developing nations. This theory broke away from the traditional "two camps" division, emphasizing the importance of developing countries and gaining more discourse power for China on the international stage. Through this theory, China not only found its own place in international affairs but also successfully enhanced its influence in the international community, laying the foundation for later multilateral diplomacy.</p>

            <h3>III. "Ping Pong Diplomacy" and "Using a Small Ball to Move a Big Ball": The Wisdom of Non-Traditional Diplomacy</h3>
            <p>In the realm of international political博弈, not all discourse power争夺 takes place on the negotiation table. Mao deeply understood this and cleverly employed non-traditional diplomatic means, represented by "Ping Pong Diplomacy," to convey China's voice to the world and shape its international image.</p>
            <p>In 1971, the 31st World Table Tennis Championships were held in Nagoya, Japan. The Chinese table tennis team was invited to participate and engaged in friendly exchanges with the U.S. team. Mao敏锐地捕捉到了这一事件,将其视为中美关系破冰的契机,并果断决策邀请美国乒乓球队访华.这一事件被称为"乒乓外交",也被誉为"小球推动大球".通过这一非传统外交手段,中美两国成功打破了长期的对峙局面,为后来的中美关系正常化奠定了基础.这一事件不仅展现了毛泽东在外交实践中的创新精神,也彰显了中国外交的灵活性与智慧.</p>

            <h3>IV. "Independence and Autonomy" and "Non-Alignment": The Inheritance and New Challenges of Contemporary Chinese Diplomacy</h3>
            <p>Mao's era of "independence and autonomy" was one of the core principles of Chinese diplomacy. This policy emphasized the independence of the nation in international affairs, opposing any foreign interference to ensure that China could make independent judgments based on its national interests and international situation. Mao's "independence and autonomy" thought was particularly important during the Cold War, helping China break free from Soviet influence and establish an autonomous diplomatic route.</p>
            <p>In contemporary times, "independence and autonomy" remains an important principle guiding Chinese diplomatic practices. However, with the deepening of globalization and the complexity of the international landscape, this principle faces new challenges. Globalization has deepened mutual dependence among nations, and unilateral actions can often trigger连锁反应. How China can maintain "independence and autonomy" while avoiding isolation in the international community has become an important issue in the new era. At the same time, how to promote multilateral cooperation and actively participate in global governance on the basis of "independence and autonomy" is also a question that Chinese diplomacy needs to deeply consider.</p>

            <h3>V. "Hiding our Capabilities and Biding our Time" and "Making Positive Contributions": The Transmission of Strategic Wisdom</h3>
            <p>Mao's diplomatic policies experienced a shift from "leaning to one side" to "two lines." In the early days of the People's Republic, faced with the blockade of the Western bloc led by the United States, China adopted a "leaning to one side" policy, fully aligning with the Soviet camp to counter U.S. hegemony. However, as Sino-Soviet relations deteriorated, Mao adjusted the foreign policy, adopting a "two lines" strategy, opposing both U.S. hegemony and Soviet interference, forming an independent diplomatic route. This shift not only reflected the flexibility and adaptability of Chinese diplomacy in complex international situations but also provided historical lessons for the later "hiding our capabilities and biding our time" and "making positive contributions" strategies.</p>
            <p>The contemporary Chinese diplomatic strategies of "hiding our capabilities and biding our time" and "making positive contributions" have similarities with Mao's era of shifts. "Hiding our capabilities and biding our time" emphasizes avoiding excessive exposure and maintaining a low profile to accumulate strength when the country's strength is relatively weak; "making positive contributions" involves actively participating in global affairs and playing a greater international role when the country's strength increases. This strategic shift is both an inheritance of historical experience and a response to the current international situation. In the new era, China needs to maintain strategic定力 to avoid being swayed by the complex international situation, and also needs to show responsibility and commitment at critical moments, contributing Chinese wisdom and solutions to global governance.</p>

            <h3>VI. Transcendence and Innovation: Chinese Diplomacy in the New Era</h3>
            <p>Mao Zedong's diplomatic thought laid a solid foundation for Chinese diplomacy, but times are changing, and the international situation is constantly evolving. In the new historical conditions, Chinese diplomacy needs to go beyond certain specific practices of Mao's era to meet new challenges.</p>
            <p>First, globalization and technological progress have greatly increased the complexity of international affairs. China needs to focus more on innovation in international cooperation, promoting the reform of the global governance体系 to adapt to the new international landscape. Second, as the world's second-largest经济体, China needs to actively participate in the resolution of global issues, such as climate change, public health, and cybersecurity, while safeguarding its own interests, to promote the construction of a more inclusive and equitable international order.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Mao Zedong's diplomatic thought is a valuable legacy of Chinese diplomacy, with its principles of "independence and autonomy," "non-alignment," and strategic shifts in response to international situations providing important enlightenment for contemporary Chinese diplomacy. In the new historical conditions, Chinese diplomacy needs to inherit these thoughts while combining them with the new characteristics of globalization, promoting the innovation and development of diplomatic policies. By balancing "independence and autonomy" with "win-win cooperation," "non-alignment" with "multilateralism," and "hiding our capabilities and biding our time" with "making positive contributions," Chinese diplomacy can achieve the country's long-term interests in the complex international environment and make greater contributions to the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind.</p>
