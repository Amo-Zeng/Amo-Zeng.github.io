            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of wireless communication technology, the scarcity of spectrum resources and the increasingly complex electromagnetic environment have become critical bottlenecks in improving communication system performance. Multi-User Detection (MUD) technology, as a breakthrough solution, has evolved from an initial "adversarial" mindset to a "symbiotic" concept, demonstrating the possibility of harmonious coexistence between technology and the environment. This article will explore how MUD technology transitions from "adversarial" to "symbiotic" from the dimensions of spectrum ecology, edge computing and cloud computing, and complex electromagnetic environments, and look forward to its future development direction.</p>

            <h2>I. From "Adversarial" to "Symbiotic": Reshaping Spectrum Ecology</h2>
            <h3>1.1 The "Adversarial" Thinking in Traditional Multi-User Detection Technology</h3>
            <p>Traditional multi-user detection technology, like a warrior searching for allies amidst chaos, aims to extract useful information from dense interference signals and maximize the efficiency of spectrum resource utilization. However, this "adversarial" mindset views spectrum ecology as a zero-sum game, inevitably leading to resource contention and efficiency bottlenecks. Under this model, competitive relationships between communication systems often result in wasted spectrum resources and decreased communication efficiency.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Spectrum Sharing: Building a Diverse Symbiotic Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>With technological advancements and expanded application scenarios, MUD technology began to break free from the "adversarial" framework, constructing a more harmonious "symbiotic" relationship. The emergence of spectrum-sharing technology broke the deadlock of traditional static spectrum allocation, promoting collaborative development between different communication systems. Through spectrum sharing, different communication systems can coexist on the same frequency band, optimizing spectrum resource utilization.</p>
            <p>For example, in urban environments, cellular networks can share spectrum resources with IoT devices, enabling massive connectivity and low-latency communication. In remote areas, broadcast TV signals can be integrated with wireless broadband services, providing local residents with richer information services. This diverse symbiotic spectrum ecosystem not only enhances spectrum utilization efficiency but also lays the foundation for building a smarter, more inclusive networked society. By enabling spectrum sharing, MUD technology not only maximizes spectrum resource efficiency but also promotes collaborative development among communication systems, achieving efficient resource sharing.</p>

            <h2>II. From "Terminal" to "Cloud": Empowering Edge Computing and Cloud Computing</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Edge Computing: The Key to Real-Time Processing and Resource Optimization</h3>
            <p>With the popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G communication, edge computing has become an essential means to handle massive data processing and real-time requirements. The application of MUD technology in edge computing not only expands its application scenarios but also provides new possibilities for real-time data processing and resource optimization. By deploying MUD algorithms at the edge, systems can perform real-time analysis and processing of collected data, identifying key information and filtering out interference, thereby significantly reducing data transmission pressure.</p>
            <p>In Industrial IoT (IIoT), intelligent transportation, smart cities, and other scenarios, edge devices need to process data from numerous sensors. By deploying MUD algorithms at the edge, real-time analysis and processing of collected data can identify key information and filter out interference, significantly reducing data transmission pressure. For instance, in an intelligent transportation system, edge nodes can use MUD technology to analyze data from different vehicles and sensors in real time, quickly identifying traffic congestion or abnormal events and responding accordingly. This real-time processing capability not only improves system response speed but also reduces data transmission costs, providing technical support for the widespread application of edge computing.</p>
            <h3>2.2 Cloud Computing: The Pillar of Large-Scale Models and Global Optimization</h3>
            <p>Unlike edge computing's local optimization, cloud computing excels in its powerful distributed computing and parallel processing capabilities. In the cloud, MUD technology can construct large-scale models for analyzing complex communication scenarios across regions and platforms, providing more accurate spectrum management and resource scheduling solutions. Through cloud platforms, systems can comprehensively analyze communication data from multiple regions, identifying areas with low spectrum utilization and dynamically adjusting spectrum allocation strategies to achieve global optimization. Furthermore, cloud computing's distributed nature provides support for the expansion of MUD technology. By deploying large-scale MUD models in the cloud, massive data from different terminals and edge nodes can be processed, enabling global optimization.</p>
            <h3>2.3 End-Cloud Collaboration: Model Sharing and System Performance Enhancement</h3>
            <p>The collaborative working mechanism of MUD technology between terminals, edges, and clouds is crucial for creating an efficient communication system. The core of end-cloud collaboration lies in sharing data and models to enhance overall system performance. Technologies such as Federated Learning and Transfer Learning provide new possibilities for end-cloud collaboration in MUD technology.</p>
            <p>At the terminal side, devices can use local data to train MUD models and upload the model parameters to the cloud. The cloud integrates model parameters from multiple terminals to build a more accurate global model and distributes the updated parameters back to the terminals. This end-cloud collaborative approach protects user privacy while improving model generalization. For example, in a smart home system, user devices can train MUD models locally to recognize different users' voice commands, while the cloud integrates model parameters from multiple users to further enhance voice recognition accuracy. Through end-cloud collaboration, MUD technology not only improves overall system performance but also enables secure data sharing and continuous model optimization.</p>

            <h2>III. From "Deterministic" to "Probabilistic": Addressing the Uncertainty of Complex Electromagnetic Environments</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Limitations of Traditional Multi-User Detection Technology</h3>
            <p>Traditional MUD technology typically relies on deterministic models, assuming stable and predictable channel environments. However, in actual wireless communication environments, numerous uncertainty factors exist, such as channel fading, multipath effects, and diverse interference types. These factors make deterministic models insufficient to accurately describe real communication scenarios, leading to degraded detection performance. Faced with these uncertainties, the limitations of traditional MUD technology become apparent, necessitating more flexible models and algorithms to address complex electromagnetic environments.</p>
            <h3>3.2 Introduction of Probabilistic Models</h3>
            <p>To address uncertainty in complex electromagnetic environments, MUD technology needs to transition from traditional deterministic models to more flexible probabilistic models. By introducing probabilistic models and machine learning methods, MUD technology can better handle channel uncertainty, multiuser interference, and the diversity of noise and interference. The introduction of probabilistic models enables MUD technology to better capture dynamic changes in complex electromagnetic environments, improving detection accuracy and robustness.</p>
            <p>For example, Markov models and Hidden Markov Models can be used to model the arrival times, signal strengths, and interference characteristics of multiuser signals. These models not only capture time-varying characteristics of signals but also predict future channel states, enhancing detection accuracy. By introducing probabilistic models, MUD technology can achieve more stable and reliable detection in complex electromagnetic environments.</p>
            <h3>3.3 Application of Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>Machine learning methods, particularly deep learning and reinforcement learning, bring new possibilities to MUD technology. By leveraging vast historical data, machine learning models can adaptively adjust parameters to achieve better detection performance in complex environments. For instance, deep learning uses multi-layer neural networks for nonlinear mapping, automatically extracting feature information from signals. In MUD, deep neural networks can separate individual user signals from received mixed signals. Additionally, reinforcement learning, through interaction with the environment, learns optimal strategies, making it suitable for dynamically changing communication environments. In MUD, reinforcement learning algorithms can dynamically adjust detection strategies based on current channel states and interference conditions, achieving optimal detection performance. By applying machine learning methods, MUD technology not only improves detection accuracy but also enables adaptive optimization in complex environments.</p>
            <h3>3.4 Robust Design</h3>
            <p>In addition to introducing probabilistic models and machine learning methods, MUD technology requires robust design to address various uncertainty factors in complex electromagnetic environments. The goal of robust design is to ensure system stability and reliability under different scenarios. To address channel fading and multipath effects, channel estimation and equalization techniques can be employed, combined with probabilistic models to predict and adjust channel states in real time. Furthermore, robust detection algorithms must consider signal superposition and interference caused by multipath effects, using multipath separation techniques to improve detection accuracy. Through robust design, MUD technology can maintain stability and reliability in complex electromagnetic environments, providing more reliable support for wireless communication systems.</p>
