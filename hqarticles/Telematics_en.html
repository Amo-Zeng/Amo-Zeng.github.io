            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of smart technology, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is redefining our travel methods and transportation ecosystem in unprecedented ways. It is not just about connecting vehicles, but about seamless interaction between people, vehicles, and the environment. Traditional IoV focuses more on "human-centric" approaches, prioritizing driver or passenger safety, comfort, and efficiency. However, with deeper technological applications, IoV is evolving into "scenario-centric," focusing on travel scenarios to provide more personalized and intelligent travel experiences. Simultaneously, IoV is gradually changing the traditional transportation ecosystem from "independent operations" to "collaborative operations," enabling coordination between vehicles, roads, and the cloud, building a smart transportation ecosystem. This article will explore how IoV reconstructs travel experiences through "scenario-centric" approaches and reshapes the transportation ecosystem through "collaborative operations" from multiple perspectives.</p>

            <h3>1. From "Human-Centric" to "Scenario-Centric": The Transition of IoV</h3>
            <p>In traditional IoV applications, the focus is on enhancing vehicle performance and driving experiences. For example, through smart navigation and assisted driving, drivers can better control their vehicles. This mode, centered around "people," emphasizes personal driving safety and comfort, embodying "human-centric" thinking. However, with the integration of IoT, 5G, and artificial intelligence, IoV applications are no longer limited to the vehicle itself but extend to the entire travel ecosystem.</p>
            <p>"Scenario-centric" means that IoV no longer solely serves drivers or passengers but serves the entire travel scenario. Whether traveling from home to work, from the city to the suburbs, or from public transit to shared mobility, IoV can provide customized solutions based on specific travel scenarios. For instance, during peak hours and congested roads, IoV can offer real-time traffic information, recommend optimal routes, or even help users reserve shared mobility tools for seamless multi-modal travel.</p>

            <h3>2. Scenario-Driven Reconstruction of Travel Experiences</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Seamless Multi-Modal Travel</strong>
                    <p>In modern urban life, travel often involves multiple modes of transport. IoV integrates private cars, public transit, and shared bikes into a single platform, enabling seamless multi-modal travel. Users can access real-time traffic information, choose the best travel options, and complete ticketing and parking reservations through mobile apps or in-car systems.</p>
                    <p>For example, when a user needs to travel from home to the airport, the IoV system can recommend the best travel plan based on real-time traffic conditions. If the highway is congested, the system might suggest taking the subway or shared car and reserve the service in advance. Upon arrival at the airport, IoV can also help find parking spaces or provide flight reminders. This seamless integration of multi-modal travel greatly enhances travel convenience and efficiency, offering a new travel experience.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Immersive In-Car Entertainment</strong>
                    <p>With the development of 5G, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR), IoV is transforming car interiors from traditional transportation tools into mobile entertainment centers. Future in-car entertainment will no longer be limited to music, radio, or simple video playback but will become more immersive and personalized.</p>
                    <p>For example, IoV systems can recommend personalized music, movies, or games based on user preferences. During long drives, users can experience virtual travel through AR technology, as if visiting famous landmarks around the world. Additionally, IoV can integrate VR to provide virtual meetings, online shopping, and other applications, turning the car into a multi-functional entertainment platform. This immersive entertainment experience not only alleviates fatigue from long drives but also makes travel more enjoyable and enriching.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Smart Life Services Extension</strong>
                    <p>IoV is not just an extension of transportation tools; it can also serve as a bridge connecting users with various life services. By integrating with smart homes, e-commerce, and dining services, IoV extends life services into the car, offering more convenient life experiences.</p>
                    <p>For instance, during travel, users can remotely control home smart devices through the IoV system, such as adjusting air conditioning temperature, starting the washing machine, or monitoring home security. Moreover, IoV can seamlessly connect with e-commerce platforms and dining services, allowing users to shop or order meals from the car. Imagine being on your way home, and the IoV system automatically reserves dinner for you based on your location and estimated arrival time, even preheating your oven. Such smart life services significantly enhance user convenience.</p>
