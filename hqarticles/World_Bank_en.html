            <h2>Proponent of Digital Finance and Financial Inclusion</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of digital technology, the financial industry is undergoing unprecedented changes. As a leader in the international financial sector, the World Bank has played a key role not only in promoting the development of digital finance but also in advancing financial inclusion.</p>
            <h3>Supporting the Establishment of Digital Payment Systems</h3>
            <p>In many developing countries, the coverage of traditional banking services is limited, leaving a large portion of the population without access to basic financial services. To address this issue, the World Bank actively supports these countries in establishing digital payment systems. For example, by collaborating with local governments and the private sector, the World Bank has helped set up mobile payment platforms, enabling users to transfer money, pay bills, and purchase goods via their mobile phones. This convenient payment method not only enhances the accessibility of financial services but also promotes the development of e-commerce, providing new market opportunities for small and micro enterprises.</p>
            <h3>Providing Microcredit Services</h3>
            <p>Microcredit is an essential component of financial inclusion, providing necessary financial support to low-income households and small and micro enterprises. The World Bank, through partnerships with local financial institutions, has launched various microcredit products, such as agricultural loans, entrepreneurship loans, and consumer loans. These loans typically have lower interest rates and flexible repayment terms, effectively meeting the financial needs of low-income groups. Additionally, the World Bank enhances borrowers' financial literacy through training programs, helping them better manage their finances and improve their repayment capabilities.</p>
            <h3>Promoting Financial Literacy</h3>
            <p>The lack of financial knowledge is a significant barrier to accessing financial services. To address this, the World Bank has launched financial education programs in multiple developing countries, disseminating basic financial knowledge through schools, communities, and online platforms. These programs not only teach how to manage personal finances but also introduce how to identify financial risks and choose appropriate investment products. By improving public financial literacy, the World Bank helps people better utilize financial services to achieve their financial goals.</p>
            <h3>Exploring the Application of Emerging Technologies</h3>
            <p>To further enhance the efficiency and security of financial services, the World Bank actively collaborates with technology companies to explore the application of emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence in the financial sector. For example, blockchain technology can be used to establish transparent and secure payment and transaction systems, reducing fraud and operational risks; artificial intelligence can provide more precise risk assessment and customer management tools to financial institutions through big data analysis. The application of these technologies not only improves the quality of financial services but also provides new impetus for financial innovation.</p>

            <h2>Advocate for Climate Change and Green Finance</h2>
            <p>As global climate change becomes increasingly severe, the demand for green finance is growing. As one of the largest multilateral development institutions, the World Bank plays a crucial role in promoting green finance and supporting countries in formulating and implementing low-carbon development strategies.</p>
            <h3>The Severe Challenges of Climate Change</h3>
            <p>Climate change is one of the most severe global challenges of the 21st century. Frequent extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and ecosystem degradation not only threaten the natural environment but also have a significant impact on the global economy and social stability. Developing countries, due to their weak economic foundations and limited response capabilities, often become the biggest victims of climate change. Therefore, the international community needs to work together to help these countries achieve a low-carbon transition through financial and technological support.</p>
