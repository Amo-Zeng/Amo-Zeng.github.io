            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As one of the most important multilateral development institutions globally, the World Bank has long been seen as the primary provider of development financing. It is dedicated to providing loans and technical assistance to developing countries to help them improve infrastructure, promote economic growth, and reduce poverty. However, with the deepening of globalization and the increasing complexity of global challenges, the functions and roles of the World Bank have undergone significant changes. This article will explore the evolving role of the World Bank from three dimensions: from "development financing" to "global governance," from "unidirectional aid" to "multi-stakeholder cooperation," and from "Western dominance" to "diverse participation," with an in-depth analysis of the challenges it faces and future prospects.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>From "Development Financing" to "Global Governance"</h2>
            <h3>Evolution of the World Bank's Functions</h3>
            <p>The World Bank was initially established to rebuild and recover from the aftermath of World War II, with its primary function being to provide loans and technical assistance to developing countries. However, with the deepening of globalization, the role of the World Bank has gradually expanded, going beyond the realm of "development financing" and more deeply engaging in various aspects of global governance.</p>
            <p>First, the World Bank is not only a provider of funds but also a setter and coordinator of global development agendas. Through cooperation with governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations, the World Bank has promoted a series of development agendas worldwide, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), climate change response, gender equality, and education普及等. These agendas are not just the affairs of a single country or region but are global responsibilities and challenges.</p>
            <p>Second, the role of the World Bank in global governance has become increasingly prominent. In the face of global issues such as climate change, financial crises, and public health crises, the World Bank is no longer just a development financing institution but a key participant in the global governance system. For example, in addressing climate change, the World Bank promotes "green finance" and climate investments to help countries achieve low-carbon transitions; during global financial crises, the World Bank provides emergency loans and policy advice to help stabilize financial markets.</p>
            <h3>The Role of the World Bank in Addressing Climate Change</h3>
            <p>Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing the global community today, and the role of the World Bank in this field is crucial. The World Bank is not only a provider of climate funds but also a promoter of global climate governance.</p>
            <p>First, the World Bank guides significant amounts of funding towards low-carbon and climate adaptation projects through its "Climate Investment Framework." For instance, the "Climate Investment Funds" under the World Bank have provided billions of dollars in financing support for renewable energy projects, energy efficiency improvement projects, and climate adaptation projects in multiple countries worldwide.</p>
            <p>Second, the World Bank's role in global climate governance is reflected in its support and participation in international climate negotiations. The World Bank is an active supporter of the Paris Agreement and plays a significant role in various international climate conferences, helping countries formulate and implement Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and promoting the establishment of global climate financing mechanisms.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the World Bank promotes carbon pricing mechanisms globally through initiatives such as the "Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition," helping countries achieve emission reduction targets. These efforts not only contribute to addressing climate change but also provide important support for the sustainable development of the global economy.</p>
            <h3>The Role of the World Bank in Global Trade and Financial Stability</h3>
            <p>Global trade and financial stability are integral parts of global governance, and the World Bank's role in these areas is equally significant.</p>
            <p>First, in the realm of global trade, the World Bank, through its "Trade & Competitiveness Global Practice," helps countries enhance their trade capabilities and promote balanced development in global trade. For example, the World Bank provides trade policy consultancy and technical assistance to developing countries, helping them integrate into global value chains and improve their export competitiveness.</p>
            <p>Second, in global financial stability, the World Bank, through its "Finance & Markets Global Practice," assists countries in establishing robust financial systems and preventing and responding to financial crises. For instance, during the global financial crisis, the World Bank provided emergency loans and policy advice to several emerging market countries, helping them stabilize their financial markets and avoid economic collapse.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the World Bank promotes political risk insurance for cross-border investments through its "Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency" (MIGA), facilitating the flow of global capital and stabilizing investment environments. This not only helps attract foreign investment but also provides essential support for the stable growth of the global economy.</p>

            <h2>From "Unidirectional Aid" to "Multi-Stakeholder Cooperation"</h2>
            <h3>Limitations of Unidirectional Aid</h3>
            <p>In the past, the relationship between the World Bank and recipient countries was often seen as that of "donor" and "recipient." However, with the evolution of development ideas and changes in the global landscape, this unidirectional aid relationship is being replaced by a multi-stakeholder cooperation model.</p>
            <p>In the traditional aid model, the World Bank, as the primary provider of funds and technology, often held a dominant position. Recipient countries, on the other hand, passively accepted aid, lacking opportunities and capacities to participate in decision-making. While this model could provide necessary resources in the short term, it had significant limitations in the long run:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lack of Sustainability:</strong> Unidirectional aid often fails to stimulate the internal motivation of recipient countries, leading to increased dependency and unsustainable development.</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring Local Needs:</strong> Aid projects are often designed by external experts, failing to fully consider the specific needs and actual conditions of recipient countries, resulting in resource waste and poor outcomes.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Imbalance:</strong> The power imbalance between donors and recipients limits the voice and autonomy of recipient countries, weakening their potential for long-term development.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Necessity of Multi-Stakeholder Cooperation</h3>
            <p>Facing new global development challenges, the World Bank has gradually realized that a single aid model cannot meet the complex development needs. Multi-stakeholder cooperation has become an inevitable choice, with its core principles being:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Joint Decision-Making:</strong> Stakeholders jointly participate in project design, implementation, and evaluation to ensure project relevance and effectiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Sharing:</strong> Integrating resources from various parties, including funds, technology, experience, and human resources, to form synergy and enhance development efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Capacity Building:</strong> Through cooperation, enhancing the autonomous development capabilities of recipient countries, enabling them to independently address future challenges.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The World Bank's Transformation in Practice</h3>
            <p>In recent years, the World Bank has actively explored multi-stakeholder cooperation models in several projects, achieving significant results:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Participatory Budgeting:</strong> In some countries, the World Bank promotes local governments and citizens to jointly participate in budget formulation, ensuring funds are allocated to the most urgent needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Public-Private Partnerships (PPP):</strong> By introducing the private sector, the World Bank has effectively integrated funds and technology in infrastructure development.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue Platforms:</strong> Establishing global and regional dialogue mechanisms to facilitate exchanges and cooperation among governments, civil society organizations, private enterprises, and academic institutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Challenges and Future Prospects</h3>
            <p>Although the multi-stakeholder cooperation model shows great potential, it still faces numerous challenges in practice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interest Coordination:</strong> The diverse goals and demands of different stakeholders make reaching consensus in cooperation a significant challenge.</li>
                <li><strong>Mechanism Design:</strong> Designing effective cooperation mechanisms to ensure the protection of all parties' rights while efficiently advancing project implementation.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Differences:</strong> Cultural differences among countries and regions may affect the smooth progress of cooperation, requiring more intercultural communication and understanding.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the future, the World Bank needs to continue its efforts in the following areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deepening Cooperation Concepts:</strong> Strengthening the promotion and dissemination of multi-stakeholder cooperation models to make them the mainstream approach in global development.</li>
                <li><strong>Improving Cooperation Mechanisms:</strong> Continuously optimizing the design of cooperation mechanisms to ensure effective cooperation among all parties on an equal basis.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Capacity Building:</strong> Providing more capacity-building support to recipient countries and other stakeholders, enhancing their abilities and confidence to participate in cooperation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>From "Western Dominance" to "Diverse Participation"</h2>
            <h3>Current Status and Issues in the World Bank's Governance Structure</h3>
            <p>For a long time, the World Bank, as one of the most important multilateral development institutions, has played a crucial role in promoting global economic growth, eliminating poverty, and supporting sustainable development. However, its governance structure has long been criticized as a typical representation of "Western dominance." For example, the United States holds nearly 17% of the voting rights, granting it a veto power in key decisions. In contrast, developing countries, which are the main recipients of funds and implementers of projects, lack sufficient representation and voice in the governance structure. This unbalanced governance structure not only restricts the legitimacy and effectiveness of the World Bank but also hinders its ability to better serve global development goals.</p>
            <h3>Exploring Change: Initial Attempts at "Diverse Participation"</h3>
            <p>Faced with internal and external pressures, the World Bank has made some positive explorations in governance structure reforms in recent years:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simultaneous Capital Increase and Reform:</strong> In 2010, the World Bank approved a voting rights reform plan, increasing the overall voting rights of developing countries to 47.19%, with China's voting rights rising from 2.77% to 4.42%, becoming the third-largest shareholder after the United States and Japan.</li>
                <li><strong>Establishing More Diverse Decision-Making Platforms:</strong> For example, the establishment of platforms such as the World Bank-IMF Development Committee and the World Bank Group Shareholder Ministerial Council has provided developing countries with more opportunities to participate in decision-making.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Cooperation with Non-Governmental Organizations:</strong> The World Bank has improved the transparency and inclusiveness of its decision-making by introducing external oversight mechanisms and strengthening information disclosure.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Challenges and Dilemmas: Obstacles on the Path to "Diverse Participation"</h3>
            <p>Despite some progress, the reform of the World Bank's governance structure still faces numerous challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Insufficient Reform Motivation:</strong> Developed countries, particularly the United States, remain the largest shareholders of the World Bank with veto power, lacking sufficient motivation to push for reforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Difficulty in Reconciling Interests:</strong> Differences in development concepts and interests among developing countries and between developed and developing countries make it challenging to form a unified reform plan.</li>
                <li><strong>Implementation Challenges:</strong> Some reform measures lack operational feasibility, making it difficult to truly implement them in the World Bank's decision-making and operations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Looking Ahead: Building a More Inclusive, Fair, and Effective Governance Structure</h3>
            <p>Facing these challenges, the World Bank needs to further deepen reforms, building a more inclusive, fair, and effective governance structure to better reflect changes in the global economic landscape and enhance its ability to address global challenges. Specifically, the following measures can be taken:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Further Increasing Voting Rights and Representation of Developing Countries:</strong> Gradually diluting the voting rights of developed countries while increasing the representation of developing countries, making the governance structure more balanced while ensuring decision efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Coordination and Cooperation Among Developing Countries:</strong> Establishing more effective mechanisms to promote the formation of a united front among developing countries in the reform process and enhance their voice.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploring New Governance Models:</strong> For example, introducing more stakeholders into decision-making and establishing more flexible and open governance mechanisms to improve decision transparency and inclusiveness.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>From "development financing" to "global governance," from "unidirectional aid" to "multi-stakeholder cooperation," and from "Western dominance" to "diverse participation," the World Bank is undergoing a profound role reconstruction. This transformation not only reflects changes in the global economic landscape but also signifies the continuous improvement of the global governance system. Although numerous challenges remain in the transformation process, the World Bank's efforts have injected new vitality into global development. In the future, with the deepening of multi-stakeholder cooperation models and further reforms in governance structures, the World Bank will play a more active and significant role in global development, making a greater contribution to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
