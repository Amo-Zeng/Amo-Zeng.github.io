            <h2>Data, Innovation, and Green Transformation: The World Bank Leading Developing Countries Towards a Sustainable Future</h2>
            <p>Under the intertwined influences of globalization and climate change, developing countries are at a critical historical juncture, facing unprecedented challenges and opportunities. As one of the world's largest multilateral development institutions, the World Bank is helping these countries achieve economic transformation and sustainable development through the deep integration of data empowerment, grassroots innovation, and climate-smart development models.</p>

            <h3>I. Data Empowerment: Transitioning from Passive Aid to Active Development</h3>
            <p>In the era of data-driven decision-making, the World Bank is gradually transforming from a traditional "fund provider" into a "data empowerment agent," utilizing its vast data resources and advanced analytical capabilities to provide precise decision-making support for developing countries, helping them transition from passive recipients of aid to proactive leaders in seizing development opportunities.</p>

            <h3>III. Climate-Smart Development: Achieving a Win-Win Path to Green Transformation</h3>
            <p>Facing the severe challenges of climate change, the World Bank is helping developing countries transition to "climate-smart" development models through financial support, technical assistance, and knowledge sharing, promoting a win-win for economic growth and environmental protection.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Data empowerment, innovation, and climate-smart development are the three core forces driving the World Bank's mission to lead developing countries towards a sustainable future. In the future, the World Bank will continue to strengthen its roles as a "data empowerment agent," "innovation supporter," and "green transformation advocate," working hand in hand with developing countries to create a brighter future.</p>
