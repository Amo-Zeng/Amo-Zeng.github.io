            <h3>II. From Linear to Circular: Green Manufacturing Reshaping Business Models</h3>
            <p>Since the Industrial Revolution, the traditional linear economic model characterized by "production-consumption-waste" has driven rapid social progress but also led to severe challenges such as resource depletion, environmental pollution, and climate change. The rise of the circular economy provides new solutions for sustainable manufacturing. The circular economy model follows the closed-loop principles of "reduce-reuse-recycle," emphasizing the recycling of resources and environmentally friendly development.</p>
            <h4>2.1 Ecological Design and Clean Production</h4>
            <p>Green manufacturing spans the entire product lifecycle, from design to production to recycling, systematically reducing resource consumption and environmental pollution. Ecological design requires companies to integrate circular economy concepts into product design, creating products that are easy to disassemble and recycle. For example, Apple has introduced modular designs that are recyclable, reducing electronic waste; IKEA has designed reusable packaging materials to reduce resource waste during transportation.</p>
            <p>Clean production emphasizes reducing resource consumption and pollution emissions at the source. Schneider Electric optimizes production processes through digital technology, achieving higher energy efficiency; Volvo Cars employs green manufacturing processes, reducing carbon emissions during production.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Circular Economy and Emerging Business Models</h4>
            <p>Green manufacturing is not just a revolution in production technology but also a reconstruction of business models. The circular economy provides new ways for companies to create value, spawning emerging business models such as the sharing economy, product-as-a-service, and closed-loop supply chains.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sharing Economy</strong> reallocates idle resources through sharing platforms, reducing resource consumption. Platforms like Mobike and Didi Chuxing improve resource utilization and reduce environmental pollution.</li>
                <li><strong>Product-as-a-Service</strong> extends the product lifecycle, reducing resource waste. Xerox has transitioned from being a printer manufacturer to a "printing service provider," where users pay for printing services as needed, and the company handles equipment maintenance and updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Closed-Loop Supply Chains</strong> maximize resource utilization. Stora Enso has built a closed-loop supply chain for paper products, recycling waste paper and reducing reliance on raw wood.</li>
