            <h2>Introduction: The Triple Collapse of Sovereignty – A Structural Crisis in Global Health Governance</h2>
            <p>The triple convergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate crisis, and digital technological revolution has exposed a deep structural crisis within the World Health Organization (WHO) in global health governance. This crisis transcends superficial narratives of resource scarcity or institutional inefficiency, evolving into a <strong>triple collapse of technological, data, and environmental sovereignty</strong>—a systemic erosion of control over core power dimensions in the global health system: knowledge production, information control, and ecological risk governance. Issues such as mRNA vaccine patent monopolies, private-sector dominance in AI surveillance systems, and institutional fragmentation in climate-health coordination may appear distinct, yet they share a common logic: <strong>the 'publicness' of global public health is being dismantled by private property rights, platform hegemony, and issue silos</strong>. This paper proposes the analytical framework of the "Triple Collapse of Sovereignty," reveals the intertwined governance crisis, and advocates for the <strong>Global Health Sovereignty Commission (GHSC)</strong> as an institutional breakthrough to reconstruct a multilateral governance paradigm centered on publicness.</p>

            <h2>I. Collapse of Technological Sovereignty: mRNA Monopolies and the Dependency Structure of Knowledge Politics</h2>
            <p>The inequitable global distribution of mRNA vaccines is fundamentally an <strong>institutional imbalance in technological sovereignty</strong>. Companies like Pfizer and Moderna rely on the TRIPS framework, using patent barriers and technological opacity (e.g., undisclosed lipid nanoparticle processes) to monopolize core knowledge, reducing promises of "global public goods" to mere rhetoric. The 2022 WTO TRIPS waiver agreement, which only covers finished vaccines and excludes trade secrets and manufacturing processes, exposes the international intellectual property regime's prioritization of <strong>innovation incentives in the Global North</strong>.</p>
            <p>The non-binding design of the COVAX mechanism further entrenches this dependency: the WHO is reduced to a coordinator of corporate "charitable distribution" rather than an arbiter of knowledge production. Pharmaceutical firms cite "regulatory compliance risks" to refuse technology transfer, maintaining a closed loop of "knowledge-capital-power" and rendering Global South countries <strong>technological vassals</strong>—able to access vaccines but not achieve local production.</p>
            <p>The solution lies in reconstructing the logic of knowledge production. This paper proposes a <strong>Global Knowledge Trust (GKT)</strong> mechanism: requiring pharmaceutical companies participating in global procurement to deposit their core patents, process data, and quality control standards into a WHO-administered trust pool, authorizing qualified manufacturers in the Global South under a "non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free" model. This is not only technological democratization but also <strong>sovereign concession</strong>—redefining knowledge from private property to "global public knowledge assets" to break patent hegemony over the right to life. <strong>Case support</strong>: The 2021 mRNA technology transfer hub in South Africa (Afrigen) demonstrated that open technology can significantly enhance local production capacity, though systemic institutional support remains lacking, limiting progress.</p>

            <h2>II. Collapse of Data Sovereignty: Algorithmic Agency and the Privatization of Surveillance Power</h2>
            <p>AI-driven epidemic surveillance is pushing the WHO into the marginal role of an "algorithmic agent." Google Flu Trends (GFT) suffered from data bias, Meta's health data partnerships prioritize commercial agreements, and BlueDot issued early warnings before the WHO but refused to open its algorithms to public institutions—collectively revealing a <strong>systemic transfer of data sovereignty to private platforms</strong>.</p>
            <p>This "reverse dependency" triggers a triple crisis: <strong>algorithmic opacity</strong> undermines scientific verifiability; <strong>data colonialism</strong> forces the Global South to accept models trained on Western user behavior; and <strong>national public health autonomy</strong> is eroded. BlueDot, despite its early warning capability, relies on North American social media data for training, resulting in low sensitivity to outbreaks in Africa and Latin America—a clear manifestation of <strong>geographic bias in technological hegemony</strong>.</p>
            <p>The response is to establish a <strong>Multilateral Algorithmic Audit Mechanism (MAAM)</strong> led by the WHO, mandating third-party audits. Audit standards should cover: data representativeness, model explainability, bias correction mechanisms, and the principle of public interest primacy. Additionally, sovereign states should be granted <strong>data access rights</strong> and <strong>algorithm veto rights</strong> to ensure surveillance systems serve global public health rather than platform profits. Only then can the WHO shift from a "data requester" back to a "technological sovereignty coordinator," preventing data colonialism from becoming the digital extension of neocolonialism.</p>

            <h2>III. Collapse of Environmental Sovereignty: Institutional Nesting Failure and the Climate-Health Governance Divide</h2>
            <p>Cross-cutting risks between climate crisis and public health are increasingly evident: heatwaves increasing mortality, dengue fever spreading to temperate zones, and climate refugees exacerbating disease transmission. Yet, the global governance system suffers from <strong>institutional nesting failure</strong>: the UNFCCC treats health as a secondary issue, climate funds exclude public health projects lacking "carbon benefits," and ambiguous accountability leads to disjointed post-disaster responses.</p>
            <p>This fragmentation is rooted in <strong>issue hierarchies</strong>: climate is categorized as a "development issue," health as a "humanitarian issue," while the "climate-health" nexus lacks an independent agenda and cross-convention integration tools. Despite its technical authority within the UN system, the WHO is reduced to a "technical advisor" in cross-domain negotiations, with its health data failing to serve as a binding constraint in climate decisions.</p>
            <p>Institutional breakthroughs require establishing a <strong>Cross-Convention Health Impact Assessment (CCHIA) mechanism</strong>. All UNFCCC parties should be required to assess the health impacts of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under WHO leadership, making such assessments a precondition for climate fund approval. <strong>Case support</strong>: COP28 marked the first inclusion of health on its agenda, yet lacked mandatory assessment mechanisms. Implementing CCHIA could quantify the marginal health impacts of coal plants on respiratory diseases or deforestation on malaria transmission, "internalizing" health risks as legal costs in climate policy and breaking down the "institutional walls" between climate and health governance.</p>

            <h2>Institutional Innovation Integration: A Unified Reform Pathway via the Global Health Sovereignty Commission (GHSC)</h2>
            <p>The triple collapse shares a common pathology: <strong>the 'publicness' of global health governance is being dismantled by private capital, technological hegemony, and institutional fragmentation</strong>. While individual mechanisms (GKT, MAAM, CCHIA) are targeted, they lack systemic integration. Therefore, this paper proposes establishing a <strong>Global Health Sovereignty Commission (GHSC)</strong> as a permanent, cross-sectoral governance body under the WHO framework to coordinate the three dimensions of sovereignty.</p>

            <h3>GHSC Operational Mechanisms and Feasibility Pathways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mandate & Functions</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Technological Sovereignty Coordination: Manage the GKT to promote public authorization of critical technologies (e.g., mRNA, AI models);</li>
                        <li>Data Sovereignty Oversight: Lead the MAAM to set global ethical and transparency standards for public health AI;</li>
                        <li>Environmental Sovereignty Integration: Implement the CCHIA to incorporate health costs into climate policy assessments.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sources of Authority</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Legal Mandate: Anchor in revisions to the International Health Regulations and the WHO reform agenda to establish treaty legitimacy;</li>
                        <li>Funding Mechanism: Establish a "Global Health Sovereignty Fund" sourced from global health taxes (e.g., air travel tax, digital services tax), a 10% reallocation of climate funds, and G20 special grants;</li>
                        <li>Decision-Making: Adopt a "double majority" system—national voting power weighted by population and health vulnerability, with a scientific committee (including Southern research institutions, ethics scholars, and civil society representatives) holding veto power to balance scientific authority and democratic participation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Feasibility Pathways</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pilot Phase (2025–2027): Establish a GHSC working group under the WHO Emergency Committee to pilot the GKT in African vaccine production;</li>
                        <li>Institutionalization Phase (2028–2030): Formalize GHSC status via a UN General Assembly resolution and integrate it into the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) monitoring framework;</li>
                        <li>Authority Expansion: Gradually gain compliance review and sanction recommendation powers over multinational pharmaceutical and tech platforms, creating a "soft law + hard constraint" hybrid governance model.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion: Rebuilding a Multilateral Governance Paradigm Centered on Publicness</h2>
            <p>The "triple collapse of sovereignty" is not a failure of technology or resources, but a <strong>failure of global justice</strong>. The monopolization of mRNA vaccines, privatization of AI algorithms, and institutional fragmentation between climate and health collectively reveal a systemic erosion of publicness in contemporary global governance. If the WHO continues to play the role of a mere "coordinator," it will inevitably be marginalized. Only by centering <strong>sovereign reconstruction</strong> and promoting the decolonization of knowledge, data, and environment can multilateral health governance regain legitimacy.</p>
            <p>The future global health order must not perpetuate "charitable distribution," "algorithmic agency," or "issue silos," but instead be grounded in a new paradigm of <strong>publicness, equity, and sustainability</strong>. The Global Health Sovereignty Commission is the institutional cornerstone of this paradigm. It calls on us to reaffirm: <strong>the right to life should not be priced by patents, algorithms, or carbon emissions; global health must return to its founding principles of sovereignty, justice, and collective governance</strong>.</p>
