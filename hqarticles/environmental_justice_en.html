            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In today's globalized world, environmental justice is no longer a local issue but a complex topic requiring global cooperation and multi-dimensional thinking. Digital technology, cultural understanding of nature, and corporate environmental responsibility form the three pillars driving environmental justice. This article explores how to achieve sustainable development of environmental justice in a global context by integrating big data, artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), cultural wisdom, and corporate responsibility.</p>

            <h3>Digital Technology and Environmental Justice</h3>
            <h4>Real-Time Monitoring and Analysis</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smart Sensors:</strong> By deploying smart sensors globally, multinational corporations and local communities can monitor environmental changes in real time. These data not only identify pollution sources but also help in protecting cultural heritage and natural resources. For instance, AI algorithms can predict environmental disasters, protecting communities dependent on natural resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Big Data Analysis:</strong> Using big data analysis technology, deep insights into global environmental trends can be gained, providing scientific bases for formulating transnational environmental policies that consider the needs and challenges of different cultural backgrounds.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Community Engagement and Information Transparency</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mobile Platforms:</strong> Develop cross-national application platforms enabling residents from around the world to participate in environmental protection. Such platforms can include cultural educational content to enhance users' cultural understanding and engagement with environmental issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Citizen Science:</strong> Encourage citizens from various cultural backgrounds to engage in environmental monitoring and data analysis, combining local knowledge with global technology to create more diverse environmental solutions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Cultural Understanding and Environmental Practices</h3>
            <p>Cultural diversity plays a crucial role in environmental protection:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Indigenous and Local Knowledge:</strong> Use digital tools to record and disseminate environmental wisdom from indigenous cultures, like climate prediction and ecological protection methods. This knowledge can be shared globally to help multinational corporations and governments develop more localized environmental strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Cultural Exchange:</strong> Promote the exchange of environmental management practices through international collaborative projects. For example, China's "Harmony between Heaven and Man" concept could be integrated with Western environmental science to form unique environmental management strategies.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Multinational Corporations and Environmental Responsibility in Global Supply Chains</h3>
            <p>Multinational corporations are not only engines of economic growth but also key players in environmental protection:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Policies and Implementation:</strong> Corporations should establish and strictly enforce environmental protection policies, introducing smart monitoring systems into their global supply chains to ensure uniformity and transparency in environmental standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Innovation and Collaboration:</strong> Invest in clean technologies and sustainable production. Combining AI and IoT, companies can green their production processes while respecting and integrating local cultural environmental practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal and Policy Support:</strong> International regulations are crucial to ensure that multinational corporations adhere to unified environmental protection standards wherever they operate, protecting environmental justice from commercial interests.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Integration and Practice</h3>
            <p>To achieve globalized environmental justice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Policy and Education:</strong> Governments and educational institutions should promote policy and educational reforms, ensuring that environmental protection policies and technical education consider cultural diversity, fostering composite talents who understand both technology and respect culture.</li>
                <li><strong>Public and Corporate Collaboration:</strong> Through collaborative projects between non-profits and corporations, promote both environmental technology and cultural preservation, ensuring the spread of technology and the continuity of culture.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Incentives and Third-Party Oversight:</strong> Use economic incentives to encourage multinational corporations to adopt environmentally friendly practices, and introduce independent third-party organizations for oversight of environmental behavior to ensure the fulfillment of environmental commitments.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In the context of globalization, achieving environmental justice requires a deep integration of technology and culture, proactive corporate environmental responsibility, and international cooperation and regulation. By applying digital technology, respecting and integrating different cultural environmental wisdom, and through the active role of multinational corporations in global supply chains, we can build a fairer, sustainable environmental protection system. This system not only promotes the sustainable development of the global economy but also ensures that environmental justice becomes a reality for every individual and community, fostering harmony between humans and nature.</p>
