            <h2>From "Shield" to "Spear": The Strategic Transformation of Technological Prosperity</h2>
            <p>For a long time, the concepts of "technological protection of the nation" and "maintaining peace" have been the mainstay of national defense construction, focusing primarily on抵御潜威胁和保障国家安全。However, against the background of accelerating globalization and complex changes in the international situation, traditional defense concepts can no longer meet the needs of the new era. The construction of national defense is gradually shifting from simply "maintaining peace" to a more proactive role as "forging peace," achieving a beautiful turn from "technological protection of the nation" to "technological prosperity of the nation," and a profound revolution from "military-civilian integration" to "military-civilian co-creation."</p>

            <h3>The Strategic Transformation of Technological Prosperity</h3>
            <p>Technology should not be confined to the military field; its powerful spillover effect can also inject strong impetus into the national economic development. For example, the development of chips and operating systems with independent intellectual property rights can not only avoid "getting stuck in the throat" but also drive the development of upstream and downstream industries and form new economic growth points. At the same time, the power of technology can turn "conflict" into "harmony" and build a strong barrier in non-traditional security fields. For example, using big data and artificial intelligence technology to achieve precise prediction and rapid response to public safety incidents, and using satellite remote sensing technology to monitor climate changes and natural disasters in real time. Technological prosperity of the nation means not only the increase in the strength of technology itself but also the deep integration of technology with national development, achieving "killing two birds with one stone."</p>

            <h3>The Profound Transformation of Military-Civilian Co-Creation</h3>
            <p>National defense construction is no longer a solo performance of the state machine but increasingly relies on the joint participation of all sectors of society. The shift from "military-civilian integration" to "military-civilian co-creation" is not just an adjustment at the policy level but a profound revolution in the concept of national defense construction. "Military-civilian co-creation" emphasizes the two-way interaction and joint innovation between the military and civilian forces, promoting military-civilian talent exchange and resource sharing through platforms to stimulate innovation vitality and enhance the overall level of technology. For example, the application of emerging technologies such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence in military training and simulated combat can often lead to revolutionary effects. Through military-civilian co-creation, the optimal allocation of resources can be achieved, innovation vitality can be stimulated, and the comprehensive strength of the nation can be enhanced.</p>

            <h3>The Remodeling and Practice of New Era National Defense Concepts</h3>
            <p>Against the background of accelerating globalization and complex changes in the international situation, the construction of national defense is gradually shifting from simply "maintaining peace" to a more proactive role as "forging peace," playing a more important role in a broader international perspective. Actively participating in UN peacekeeping operations, conducting international military exchanges and cooperation, and using defense technology achievements to participate in the resolution of global issues are all important manifestations of the "forging peace" concept. For example, the Chinese peacekeeping forces deployed in several conflict areas have shown excellent professionalism and humanitarian spirit, bringing peace and stability to the local area and establishing a responsible international image for China. The BeiDou Navigation System not only provides high-precision navigation services for China's military and civilian sectors but also promotes the diversification of the global navigation field by opening up to global users.</p>

            <h3>The New Connotation of "Forging Peace"</h3>
            <p>The concept of "forging peace" integrates national defense construction with maintaining world peace, playing an important role in shaping a peaceful and stable international environment through active participation in international affairs. This shift not only reflects the strategic adjustment of national defense construction in the new era but also showcases the profound historical heritage and global vision of the Chinese nation. From "maintaining peace" to "forging peace," the concepts and practices of China's national defense construction are reaching new heights, contributing Chinese wisdom and strength to the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, the national defense construction in the new era not only needs to maintain national security in the traditional sense but also participate in international affairs more actively, "forging peace" in a broader global perspective, realizing the upgrading of technological prosperity, military-civilian co-creation, and national security concepts. This evolution is not only a deepening of traditional defense concepts but also an active undertaking of global peace and security responsibilities. In the future, with the continuous evolution of the international situation, China will undoubtedly continue to play a more important role on this path, contributing more Chinese solutions to global peace and stability.</p>
