            <h3>Integration of AI and Sampling Techniques</h3>
            <p>In an era driven by data, how to efficiently and accurately collect data has become a core issue. The combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and sampling techniques provides new approaches to address this problem. Through machine learning models, AI can analyze data distribution, predict optimal sampling points, thereby optimizing sampling strategies, reducing sampling bias and data redundancy.</p>
            <h4>Case Study 1: Smart Medical Diagnosis</h4>
            <p>In the field of smart healthcare, AI analyzes patients' genomic data and clinical symptoms to automatically select samples with the highest diagnostic value, significantly improving diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, AI can monitor patients' physiological data in real-time, automatically adjusting sampling frequency to ensure the timeliness and accuracy of data, enhancing the quality and efficiency of healthcare services. For example, using deep learning algorithms, AI can identify potential disease biomarkers, enabling earlier interventions and reducing the risks of misdiagnosis and missed diagnoses.</p>
            <h4>Case Study 2: Environmental Monitoring</h4>
            <p>In environmental science, AI analyzes meteorological data and geographic information to determine the best sampling points, optimizing resource allocation and minimizing ecological disturbance. For example, in forest fire monitoring, AI predicts the likelihood of fires by analyzing meteorological data and forest vegetation data, optimizing sampling strategies to detect fire hazards in time. Additionally, AI can integrate real-time imagery data collected by drones, further enhancing monitoring accuracy.</p>

            <h3>Sampling Techniques and Sustainable Development</h3>
            <p>Against the backdrop of global climate change and resource depletion, sustainable development has become a top priority for nations. Sampling techniques play an indispensable role in this process. Through scientific and systematic sampling, we can better understand environmental issues, make informed decisions, ensuring that the Earth's resources and ecosystems continue to support the flourishing of human society.</p>
            <h4>Case Study 1: Water Quality Monitoring</h4>
            <p>By regularly sampling bodies of water, scientists can detect concentrations of pollutants like heavy metals, chemicals, and organic contaminants, promptly identifying pollution sources and evaluating remediation effects. For instance, setting multiple sampling points in rivers and lakes can map pollutant distributions, guiding pollution control efforts. Further analysis can utilize biomarker techniques to assess the bioavailability of water quality.</p>
            <h4>Case Study 2: Soil Sampling and Agricultural Sustainability</h4>
            <p>By analyzing soil samples for organic matter, nutrient elements, heavy metals, etc., farmers and researchers can develop more precise fertilization strategies, reducing fertilizer use, easing environmental burden, and improving crop yield and quality. Remote sensing and geochemical analysis can further optimize soil sampling strategies, ensuring the representativeness and coverage of sampling points.</p>

            <h3>Citizen Science and Large-Scale Sampling</h3>
            <p>The rise of citizen science has greatly expanded the scope of scientific research. Through large-scale sampling projects, non-professional scientists (i.e., citizen scientists) are actively participating in the process of scientific discovery, pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge.</p>
            <h4>Case Study 1: Climate Change Monitoring</h4>
            <p>Citizen scientists collect meteorological data from communities around the world, filling in gaps that professional scientists find hard to cover, providing rich data support for climate change research. Through smartphone apps and online platforms, citizen scientists can report data in real-time, forming a global climate data network, offering high-resolution climate change maps.</p>
            <h4>Case Study 2: Biodiversity Conservation</h4>
            <p>Through large-scale species recording, scientists have discovered many new species and can monitor changes in ecosystems. For example, in butterfly observation projects, citizen scientists record changes in butterfly populations, helping scientists understand the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. Additionally, using DNA barcoding technology, citizen scientists can provide more precise species identification data.</p>
