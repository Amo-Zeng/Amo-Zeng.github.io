            <h2>The Infrastructuralization of Media Technology: The "Digital Foundations" of Social Movements</h2>
            <p>The proliferation and iteration of media technologies, especially the rapid development of the internet, social media, and mobile communication technologies, have reached unprecedented levels of speed and breadth in information dissemination. These technologies have evolved from being mere tools to becoming the "infrastructure" of social movements. They provide the necessary support and platforms for the organization, mobilization, and dissemination of movements.</p>

            <h3>Technological Empowerment and Decentralization: The Rise of Ordinary Individuals</h3>
            <p>Media technology not only provides infrastructure for social movements but, more importantly, it empowers ordinary individuals to participate in social movements. This technological empowerment breaks the elite-dominated structure of traditional social movements and promotes decentralized forms of movement organization.</p>

            <h3>Mediatization of Emotions and the Construction of Collective Identity</h3>
            <p>Media is not just a tool for information dissemination; it is also the core platform for "emotional mobilization" in social movements. Through visual, linguistic, and narrative strategies, media transforms complex political issues into emotional narratives, stirring public resonance and shaping the collective identity of the movement. However, emotional mobilization is not always advantageous, as it may also lead to emotional polarization, short-sighted behaviors, and goal ambiguity.</p>

            <h3>Demediatization and Remediation: The Dual Effects of Empowerment and Control</h3>
            <p>Demediatization allows participants in social movements to voice their opinions directly, enhancing the autonomy and transparency of the movement and empowering participants. However, remediation reshapes the expression and influence of social movements through algorithmic recommendations, content censorship, and commercial operations, limiting the diversity and inclusiveness of the movement.</p>

            <h3>The Risks of Technological Dependence: The Double-Edged Sword of Media Infrastructuralization</h3>
            <p>Although the infrastructuralization of media technology has brought many conveniences to social movements, its technological dependence also poses potential risks. First, the issue of technological monopoly is becoming increasingly prominent. Large tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Twitter control global information dissemination and social networks, making the mobilization and organization activities of social movements on these platforms easily subject to control and censorship.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The multifaceted roles of media in social movements reflect the complex effects of media technology in the digital era. As the "infrastructure" of social movements, media technology profoundly changes the logic of social resistance through infrastructuralization, technological empowerment and decentralization, emotional mobilization and the construction of collective identity, and the dual effects of demediatization and remediation. However, technological dependence also brings risks such as technological monopoly, algorithmic manipulation, and the depoliticization of social movements. Future social movements need to make full use of media technology while being vigilant against potential crises it brings, ensuring the political nature and social influence of the movement can be sustained. The infrastructuralization of media technology is both an opportunity and a challenge that social movements must face.</p>
