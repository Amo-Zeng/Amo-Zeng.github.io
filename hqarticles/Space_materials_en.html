            <h3>Development and Application of Eco-Friendly Space Materials</h3>
            <p>The development of eco-friendly materials relies on a deep understanding and respect for natural resources. For example, the research and development of bio-based plastics utilize crop waste such as corn stalks and sugarcane residue, which are often considered waste in traditional industries. Through technological means, these wastes are converted into environmentally friendly materials for various uses, such as furniture and building materials. This transformation not only reduces the use of fossil fuels but also alleviates the pressure on landfills, achieving the recycling of resources.</p>

            <h3>Application of Smart Materials in Space Exploration</h3>
            <p>The application of smart materials in the design of space structures has greatly enhanced the adaptability and survivability of spacecraft. For instance, shape-memory alloys can revert to a preset shape based on temperature changes, which is revolutionary for space equipment that requires frequent unfolding and folding. In the deployment of solar sails or space telescopes, this material ensures precision and reliability, reducing reliance on complex mechanical systems.</p>
