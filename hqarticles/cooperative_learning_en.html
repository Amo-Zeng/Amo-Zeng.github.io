            <h3>I. Progressive Collaboration: The Journey from Participant to Leader</h3>
            <p>Collaborative learning is not merely about task distribution and result sharing; it is a journey of deep cognitive and capability enhancement. Progressive collaboration guides students step-by-step from "collaborative participants" to "collaborative leaders" through meticulously designed task sequences. This process is not only about improving collaboration skills but also about shaping thinking depth, innovation capabilities, and leadership.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial Stage: Division of Labor and Foundation Building.</strong> In the early stages of collaboration, tasks are relatively simple, and students experience the initial joy of collaboration through clear division of labor. The core goal of this stage is to help students find their position in the team and gradually develop the awareness of contributing to the team.</li>
                <li><strong>Intermediate Stage: Coordinated Effort and Mutual Improvement.</strong> As collaboration deepens, task complexity increases, and students need to communicate and coordinate at a deeper level, jointly facing complex challenges. The task design at this stage aims to cultivate students' collaborative combat capabilities, enabling them to play a greater role in the team.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Stage: Leading Innovation and Exploring the Unknown.</strong> In the final stage of collaboration, students face more open-ended and creative tasks, requiring them to actively take on the role of leaders and propose innovative solutions. This stage not only tests students' leadership but also enhances their innovative thinking and problem-solving abilities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The core value of progressive collaboration lies in not only helping students complete tasks but also in cultivating their initiative, responsibility, communication and coordination skills, critical thinking, and teamwork spirit through progressively designed tasks. This transformation from participant to leader lays the foundation for students to become outstanding talents with leadership and innovative spirit in future society.</p>

            <h3>II. Interdisciplinary Integration: Breaking Disciplinary Barriers, Cultivating Interdisciplinary Talents</h3>
            <p>In the era of the knowledge explosion, traditional single-disciplinary teaching models can no longer meet the complex demands of future society. Students are confined to their respective disciplinary "islands," unable to integrate knowledge and lacking the ability to address cross-domain issues in the real world. Interdisciplinary collaboration has risen in this context as a key path to breaking disciplinary barriers and cultivating interdisciplinary talents.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Essence and Value of Interdisciplinary Collaboration.</strong> Interdisciplinary collaboration is not simply about adding different disciplinary knowledge but about integrating different disciplinary thinking patterns, research methods, and knowledge systems to form new cognitive frameworks and solutions, driven by solving real-world problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Practical Pathways of Interdisciplinary Collaboration.</strong> Through project-based learning, problem-solving-oriented learning, and interdisciplinary curriculum development, students can apply multidisciplinary knowledge to solve complex problems in real-world contexts. For example, the combination of language and art allows students to enhance language expression and artistic aesthetic abilities while creating picture books; the integration of mathematics and science enables students to apply mathematical models in scientific inquiry, enhancing scientific exploration and mathematical application skills.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Interdisciplinary collaboration not only helps students address complex real-world problems but also promotes deep interdisciplinary cross-integration, giving rise to new disciplinary growth points and creating an open and inclusive learning ecosystem for students.</p>
