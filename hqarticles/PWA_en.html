            <h3>1. Integration and Innovation of PWA with Traditional App Store Models</h3>
            <p>As an emerging application form, PWA combines the advantages of web and native applications, offering users a smoother, faster, and more reliable experience. The integration with traditional app store models not only preserves the user base and trust of app stores but also provides users with more choices and convenience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advantages and Features:</strong> The core feature of PWA lies in its "progressive" nature, allowing for gradual enhancement of user experience. Advantages such as no need for download and installation, offline access, push notifications, and fast loading give PWA significant advantages in user acquisition and retention.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration and Innovation:</strong> App stores can provide integrated services for PWA, allowing users to access and install PWAs directly within the store. Additionally, PWA shortcuts can be added to the desktop or application list, providing an experience similar to native apps. A unified update mechanism also reduces user operations and enhances the user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Model Innovation:</strong> PWA can adopt a subscription model, where users pay monthly or annually for continuous service updates and technical support. Community-driven development and cross-platform integration also bring more innovative possibilities for PWA.</li>
            </ul>
