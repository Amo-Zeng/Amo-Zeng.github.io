            <h2>Symphony of Space and Narrative: Architectural Poetics from Stage to City</h2>
            <p>The theatrical stage and urban space, seemingly two distinct fields, converge into a profound tapestry under the perspective of architectural poetics. The stage is a microcosm of the city, and the city is an expanded stage, both through the construction and deconstruction of architectural language, together composing a symphony of space and narrative. In this symphony, architecture is no longer a static backdrop but an organic part of the narrative, with the fluidity of light and space breaking the inherent boundaries, creating a theatrical and symbolic reality theater.</p>

            <h3>I. Interwoven Realities: Dual Narratives of Stage and City</h3>
            <h4>1. Stage Space: Deconstruction and Reshaping of Architectural Entities</h4>
            <p>The theatrical stage is a world brimming with imagination, where architectural elements are imbued with new life. Traditional architecture seeks stability and permanence, while stage space prioritizes fluidity and multiplicity. Through ingenious design, stage designers liberate architectural elements from their inherent functionality, endowing them with narrative functions. Taking Strindberg's "Miss Julie" as an example, the tilted walls and twisted door frames are not architectural flaws but metaphors for the characters' mental worlds. This "destruction" and "reorganization" of architectural entities breaks the rational framework of traditional architecture, creating a theatrical space rich in symbolic meaning.</p>
            <h4>2. Urban Space: Theatrical Performance of Everyday Life</h4>
            <p>The city is a vast theater, where architectural spaces, through changes in form, light, and material, direct people's emotional experiences and behavioral patterns. Taking Chinese traditional gardens as an example, the design techniques of winding paths and changing views create a poetic spatial narrative, guiding visitors to experience the beauty of nature and the nuances of life. In modern cities, changes in light also serve as the emotional palette of the urban stage. The dawn light on a city square brings hope and vitality, while the dusk envelops it in tranquility and contemplation. Through changes in light and shadow, architectural spaces transform mundane moments of daily life into theatrically charged performances.</p>

            <h3>II. The Magic of Light and Shadow: The Emotional Palette from Stage to City</h3>
            <h4>1. Stage Light and Shadow: The Sculptor of Space</h4>
            <p>On the theatrical stage, light is the most dynamic element of space. It is not merely an illumination tool but a sculptor of space. Through changes in light intensity and color, stage designers can create surreal scenes and evoke a hyper-realistic atmosphere. For instance, in Beckett's "Waiting for Godot," the dim light and desolate set collectively create a sense of absurdity and oppression, echoing the characters' loneliness and despair. The magic of light and shadow elevates the stage space from a physical to a psychological realm, redefining the boundaries of architecture.</p>
            <h4>2. Urban Light and Shadow: The Instant Transformation of Emotions</h4>
            <p>Light in urban spaces also possesses magical effects. In city squares or streets, changes in light can instantly alter the form and atmosphere of buildings, creating different emotional tones. For example, the dawn light on a city square brings hope and vitality, while the dusk envelops it in tranquility and contemplation. Different lighting conditions, akin to theatrical lighting design, transform urban spaces into various stage scenes, influencing people's emotions and interaction patterns.</p>

            <h3>III. The Role as Architecture: Spatial Interaction from Dramatic Characters to Urban Residents</h3>
            <h4>1. Dramatic Characters: Structural Elements of Space</h4>
            <p>On the theatrical stage, the relationship between characters and space is not a simple opposition of background and subject but a complex interaction that intertwines and shapes each other. Dramatic characters, like structural elements of architecture, exist not only to drive the plot but also to support and define the function of the stage space. Taking Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" as an example, the two main characters, Pozzo and Lucky, serve as the pillars of the stage, their dialogues and interactions forming the "beam and column structure" of the entire theater. This dynamic balance is not just a physical layout but a reflection of the psychological space.</p>
            <h4>2. Urban Residents: Narrators of Space</h4>
            <p>Urban residents are the most important "actors" on the urban stage, while architectural spaces provide the "stage" for their "performance." For instance, in a crowded subway car, the forced physical contact among people illustrates the alienation and anxiety of modern cities; while by the window of a café, people leisurely sipping coffee and reading depict a serene and beautiful life. Architectural spaces, through their forms, scales, and materials, influence people's activities and social behaviors, constructing different "theater" scenes.</p>

            <h3>IV. The Architecture of Narrative: Spatial Deconstruction from Stage to City</h3>
            <h4>1. Stage Space: Dynamic Transformation of Narrative</h4>
            <p>The interaction between dramatic characters and architectural space is not a static reflection but a dynamic transformation process. In "King Lear," Lear's anger and madness are externalized through the chaos and turbulence of the stage space, influencing the layout and atmosphere of the space. When he loses his throne and sanity, the stage space shifts from a grand palace to a desolate wilderness. This spatial transformation is not only a symbol of the character's fate but also an externalization of emotions.</p>
            <h4>2. Urban Space: Multi-Layered Narrative Application</h4>
            <p>In urban spaces, the multi-layered application of narrative also provides possibilities for theatrical expression. For example, Paris's sewers are not only escape routes in "Les Misérables" but also symbols of the underclass. The movement of characters within the space not only drives the plot but also critiques the social structure. The layered and complex nature of space enriches and deepens urban narratives.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Infinite Possibilities of Space and Narrative</h3>
            <p>From stage to city, from drama to architecture, the intertwining of space and narrative constructs a reality theater brimming with infinite possibilities. In this theater, architecture is no longer a cold material presence but a narrative space brimming with emotional tension; characters are not just parts of the space but shape its meaning. Through the lens of architectural poetics, we can re-examine the stage and city, sensing the profound integration of art and architecture. Just as architecture is the frozen music, drama is the flowing architecture, together composing a symphony of space and narrative.</p>
