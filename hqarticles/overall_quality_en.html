            <p>The traditional notion of comprehensive quality often simplifies it into static modules like德, 智, 体, 美, 劳, which, while convenient for goal setting, overlook its intrinsic dynamics and evolutionary nature. In a rapidly changing social environment, individuals must continuously adapt to new challenges and opportunities. Therefore, redefining comprehensive quality as a dynamic "self-evolution" engine not only aligns more closely with its essence but also provides a more forward-looking approach to educational practice.</p>
            <h4>德: Dynamic Adaptation of Inner Values</h4>
            <p>The connotation of "德" has shifted from mere moral knowledge传授 to a capability of self-reflection and value adjustment. By continuously examining one's words and beliefs, individuals can adjust their moral standards according to the demands of social development and personal growth stages.</p>
            <h4>智: The Capacity for Lifelong Learning</h4>
            <p>The connotation of "智" has expanded from knowledge accumulation to a capacity for lifelong learning. In the age of information explosion, students not only need to grasp fundamental theories but also must possess the ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and knowledge.</p>
            <h4>体: Holistic Health Management</h4>
            <p>The role of "体" in comprehensive quality has also undergone profound transformation, expanding from mere physical exercise to holistic health management capabilities.</p>
