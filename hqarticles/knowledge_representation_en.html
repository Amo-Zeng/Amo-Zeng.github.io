            <h2>The Future of Knowledge Representation: From Humanization to Dynamic Evolution, From Single Modality to Cross-Modality Fusion</h2>
            <p>Knowledge representation, serving as a bridge between human cognition and machine understanding, is of great significance. For a long time, research on knowledge representation has primarily focused on the construction and maintenance of static knowledge bases, systematizing human knowledge in the form of graphs, rules, and ontologies for storage and management. However, with the continuous development of cognitive science and artificial intelligence technology, the limitations of traditional static knowledge representation have gradually become apparent: lacking dynamism and adaptability, it struggles to effectively respond to complex and ever-changing external environments and the dynamic evolution of human cognition.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>I. Humanization of Knowledge Representation: From Cold Symbols to Warm Cognition</h3>
            <p>Traditional methods of knowledge representation, such as mathematical formulas, logical reasoning, and abstract concepts, are precise and rigorous but often fail to resonate with people. They resemble cold, symbolic towers, simplifying and abstracting the complex real world, yet also disrupting the connection between knowledge and human emotions and experiences. This predicament has become even more pronounced in the age of artificial intelligence: advanced algorithms can efficiently process vast amounts of data but struggle to understand human emotions and intentions; rational knowledge can answer questions but fails to touch the heart.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emotional Connection:</strong> Knowledge representation should emphasize the expression and resonance of emotions, making abstract knowledge more concrete through storytelling, emotional design, and scenario simulation, making it easier to understand and accept.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive Experience:</strong> Knowledge representation should take into account human cognitive characteristics and learning habits, providing a more friendly and intuitive interactive experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Value Guidance:</strong> Knowledge representation should not only focus on information transmission but also emphasize value guidance, helping learners establish correct worldviews, outlooks on life, and values.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>II. Dynamic Evolution of Knowledge Representation: From Static to Intelligent, From Passive to Active</h3>
            <p>The dynamic evolution of knowledge representation not only refers to the dynamic updating and self-correction of knowledge but also emphasizes the deep integration of knowledge representation with the human cognitive process, as well as the dynamic generation, reasoning, and application of knowledge within a cognitive computing framework.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Knowledge Generation:</strong> Utilizing machine learning and natural language processing technologies, automatically extract, generate, and represent knowledge from massive data, achieving dynamic updating and evolution of knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>Context-Aware Knowledge Reasoning:</strong> Combine context information for more precise and flexible knowledge reasoning and decision-making, enhancing the application value of knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>Human-Machine Collaborative Knowledge Construction:</strong> Build more natural and efficient human-machine interaction methods, promoting knowledge sharing and collaborative innovation between human experts and machines.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>III. Multimodal Fusion of Knowledge Representation: From Single to Multiple, From Fragmented to Unified</h3>
            <p>In the digital age, the complexity and diversity of information have reached an unprecedented level, and traditional single-modality knowledge representation methods can no longer meet the growing demand for cross-modality information processing. The presentation of information is no longer limited to text or images but encompasses the fusion of sound, video, haptic feedback, and other modalities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complementary Nature of Modalities:</strong> Different modalities of information may complement each other when expressing the same semantics.</li>
                <li><strong>Synergistic Nature of Modalities:</strong> The synergy of multimodal information can enhance the understanding of complex scenarios.</li>
                <li><strong>Mapping Relationships Between Modalities:</strong> The semantic mapping between different modalities is key to multimodal fusion.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The future of knowledge representation will move towards humanization, dynamic evolution, and multimodal fusion. Humanized knowledge representation emphasizes integrating more humanistic care and emotional factors in the process of knowledge transmission, dynamic evolution emphasizes the deep integration of knowledge representation with the human cognitive process, and multimodal fusion emphasizes the integration of different modalities to build a richer and more precise knowledge representation system.</p>
