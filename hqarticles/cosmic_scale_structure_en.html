            <h2>Shapers of the Cosmos: From Large-Scale Structures to Quantum Fog</h2>
            <p>In the vast expanse of the universe, two enigmatic forces—dark matter and dark energy—act as "invisible hands," profoundly influencing the large-scale structure of the cosmos. Simultaneously, the large-scale structure of the universe serves as a "time capsule," recording every moment from the birth of the universe to the present day. However, as we attempt to delve deeper into the essence of these forces, the intersection of the "cosmological constant" and "quantum gravity" theories brings forth a layer of "quantum fog." This article will explore the shapers of the universe and the profound mysteries behind them from three perspectives: the mysterious roles of dark matter and dark energy, the temporal record of large-scale structures, and the challenges posed by the cosmological constant and quantum gravity.</p>

            <h3>The Mysterious Roles of Dark Matter and Dark Energy</h3>
            <p>Dark matter, a substance that does not participate in electromagnetic interactions and affects the universe's structure solely through gravity, has been widely confirmed through its gravitational effects. It acts as a guide for the formation of cosmic structures, attracting surrounding matter through gravity to form the initial dark matter halos, which gradually evolve into large-scale structures such as galaxy clusters. Without the gravitational influence of dark matter, the formation of galaxies would be significantly slowed, or even unable to form the structures we observe today.</p>
            <p>Dark energy, on the other hand, is a mysterious force driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. Since the end of the 20th century, observations of supernovae have shown that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating, a phenomenon attributed to the presence of dark energy. Dark energy is distributed nearly uniformly throughout the universe in a form that is almost constant, with its density hardly changing over time. This uniformly distributed dark energy drives the accelerated expansion of the universe through a repulsive gravitational effect, causing galaxies to move further apart and the universe's structure to become more uniform.</p>

            <h3>The Wrinkles of the Universe: The Temporal Record of Large-Scale Structures</h3>
            <p>The large-scale structure of the universe, like a "time capsule" of cosmic history, records every moment from the birth of the universe to the present day. 13.8 billion years ago, the universe was born from an infinitely high-temperature, high-density singularity and has been expanding and cooling ever since. To this day, the "residual heat" of the universe—the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB)—is everywhere, like a photograph of the early universe, recording the distribution of matter in the early universe. Through precise measurements of the temperature anisotropies in the CMB, astronomers can depict the distribution characteristics of matter in the early universe. These subtle density fluctuations are the seeds that later evolved into the rich and varied large-scale structures of today.</p>
            <p>Over time, dark matter in the universe gradually gathered, and gravity aggregated the initially uniformly distributed matter into clumps, forming stars, galaxies, galaxy clusters, and eventually superclusters and cosmic walls. Each leap in structure is imprinted with the "fingerprint" of a different historical period of the universe. From the early density fluctuations to the cosmic walls that now span the universe, each leap in structure represents an important turning point in the history of the universe. By comparing the structures of the universe at different time scales, we can more clearly see how the interactions between dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter have shaped the universe we see today.</p>

            <h3>Challenges of the Cosmological Constant and Quantum Gravity</h3>
            <p>In modern cosmology, the cosmological constant and quantum gravity theories pose core challenges to understanding the large-scale structure of the universe. The cosmological constant, a parameter in Einstein's equations of general relativity, describes the density of vacuum energy in the universe. Observational data shows that the cosmological constant is extremely small, almost zero but not exactly zero. This observational value differs greatly from the predicted value in quantum field theory, known as the "cosmological constant problem." Quantum field theory predicts that vacuum energy should be a large positive value, far exceeding the observed value by several orders of magnitude. This discrepancy not only challenges our understanding of the cosmological constant itself but also affects our understanding of the formation of the large-scale structure of the universe.</p>
            <p>Quantum gravity theories, such as string theory and loop quantum gravity, attempt to unify gravity and quantum mechanics at very small scales. These theories provide new perspectives on understanding the origin of the cosmological constant. String theory proposes that the cosmological constant may be determined by the vibrational modes of strings, and the diversity of these modes may result in different values of the cosmological constant in different universes. Loop quantum gravity suggests that the cosmological constant may be determined by quantum fluctuations of spacetime, which manifest as a weak force field on very small scales and affect the overall structure of the universe.</p>
            <p>The multiverse theory and the eternal inflation model provide another explanation for the cosmological constant problem. The multiverse theory posits that our universe is just one of many, each with potentially different physical constants. The eternal inflation model suggests that the universe experienced countless inflation stages, each potentially generating a new universe with different values for the cosmological constant. However, both the multiverse and eternal inflation models face challenges in observational verification. Currently, we cannot directly observe other universes or the details of the inflation stages. Therefore, these models remain largely theoretical speculations and require further observational and experimental validation.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The shapers of the universe—dark matter and dark energy—act as "invisible hands," profoundly influencing the large-scale structure of the cosmos. The large-scale structure of the universe, in turn, serves as a "time capsule," recording every moment from the birth of the universe to the present day. However, as we attempt to delve deeper into the essence of these forces, the intersection of the "cosmological constant" and "quantum gravity" theories brings forth a layer of "quantum fog." In future research, we need to further explore quantum gravity theories and seek new observational and experimental evidence to reveal the deep connections between the cosmological constant and quantum gravity. Only then can we truly understand the deepest structures and evolution of the universe.</p>
