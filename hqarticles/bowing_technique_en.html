            <h2>Bowing Technique in the Digital Age: The Symphony of Tradition and Modernity</h2>
            <p>Music, an art form that transcends time, speaks directly to the heart in its unique language. In string instrument performance, bowing technique is not only a manifestation of skill but also a medium of emotion, giving life to notes and allowing the soul of music to dance. However, with the advent of the digital age, this ancient art is undergoing profound changes, seeking new possibilities in the symphony of tradition and modernity.</p>

            <h3>The Rhythm and Constraints of Traditional Bowing</h3>
            <p>Since ancient times, bowing technique has been the core skill in string instrument performance. It emphasizes the strength, speed, and precision of bowing, allowing performers to express rich emotional colors through various bowing techniques such as legato, staccato, spiccato, and martel√©. For example, the smoothness and continuity of legato are often used to express melancholy or love themes, while the rhythm and breakpoints of staccato are suitable for expressing tension or anger.</p>
            <p>However, traditional bowing instruction and performance formats also limit its expressive diversity to some extent. The apprenticeship method of learning, relying more on imitation and repetition, lacks personalized expression space. Additionally, the concert hall stage and face-to-face interaction limit the interaction between performers and the audience, constraining the expressiveness of bowing to specific spaces and contexts.</p>
