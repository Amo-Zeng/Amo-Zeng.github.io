            <h2>Precision Medicine and Environmental Ethics: Reimagining Future Drug Therapy from Multiple Perspectives</h2>
            <p>In today's rapidly advancing technological landscape, the medical field is undergoing a profound transformation. The rapid development of genomic sequencing, big data analysis, and artificial intelligence has driven the rise of Precision Medicine 2.0, making personalized drug therapy the core trend of future healthcare. However, drug therapy is not merely a product of scientific and technological advancement; its application is intricately intertwined with ethical and environmental factors, forming a complex systems engineering challenge. This article will explore how to reshape the future of drug therapy through a multidimensional perspective, by integrating personalized drug therapy, ethical dilemmas in drug treatment, and the impact of the environment on drug efficacy, with the aim of achieving a more efficient, equitable, and sustainable future in healthcare.</p>

            <h3>Precision Medicine 2.0: The Scientific Foundation of Personalized Drug Therapy</h3>
            <p>The core of Precision Medicine 2.0 lies in using genomic sequencing, biomarker detection, and big data analysis to tailor the most effective treatment plans for individual patients. Breakthroughs in genomic sequencing technology enable doctors to gain a deep understanding of a patient's genetic background and identify gene mutations associated with diseases. For example, EGFR gene mutations in lung cancer patients can guide doctors to choose targeted therapy drugs instead of conventional chemotherapy. This personalized treatment based on genetic information not only enhances treatment efficacy but also significantly reduces unnecessary side effects.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Dilemmas in Drug Therapy: Balancing Commercial Interests and Patient Rights</h3>
            <p>Despite the immense potential of personalized drug therapy, numerous ethical challenges still arise in its practical application. Drug development is a long and costly process, averaging 10-15 years and costing billions of dollars. Pharmaceutical companies invest heavily in research and development, naturally hoping for substantial returns. However, this business logic also raises a series of ethical issues.</p>

            <h3>Environmental Factors in Drug Therapy: The Complex Impact from Pollution to Climate Change</h3>
            <p>The efficacy of drugs is not solely determined by their chemical properties and individual patient differences; environmental factors play a crucial role as well. From climate change to environmental pollution, changes in the external environment can significantly affect drug absorption, metabolism, and ultimate efficacy.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Building a Multidimensional Framework for Drug Therapy</h3>
            <p>The rise of Precision Medicine 2.0, ethical dilemmas in drug therapy, and the impact of the environment on drug efficacy together form the multidimensional challenges of future drug therapy. Personalized drug therapy, through genomic sequencing, big data analysis, and artificial intelligence, provides patients with more accurate and effective treatment plans. However, drug therapy requires not only scientific rigor but also ethical constraints and environmental optimization. Only through the synergy of multiple dimensions can drug therapy truly realize the vision of "curing diseases with precision," benefiting all of humanity.</p>
