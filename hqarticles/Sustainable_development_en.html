            <h3>Application of Digital Twin Technology in Circular Economy</h3>
            <p>Digital twin technology creates data models corresponding to physical entities in virtual space, enabling fine-grained management of the entire product lifecycle. During the product design phase, it helps optimize material selection and structural design to reduce resource consumption. In production, it provides real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance needs, improving efficiency. During the usage phase, it optimizes energy management to reduce waste. In the recycling phase, it guides efficient disassembly and material recycling, reducing environmental pollution. Digital twin technology not only enhances production efficiency but also significantly reduces environmental impact, making it a key technology in promoting circular economy.</p>
