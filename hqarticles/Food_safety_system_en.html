                Artificial intelligence, combined with genetic and dietary behavior data, can build precise dietary risk prediction models, providing tailored dietary recommendations for individuals. For example, personalized recommendation systems can suggest the safest and healthiest dietary plans based on an individual's genotype, physical condition, and eating habits, with real-time updates. This technology not only improves the precision of food safety but also offers new tools for health management.</li>
                <li><strong>2.3 Personalized Food: Reshaping the Future Dietary Landscape</strong><br>
                Personalized food safety transforms traditional "one-size-fits-all" standards into "tailored" precision management, driving food safety from "passive protection" to "active prevention," and from "empiricism" to "precision medicine." In the future, personalized food safety will become an essential part of everyone's health management, leading to a safer, healthier, and more personalized dietary era. This transformation is not just a victory for technology but also a profound reshaping of human health concepts.</li>
