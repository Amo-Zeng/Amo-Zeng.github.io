            <h3>Prospects for Multifunctional Applications</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Smart Buildings and Solar Applications</strong></p>
            <p>The success of perovskite materials in the photovoltaic field makes them an ideal choice for smart building materials. By integrating with other materials, perovskites can be used to manufacture smart glass. This glass not only generates electricity but also helps in energy conservation by adjusting indoor light and temperature. Additionally, its flexibility and high optoelectronic properties make it suitable for flexible electronic devices like wearable photovoltaic components, providing power for smartwatches and health monitoring devices. Perovskites can also be applied to building facades and roofs to further enhance the energy self-sufficiency of buildings.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Energy Supply in Space Exploration</strong></p>
            <p>In the field of space exploration, Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) are considered ideal power sources due to their high efficiency, lightweight, and flexible nature. Their conversion efficiency has approached 25%, capable of functioning effectively in the harsh environments of space. Moreover, perovskite materials can serve as part of space building materials, providing self-powered functionality along with radiation shielding capabilities, reducing reliance on traditional materials.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Environmental Monitoring</strong></p>
            <p>The high sensitivity of perovskites provides broad application prospects in environmental monitoring. By adjusting the ionic composition within the material, highly sensitive photodetectors for specific pollutants can be created. These detectors are not only cost-effective but also capable of real-time monitoring of air quality, water quality, and other environmental parameters, making them suitable for widespread deployment in smart cities. Perovskite detectors can also monitor trace pollutants, providing precise data support.</p>

            <h3>Technological Challenges</h3>
            <p>While the application prospects of perovskite materials are exciting, they face multiple challenges in practical application:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stability Issues:</strong> Whether in the high-humidity environments on Earth or the extreme temperatures and radiation conditions of space, the stability of perovskite materials is a significant challenge. Researchers are enhancing durability through material modification, encapsulation techniques, and the introduction of stabilizers, but continuous optimization is necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Interface Engineering:</strong> When combined with other materials, interface issues in perovskites can affect overall performance. Optimizing interface structures and minimizing interface defects is crucial for enhancing efficiency, requiring precise interface engineering techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Scale Production:</strong> Transitioning from laboratory to large-scale production, the manufacturing process of perovskite materials must overcome challenges like cost control, production efficiency, and product consistency. This involves optimizing processes and improving production equipment.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term Performance:</strong> In space environments, ensuring the long-term stability and performance of perovskite materials without degradation remains a continuous research topic. Material behavior under prolonged exposure to cosmic rays and microgravity conditions needs to be considered.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
            <p>The application of perovskite materials also brings environmental considerations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Burden of Production:</strong> The manufacturing of perovskites might involve toxic substances like lead compounds. Reducing or eliminating the use of these substances in production is key. Additionally, carbon emissions and energy consumption during production are environmental issues to address, pushing the trend towards green manufacturing technologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> How to handle perovskite materials at the end of their lifecycle is a significant issue. Developing biodegradable perovskites or finding alternative materials is a long-term environmental strategy to minimize negative ecological impacts.</li>
                <li><strong>Space Debris Issue:</strong> In space applications, waste management of perovskite materials needs consideration to avoid contributing to space debris. Research into recycling technologies for perovskite materials to reduce space pollution is necessary.</li>
            </ul>
