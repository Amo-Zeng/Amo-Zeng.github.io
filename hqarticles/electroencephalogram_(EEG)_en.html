            <h2>EEG: The Multidimensional Key to Unlocking Human Potential</h2>
            <p>Since its inception in the early 20th century, EEG technology has evolved from its original role as a medical diagnostic tool to become a crucial bridge connecting human thought to the digital world. With its non-invasive, convenient, and high-temporal resolution characteristics, EEG is now a key tool for unlocking human potential and exploring the future of human-computer interaction, with applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), mental health diagnosis, and criminal justice.</p>

            <h3>1. From Science Fiction to Reality: Multidimensional Applications of EEG</h3>
            <h4>1.1 Brain-Computer Interface (BCI): The Future of Human-Computer Interaction</h4>
            <p>BCI, long seen as futuristic technology in science fiction, is now becoming a reality through EEG technology. By capturing and interpreting the electrical signals emitted by the brain, BCI technology enables direct interaction between the human brain and external devices, opening up new avenues for information transmission and control.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Medical Rehabilitation:</strong> EEG-BCI technology offers paralyzed patients the possibility of regaining control over their bodies. By using brain signals to control prosthetics, wheelchairs, and other assistive devices, patients can restore partial mobility and regain hope for their lives.</li>
                <li><strong>Gaming and Entertainment:</strong> EEG-based gaming devices allow players to control game characters with their thoughts, providing an unprecedented immersive experience and injecting new vitality into the gaming industry.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Control:</strong> In the future, EEG-BCI technology could be applied to smart homes, autonomous driving, and other fields, enabling mind control and enhancing efficiency and safety.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.2 Mental Health Diagnosis: Breakthroughs in Objective Biomarkers</h4>
            <p>Mental health issues have become a significant global public health challenge. However, traditional mental health diagnosis relies on subjective clinical interviews and scale assessments, lacking objective biological markers. As a non-invasive, high-temporal resolution neuroimaging technology, EEG has made significant progress in mental health diagnosis.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Depression:</strong> Depressed patients often show abnormal activity in the prefrontal cortex. EEG data can be used to build diagnostic models for depression, with accuracy rates exceeding 80%.</li>
                <li><strong>Anxiety:</strong> Anxiety patients typically exhibit enhanced gamma-band activity. EEG technology combined with virtual reality (VR) environments can monitor patients' brain responses in real-time under simulated stress situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Bipolar Disorder:</strong> Through longitudinal EEG monitoring, changes in brain electrical patterns related to mood swings in bipolar disorder can be captured, enabling early diagnosis.</li>
                <li><strong>Schizophrenia:</strong> EEG can reveal abnormal brain network mechanisms in schizophrenia, providing clues for targeted treatment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.3 Criminal Justice: New Tools for Assessing Mental States and Lie Detection</h4>
            <p>With continuous technological advancements, EEG is gradually demonstrating its potential applications in the criminal justice field.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mental State Assessment:</strong> EEG can analyze brain wave activity to help assess a suspect's mental state, cognitive function, and whether they have psychological disorders.</li>
                <li><strong>Lie Detection:</strong> As a more direct brain function monitoring technology, EEG can analyze brain electrical activity to determine whether an individual is telling the truth.</li>
                <li><strong>Crime Prevention and Rehabilitation:</strong> By monitoring the brain wave activity of potential offenders, high-risk individuals can be identified, allowing for appropriate preventive measures.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Challenges and Prospects: Technical Bottlenecks and Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <h4>2.1 Technical Bottlenecks</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Signal Accuracy and Stability:</strong> Improving the accuracy and stability of EEG signals remains a major technical challenge.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Cost and Operational Threshold:</strong> Lowering device costs and operational thresholds is crucial for broader application in clinical and daily settings.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.2 Ethical and Legal Challenges</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> The privacy protection of EEG data is a pressing issue, ensuring that individuals' brain information is not abused.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy and Reliability:</strong> The accuracy and reliability of EEG technology need further validation to avoid misjudgment and wrongful convictions.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Regulations:</strong> The application of EEG in judicial practices requires corresponding legal regulations to standardize its scope and procedures.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>3. Future Prospects: Multidimensional Integration and Intelligent Development of EEG</h3>
            <p>With the development of artificial intelligence and big data technologies, EEG data analysis will become more intelligent, enabling closed-loop management from diagnosis to treatment. For example, EEG-based neurofeedback training can be used to regulate abnormal brain activity, providing new non-pharmacological treatment options for mental health disorders.</p>
            <p>In the criminal justice field, the application of EEG will become more extensive and in-depth, providing scientific support for judicial decision-making. In the future, with continuous technological advancements and the improvement of ethical and legal frameworks, EEG will play an increasingly important role in mental health and criminal justice.</p>
