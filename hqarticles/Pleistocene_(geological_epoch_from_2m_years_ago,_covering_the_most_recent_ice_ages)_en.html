            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Pleistocene (approximately 2.6 million years ago to 11,700 years ago) was a pivotal period in Earth's history, marked by significant climate fluctuations, the rise and fall of megafauna, and the evolution of humans from Homo erectus to Homo sapiens. This era weaves a complex tapestry of history, where climate changes not only shaped the structure of ecosystems but also profoundly influenced the trajectory of human evolution. Meanwhile, the megafauna of the Pleistocene—such as the mammoth, saber-toothed tiger, and giant ground sloth—played the role of "super species" in the ecosystem, and their disappearance was closely tied to the dual impact of climate change and human activities. This article will explore the "climate code" of the Pleistocene from three perspectives: climate change, human evolution, and megafauna extinction, providing insights into modern climate change and offering new perspectives on the future of humanity and Earth's ecosystems.</p>

            <h3>Part One: Climate Fluctuations and Human Evolution in the Pleistocene</h3>
            <p>A hallmark of the Pleistocene was its frequent climate fluctuations, with global temperatures fluctuating dramatically between glacial and interglacial periods. During glacial periods, temperatures dropped significantly, sea levels fell, and vast amounts of water were stored as glaciers on land. During interglacial periods, temperatures rose, and sea levels also increased. These dramatic climate changes had profound effects on ecosystems, leading to the extinction or migration of many species, while a few adapted and survived.</p>
            <p>For early humans, the climate fluctuations of the Pleistocene were both a challenge and an opportunity. The dramatic changes in climate forced humans to adapt to new ecological environments, driving their evolution. For example, during glacial periods, humans may have faced food shortages and extreme cold, which compelled them to develop more complex social structures and tool-using abilities. During interglacial periods, when the climate was relatively warm and food resources were abundant, this provided conditions for human dispersal and technological innovation.</p>

            <h3>Part Two: The Rise and Fall of Megafauna and Human Activities</h3>
            <p>At the same time, the Pleistocene was also a period of prosperity for megafauna—such as mammoths, saber-toothed tigers, and giant ground sloths. These "super species" played a crucial role in the ecosystem. Mammoths, with their enormous size and range, promoted the spread of vegetation and soil fertility; saber-toothed tigers, as top predators, maintained the balance of the food chain; giant ground sloths, through their unique diet and behavior, influenced the structure of forest ecosystems.</p>
            <p>However, the dual impact of climate change and human activities led to the extinction of these megafauna. Climate change weakened the adaptability of megafauna, while the rise of humans accelerated their extinction. At the end of the Pleistocene, humans rapidly expanded their activities through hunting, technological advancements, and migration, directly competing with megafauna for resources. The "overhunting hypothesis" suggests that human hunting activities were the primary cause of megafauna extinction. These megafauna, with their long reproductive cycles and weak population recovery capabilities, could not recover once subjected to overhunting. Additionally, human migration activities led to the fragmentation of megafauna habitats, further exacerbating their survival pressures.</p>

            <h3>Part Three: The Climate Code and Its Implications for Modern Climate Change</h3>
            <p>The climate code of the Pleistocene not only reveals the complexity of the Earth's climate system but also provides profound insights into modern climate change. The Pleistocene demonstrates the powerful feedback mechanisms of the Earth's climate system. For example, the expansion and melting of ice sheets significantly affect Earth's albedo: an increase in glacier area reflects more solar radiation, further lowering global temperatures; while glacier melting reduces albedo, causing more heat to be absorbed and further exacerbating global warming. This positive feedback mechanism played a key role in both the Pleistocene and modern climate change.</p>
            <p>The climate code of the Pleistocene also reveals the unpredictability and complexity of climate change. Although the Milankovitch cycles provide long-term trends of climate change, the climate fluctuations during the Pleistocene often exhibited unexpected intensity and suddenness. This unpredictability reminds us that today's global warming may trigger a series of unforeseen climate events, such as an increase in extreme weather, ecosystem collapse, and accelerated ocean acidification.</p>

            <h3>Part Four: A Cross-Temporal Climate Dialogue</h3>
            <p>The echoes of the Pleistocene provide us with a cross-temporal climate landscape, revealing the intricate relationship between humans and Earth's ecosystems. The climate fluctuations of the Pleistocene not only shaped the trajectory of human evolution but also profoundly influenced the rise and fall of megafauna. The dual impact of climate change and human activities led to the extinction of megafauna, and this process is still unfolding in the context of modern global warming.</p>
            <p>In modern ecosystems, similar "super species" of the Pleistocene may not reappear, but through scientific and technological efforts, we may provide new hope for the restoration of Earth's ecosystems. For example, genetic engineering and artificial selection are attempting to resurrect some extinct megafauna, such as mammoths. Although these attempts are still in the experimental stage, they offer new perspectives for the future restoration of ecosystems.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The Pleistocene was a period where climate, humanity, and megafauna danced together, and its climate code provides valuable clues for understanding modern climate change. Although the climate changes of the Pleistocene differ fundamentally from modern global warming, the underlying feedback mechanisms and potential threats are surprisingly similar. Facing the challenges of today's global warming, we need deeper understanding and more urgent action to respond to the extreme climate events that may occur. The echoes of the Pleistocene are not only a scientific exploration but also a cross-temporal climate dialogue, reminding us: the future of Earth is in our hands.</p>
