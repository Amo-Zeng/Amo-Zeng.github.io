            <p>Over the past few decades, biosensing technology has evolved from traditional single-point, static, in vitro detection to a new paradigm of intelligent sensing characterized by real-time operation, multimodal capabilities, and adaptive functionality. This paradigm shift not only signifies improved detection accuracy but also heralds systemic transformations in healthcare, neural engineering, and environmental monitoring. This article systematically reviews the current trajectory of technological advancement, analyzes core breakthroughs, and outlines the future pathway toward building a "human-machine metabolic symbiosis ecosystem."</p>

            <h3>1. Paradigm Shift: From Passive Monitoring to Active Regulation</h3>
            <p>Traditional biosensors have largely relied on single biomarkers (e.g., glucose, lactate) detected via in vitro electrochemical methods, suffering from delayed responses, vulnerability to interference, and lack of dynamic feedback. In recent years, the emergence of <strong>closed-loop self-regulation systems</strong> marks a transformation from "monitoring" to "intervention." For example, the "artificial pancreas" system—integrating continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with insulin pumps—has received FDA approval for clinical deployment, reducing average glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in type 1 diabetes patients by 1.2% (n = 1,243, multicenter RCT, 2023). Such systems employ microfluidic chips and adaptive control algorithms to achieve a "sense-decide-act" feedback loop, maintaining error margins within ±10% (Figure 1).</p>

                <p><em>Note: The system comprises a sensing module (e.g., electrochemical electrode), an edge computing unit (with adaptive control algorithms), an actuator (e.g., micro-pump), and a safety feedback mechanism, enabling dynamic glucose regulation.

            <h3>2. Neural Interfaces: Decoding and Writing Bioelectric Signals</h3>
            <p>With the convergence of flexible electronics, micro/nano-fabrication, and artificial intelligence (AI), biosensors are now advancing toward deep integration with <strong>neural interfaces</strong>. Implantable neural sensors can capture real-time electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals or single-neuron spiking activity. When combined with graph neural networks (GNNs) to model neural connectivity maps, signal decoding accuracy is significantly enhanced. In a 2022 Neuralink clinical trial, a paralyzed patient achieved a text output rate of 20 words per minute via a brain-computer interface (BCI), with 92% accuracy. Moreover, integrating optogenetics with electrical stimulation feedback enables sensors not only to "read" neural activity but also to "write" specific stimuli, offering precise intervention pathways for neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy.</p>

            <h3>3. Metabolic Inference: From Individual Molecules to System-Level Modeling</h3>
            <p>Next-generation biosensors are no longer limited to detecting single molecules; instead, they are building <strong>metabolic inference frameworks</strong> that integrate multi-omics data—genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic. For instance, wearable sweat sensors can measure 12 metabolites (e.g., Na⁺, K⁺, lactate, cortisol) and, when combined with AI-driven dynamic Bayesian networks, predict individual states of dehydration, fatigue, and stress (AUC > 0.91). Such systems are advancing the application of "digital twins" in health monitoring—leveraging personalized modeling to enable early warnings of pre-disease states.</p>

            <h3>4. Future Ecosystem: Roadmap for "Human-Machine Metabolic Symbiosis"</h3>
            <p>Over the next decade, biosensors will no longer operate in isolation but will be embedded within a broader "human-machine metabolic symbiosis ecosystem" (Human-Machine Metabolic Symbiosis Ecosystem). Its development can be mapped into a three-phase technological roadmap:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>3 years (2024–2026)</strong>: Achieve multimodal sensor fusion (electrochemical, optical, mechanical) and edge AI deployment; scale up wearable closed-loop systems in chronic disease management; establish standardized data interfaces (e.g., extended IEEE 11073 protocols) to enhance system interoperability.</li>
                <li><strong>5 years (2027–2029)</strong>: Develop implantable neural-metabolic coupled sensors to enable cross-organ metabolic regulation (e.g., brain-gut axis, brain-liver axis); integrate GNNs with federated learning to build decentralized health databases, ensuring privacy and security.</li>
                <li><strong>10 years (2030–2034)</strong>: Construct a "city-scale metabolic network"—leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) to connect individual sensors, hospitals, and environmental monitoring stations, forming a dynamic health early-warning and resource allocation system. For example, predicting epidemic outbreaks based on population-level metabolic trends and enabling intelligent public health resource distribution.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>5. Multidimensional Synergy: Policy, Ethics, and Social Acceptance</h3>
            <p>Technological breakthroughs must be synchronized with institutional innovation. At the policy level, <strong>dynamic regulatory sandboxes</strong> should be established to allow rapid iteration of innovative products in controlled environments; expand medical insurance coverage for closed-loop systems to reduce patient access barriers. Ethically, clear definitions of data ownership, algorithmic transparency, and intervention boundaries are needed to prevent technological determinism from undermining individual autonomy. Regarding social acceptance, a 2023 survey (n = 5,000) found that 68% of chronic disease patients are willing to use closed-loop systems, but only 32% trust AI-based decisions. Therefore, public science education and doctor-patient co-decision mechanisms must be strengthened.</p>
            <p>Moreover, standardized terminology is crucial. This article consistently uses "artificial intelligence" instead of "AI" and provides the full term "graph neural network (GNN)" upon first mention to avoid ambiguity. Other technical terms such as "microfluidics" and "digital twin" adhere to IEEE standard definitions.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The paradigm shift in biosensors is, at its core, a revolutionary transformation from "tool" to "partner." In the future, their value will not only lie in detection accuracy but in building an ecosystem of <strong>sensing-understanding-regulation-collaboration</strong>. Only through the coordinated evolution of technology, policy, ethics, and social acceptance can we achieve the transition from "treating disease" to "preventing disease," and from "individual health" to "collective well-being." This journey is not just a scientific challenge, but an opportunity for civilizational advancement.</p>
