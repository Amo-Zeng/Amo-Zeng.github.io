            <h2>Multiple Functions and Mechanisms of Antioxidants</h2>
            <p>In today's society, antioxidants play a pivotal role not only in environmental protection but also as core elements in health management and technological innovation. They neutralize free radicals, protecting cells and materials from oxidative damage, demonstrating their vast potential across various fields.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Environmental Protection</h3>
            <p>In reducing air pollution, antioxidants are widely used in automotive exhaust treatment and industrial emission control, significantly reducing PM2.5 and harmful gas emissions. In water purification, antioxidants help degrade organic pollutants, protecting aquatic life from oxidative stress.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Health Management</h3>
            <p>The high-stress conditions of modern life often lead to oxidative stress; antioxidants help manage this by promoting cardiovascular health, boosting immune system function, reducing fatigue, and maintaining bodily balance. The development of functional foods and beverages makes antioxidant intake more convenient and effective.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Technological Innovation</h3>
            <p>In electronic products, antioxidants extend the life and performance of devices, such as LED bulbs and PCBs. In the development of new materials like polymers and solar panels, antioxidants protect against environmental aging. The application of nanotechnology has opened new prospects for antioxidants in drug delivery and high-efficacy skincare products.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Application Examples and Future Outlook</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automotive Exhaust Treatment:</strong> By adding specific antioxidants like Vitamin C and E, free radicals in exhaust gases are reduced, lowering pollutant emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Cardiovascular Health:</strong> Foods rich in antioxidants, like red wine and green tea, help improve vascular elasticity, reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Lifespan Extension of Electronic Products:</strong> Using antioxidants in LEDs and PCBs significantly increases their lifespan.</li>
                <li><strong>Nano-Antioxidants:</strong> Nanoscale antioxidant particles show higher efficacy and penetration in skincare products and drug delivery.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, the application of antioxidants also faces challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost vs. Benefit:</strong> The cost of effective antioxidants can be high; finding a balance between economic and environmental benefits is crucial.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Long-term environmental effects of antioxidants need to be assessed to ensure their use does not introduce new environmental issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Innovation:</strong> Continuous development of more environmentally friendly, safe, and efficient antioxidants and their application technologies.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The application of antioxidants extends from environmental protection to health management, and into technological innovation, highlighting their indispensability in modern society. By optimizing the use of antioxidants, we not only improve the environment and enhance quality of life but also drive progress in materials science and technology. In the future, antioxidants will continue to expand their potential in broader fields, helping us tackle the various challenges of modern life and advancing sustainable development.</p>
