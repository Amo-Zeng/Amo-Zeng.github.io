            <h2>Post-Colonial Perspectives on Scientific Ethics: Inequalities in Discourse and Resource Allocation</h2>
            <p>In the context of globalization, the rapid development of science and technology has not only driven economic and social progress but has also brought profound ethical challenges. However, discussions on scientific ethics are often confined within the frameworks of a few developed countries, overlooking the voices and interests of the Global South. Examining scientific ethics through a post-colonial lens reveals that inequalities in discourse and resource allocation are not only historical legacies but also central contradictions in current global technological governance.</p>

            <h3>Tech Giants from Developed Countries: Monopolizers of Discourse</h3>
            <p>Tech giants from developed countries, such as Google and Microsoft in the United States and Siemens in Europe, dominate the global standards for scientific ethics due to their substantial financial, technical, and human resource reserves. These companies not only lead in technological research and development but also wield significant influence in international organizations, academic conferences, and policy-making. For instance, the formulation of ethical standards for artificial intelligence is primarily driven by U.S. and European tech companies and research institutions, while developing countries are often forced to passively accept these standards with little opportunity for participation or modification.</p>
            <p>This monopoly of discourse leads to a "Northern Centrism" in the formulation of ethical standards, where the specific needs and ethical considerations of the Global South are ignored. For example, in issues of data privacy and ethical application of artificial intelligence, standards set by developed countries are often based on their own legal and cultural backgrounds, disregarding the special circumstances of developing countries in terms of data protection capabilities, legal systems, and cultural differences. This unequal distribution of discourse power places technological development in the Global South in a predicament of being "guided" and "regulated."</p>

            <h3>Developing Countries: Marginalized Participants</h3>
            <p>Developing countries face the risk of marginalization when participating in global technological cooperation. Due to shortages in funding, technology, and human resources, these countries often hold weak positions in discussions on scientific ethics. For example, in the ethical debates surrounding cutting-edge fields like gene editing, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence, the voices of developing countries are frequently ignored, even viewed as "backward" or "immature." This marginalization not only restricts the technological development of developing countries but also undermines the inclusiveness and fairness of the global scientific ethics system.</p>
            <p>To avoid marginalization, developing countries need to adopt proactive strategies to protect their own interests. Firstly, they should strengthen the construction of internal scientific ethics systems, cultivate local experts and institutions in the field, and enhance their discourse power in international scientific ethics discussions. Secondly, developing countries should strengthen regional cooperation, form unified positions on scientific ethics, and increase their bargaining power in international negotiations. For example, regional organizations like the African Union and ASEAN are striving to promote coordinated development of scientific ethics within their regions.</p>
