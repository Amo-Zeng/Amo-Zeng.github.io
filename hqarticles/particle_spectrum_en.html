            <h3>I. Expansion of Multi-Dimensional Particle Spectrum Analysis</h3>
            <p>Multi-dimensional particle spectrum analysis not only provides a multi-parameter perspective on particle characteristics but also extends its application domain by combining time evolution and quantum entanglement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Expansion of Parameter Space:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Traditional particle spectrum analysis mainly focuses on quantities like energy and momentum. After introducing the concept of time evolution, decay or flight time of particles becomes a crucial dimension in analysis.</li>
                        <li>Considering quantum entanglement, the spin state of particles and their associations with other particles are also included in the analytical framework.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Increase in Information Density:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Through multi-dimensional analysis, physicists can gain a more comprehensive understanding of particle properties. For example, combining time evolution, the formation and decay processes of particles can be described with greater accuracy.</li>
                        <li>The introduction of quantum entanglement allows us to explore non-local correlations between particles, providing a new way to understand particle behavior.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h3>II. Interaction of Time Evolution with Particle Spectrum</h3>
            <p>Time evolution not only influences the formation of particle spectra but also interacts with them in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Symmetry Breaking and Particle Generation:</strong>
                    <p>After the Big Bang, the universe underwent multiple instances of symmetry breaking, leading to the diversification of particle species. Through multi-dimensional analysis, we can see more clearly how these processes evolved over time.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Particle Freezing and Annihilation:</strong>
                    <p>As the universe expanded and cooled, particles might enter a frozen state or reduce through annihilation. Multi-dimensional analysis helps us understand the dynamics and statistical characteristics of these processes.</p>
