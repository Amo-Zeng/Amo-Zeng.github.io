            <h2>Digital Capitalism, Ecological Crisis, and Global Inequality: Contemporary Dialogue and Innovation of Marxist Theory</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of globalization and information technology, the mode of capitalist production is undergoing profound changes. The rise of digital capitalism, the intensification of ecological crises, and the deepening of global inequality have breathed new life into Marx’s theories, making them highly relevant and instructive in the contemporary context. This article integrates Marx’s theoretical framework to explore the commodification of data and labor alienation in digital capitalism, the relationship between ecological crises and capitalist production methods, and the inequality faced by the Global South under the conditions of colonialism and post-colonialism. Through a systematic analysis of these issues, this article not only reconsiders the contemporary significance of Marxist theory but also provides new pathways for building a more just and sustainable socio-economic model.</p>

            <h3>I. Digital Capitalism: The New Form of Data Commodities and Labor Alienation</h3>
            <p>In the era of digital capitalism, data has become a new type of commodity and the core resource for capital accumulation. Marx’s commodity theory has found a new reflection in contemporary times, revealing the intangible nature of data and its unique characteristics of use value and exchange value. Data serves as the foundation for market analysis and user profiling, and it drives economic growth through algorithm-driven AI systems. However, the production process of data is essentially a form of labor. Users generate data while using internet services, which is then appropriated by platforms without compensation, aligning closely with Marx’s critique of capitalist exploitation mechanisms.</p>
            <p>At the same time, labor alienation in the platform economy has become increasingly evident. Social media and algorithm-driven recommendation systems control not only users’ access to information and behavior patterns but also gradually strip content creators of their freedom of expression. Workers in the gig economy, such as food delivery riders and ride-sharing drivers, appear to enjoy the status of "freelancers," yet their labor time and income are strictly controlled by platform algorithms, with their labor成果 being appropriated by the platform without compensation. This new form of alienation indicates that while digital capitalism has transformed the form of labor, it has not eliminated the exploitation and alienation of workers. Workers in the platform economy remain subject to the logic of capital, and their autonomy and creativity are further eroded in the digital age.</p>

            <h3>II. Ecological Crisis and the Conflict with Capitalist Production Methods</h3>
            <p>The contemporary ecological crisis is a concentrated manifestation of the imbalance in the relationship between humans and nature on a global scale, closely linked to capitalist production methods. Marx’s theory of "metabolic rift" provides profound insights into understanding this crisis. Under the capitalist system, the process of material and energy exchange between human society and the natural world is disrupted, leading to unsustainable environmental consequences. The excessive use of fertilizers, pesticides, and industrial waste emissions in modern agriculture and industry damage natural cycles of soil, water, and air, exacerbating the collapse of ecosystems.</p>
            <p>The growth logic of capitalism conflicts sharply with the goals of sustainable development. The process of capital accumulation relies on the limitless exploitation of natural resources, leading to global resource depletion and environmental pollution. The culture of consumerism fuels overconsumption and waste, further accelerating ecological degradation. Addressing the ecological crisis requires a fundamental transformation of capitalist production methods, shifting towards models that prioritize environmental sustainability and social equity.</p>

            <h3>III. Global Inequality in the Context of Colonialism and Post-Colonialism</h3>
            <p>The Global South continues to face profound inequalities under the legacies of colonialism and post-colonialism. Historically, colonial exploitation extracted resources and labor from colonized regions, establishing an enduring framework of global inequality. In the contemporary era, this inequality is perpetuated through economic structures that favor the extraction of resources and cheap labor from the Global South while maintaining unequal trade relationships.</p>
            <p>The exploitation of natural resources in the Global South under capitalist production methods has resulted in environmental degradation and social disintegration. Indigenous communities are particularly vulnerable, as their ecosystems and ways of life are disrupted by the extraction processes. Digital capitalism further deepens these inequalities, as technological advancements often benefit the Global North while leaving the Global South in a position of technological dependency and economic subservience.</p>
            <p>Addressing global inequality requires challenging the historical and contemporary structures of power that perpetuate exploitation and marginalization. A just and sustainable global order must prioritize equitable access to resources, technology, and opportunities, while respecting the rights and autonomy of communities in the Global South.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The complexities of digital capitalism, ecological crisis, and global inequality demand a reexamination of Marxist theory and its potential for innovation. By exploring the commodification of data, the alienation of labor, the conflict between capitalist production and environmental sustainability, and the structural inequalities faced by the Global South, this article has highlighted the continued relevance and transformative power of Marxist analysis. As we navigate the challenges of the 21st century, addressing these issues calls for the development of alternative socioeconomic models that prioritize justice, sustainability, and the equitable distribution of resources and opportunities. Through such efforts, we can strive towards a more humane and ecologically balanced world.</p>
