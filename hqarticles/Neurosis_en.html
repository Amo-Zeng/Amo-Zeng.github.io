  <h3>Privacy Challenges of Biometrics and Real-Time Monitoring</h3>
  <p>Currently, the widespread use of facial recognition systems in urban surveillance and personal devices has raised concerns about privacy erosion. For example, there have been documented cases in certain countries where public surveillance systems have been misused, enabling real-time tracking of individuals' movements.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Real-time biometric recognition eliminates the possibility of remaining anonymous</li>
    <li>Risk of commercial abuse of medical and genetic data</li>
    <li>IoT devices continuously collect user behavior data</li>
  </ul>

### 3. **Case Study Module**
```html
<section>
  <h3>Analysis of Major Global Data Breach Incidents</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2021: A social media platform leaked data of 235 million users sold on the dark web</li>
    <li>2015: A healthcare company exposed 115 million medical records</li>
    <li>Vulnerabilities in IoT devices led to smart TVs monitoring user behavior</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These cases reveal that unclear data ownership and the lack of corporate security standards are root causes of breaches.</p>
