        <section>
            <h3>I. Human-Machine Symbiosis: Reconstructing the Role Relationship in Welding</h3>
            <p>Traditional automatic welding methods were based on "human-machine collaboration," where machines performed repetitive and high-intensity welding tasks, while humans were responsible for programming and quality inspection. In the "human-machine symbiosis" model, humans and machines are more deeply integrated and complementary, with enhanced machine learning capabilities and more user-friendly human-machine interaction, leading to more flexible collaborative working models.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AI Enabling:</strong> Machines can autonomously learn and optimize welding parameters.</li>
                <li><strong>Human-Machine Interaction Revolution:</strong> The application of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies reduces the operating threshold.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborative Working Model:</strong> Machines handle high-precision tasks, while humans manage complex welding of special-shaped parts.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>II. Multifunctional Integration: Revolutionizing Welding Technology Applications</h3>
