### 📘 Introduction to Mathematics A (Advanced Math, based on the Taiwanese entrance exam system):

In the university entrance system of Taiwan, especially in the "Subject-based Assessment Exam (指考)", mathematics is divided into two categories:

- **Mathematics A (Math A)**
  - **Target Students**: Mainly for students in the **science stream**.
  - **Coverage**: Includes content from **Volume 1 to Volume 4** of high school mathematics.
  - **Key Topics**:
    - Numbers and expressions, polynomials
    - Exponents and logarithms
    - Trigonometric functions, plane and spatial vectors
    - Linear algebra (e.g., matrices, determinants)
    - Probability and statistics (basic level)
    - Limits, functions, and derivatives
    - Sequences and series

- **Mathematics B (Math B)**
  - **Target Students**: Mainly for students in the **arts/social science stream**.
  - Content is relatively simpler, more application-focused, and usually less difficult than Math A.

### 📌 Differences Between Mathematics A and Mathematics B:

| Category        | Mathematics A (Science Stream) | Mathematics B (Arts/Social Science Stream) |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Difficulty**   | Higher                         | Relatively lower                             |
| **Content**      | Includes calculus, vectors, matrices, etc. | Simplified content with more real-life applications |
| **Exam Time**    | 80 minutes                     | 80 minutes                                   |
| **Relevant Majors** | Science, engineering, medicine, tech | Social sciences, business, education         |

### ✅ If you're preparing for the Mathematics A exam, here are some suggestions:

1. **Review textbook content thoroughly**, especially math problems and formulas from grades 10 to 12.
2. **Focus on conceptual understanding and derivation**, as Math A emphasizes logical reasoning and problem variation.
3. **Practice with past exam papers** to get a sense of the question types and trends.
4. **Strengthen key topics**: such as calculus, vectors, complex numbers, polar coordinates, and linear algebra.
