            <p>In the grand symphony of human civilization, the main melody is always highlighted in golden splendor—the history of victors, the narratives of dominant groups, and the voices that meet expectations. However, when we adjust the focus of our hearing, we discover a more complex acoustic landscape within this grand symphony: the second theme deliberately downplayed by the composer, the improvisational embellishments of the musicians, and even the unexpected sounds from outside the orchestra pit. These systematically backgrounded sounds constitute the core field of what French thinker Foucault called the "politics of audibility"—where not only is it decided who has the right to speak, but the auditory habits of the entire society are subtly disciplined.</p>

            <h3>I. The Silencing in Historiography</h3>
            <p>The compilation of orthodox historical texts is essentially a precise silencing project. Sima Qian pioneered the biographical style in "Records of the Grand Historian," but inadvertently established a three-tiered volume control system: "emperors-generals-extraordinary individuals." In "History of the Peloponnesian War," Thucydides deliberately removed poetic elements, constructing history as a purely political and military narrative. This acoustic apparatus of knowledge power is so effective that we almost forget: every stone of the Acropolis is soaked with the sweat of slaves, and every inch of the Great Wall's rammed earth is condensed with the homesickness of conscripted laborers.</p>
            <p>The silenced historical voices often lurk in the form of cultural "codes." The migration narratives in Miao ancient songs, the oral memories of persecution among the Roma, and the secret ritual chants of Japan's Burakumin—these sounds judged as "noise" by orthodox history books are actually the keys to deconstructing singular historical narratives. Russian thinker Bakhtin, in his study of Rabelais, found that official culture always gives rise to its shadow-like "folk humorous culture"—the former is a solemn monologue, while the latter is a polyphony filled with hisses, laughter, and bodily noises. When we discover transformation texts in the Dunhuang manuscripts or decipher workers' songs on Egyptian papyrus, we are hearing the soundtracks that were never developed in the darkroom of history.</p>

            <h3>II. The Alienation of Hearing in Contemporary Society</h3>
            <p>The modernity promise of "everyone can speak" is evolving into a new auditory utopia. The "echo chamber effect" created by algorithmic platforms causes different voices to automatically cluster, forming what French sociologist Bourdieu called "segmented auditory fields." At the demolition site of Beijing's hutongs, the roar of bulldozers intelligently drowns out the protests of residents; at Silicon Valley tech conferences, the accents of Indian engineers are automatically corrected to standard American pronunciation. The "auditory domestication" predicted by German critical theorist Adorno has become a reality—we walk through the world wearing noise-canceling headphones, unaware that we might be filtering out the most important frequencies of civilization.</p>
            <p>This auditory politics creates a bizarre paradox in identity recognition. As revealed in the third article, when a Black woman enters a Wall Street conference room, her professional insights are first classified by the auditory system under the background label of "Black female voice." Japanese writer Yū Miri describes the "invisible person" phenomenon in "Girlfriends": on the streets of Tokyo, the presence of Southeast Asian migrant workers is like a blind spot in vision, a mute button in hearing. This backgrounding is not physical silencing but cognitive frequency blocking—just as ultrasound exists for certain creatures but can never be received by their senses.</p>

            <h3>III. The Acoustic Politics of Silence</h3>
            <p>The subversiveness of John Cage's "4'33"" lies in its revelation that absolute silence does not exist; so-called "silence" is merely a reallocation of auditory attention. In Chinese landscape paintings, viewers can "hear" the sounds of springs and birds in the blank spaces; in Cormac McCarthy's novels, the pauses between lines are more deafening than the dialogue. These artistic practices suggest that backgrounded sounds often announce their presence through "negative space," much like dark matter in the universe proves its existence through gravitational effects.</p>
            <p>This acoustic politics is particularly evident in colonial contexts. The protest poetry of Jamaican poet Marcus Garvey was dismissed by the British colonial government as "meaningless dialect noise," yet half a century later, it became the inspiration for reggae music. Similarly, the Dong ethnic group's grand songs were judged as "primitive harmony" by musicologists in the 1950s, only to be recognized as "living fossils of polyphonic music" during a performance in Paris in 1986. These cases prove that the backgrounding of sound is never a technical issue but a monopoly of auditory standards by power.</p>

            <h3>IV. The Possibility of Reconstructing Auditory Ethics</h3>
            <p>Anthropologist Steven Feld's "acoustic ecology" offers us a new path. In the Hani rice terraces of Yunnan, researchers found that the locals' auditory map includes precise classifications of 37 types of water sounds—this "deep listening" ability allows them to maintain a dialogue with the environment even in the process of modernization. Similarly, Brazilian indigenous people maintain their territory by imitating the low-frequency roars of jaguars, a soundwave communication system that was only "scientifically" rediscovered with the advent of bioacoustics.</p>
            <p>Reconstructing auditory ethics requires what Foucault called "heterotopias"—special spaces that temporarily suspend the mainstream auditory order. The "Poetry on the Underground" in London allows commuters to suddenly "hear" poetry; Taipei's "Sound Museum" collects the soon-to-disappear street vendor calls; Iceland's "silent disco" lets dancers create their own rhythms through headphones. These practices challenge a deeply ingrained belief: that certain sounds are inherently meant to be background.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The true maturity of civilization may begin when we can hear the sounds we have backgrounded ourselves. When white listeners finally understand the Black suffering in the blues, when urbanites begin to decipher the phenological codes in the 24 solar terms, when male readers truly hear the suffocation in "The First Love of Fang Siqi"—this auditory revolution is no less than a Copernican cognitive shift. Those long-regarded background noises: the chatter of housewives, the sighs of migrant workers, the silence of depression patients... they may be the most urgently needed main melodies of our time.</p>
            <p>In the present, where climate crisis and AI singularity coexist, humanity needs a complete auditory spectrum more than ever. The canopy communities of the Amazon rainforest transmit warnings through infrasound, the seismic belts of the Pacific Ocean release the low hum of tectonic movements—these sounds we once classified as "natural background noise" are actually vital information for survival. Similarly, the voices of groups marginalized in the social soundscape may contain the key codes for civilizational transformation. After all, when all "background sounds" suddenly fall silent, people will realize: the so-called main melody has always been just a temporarily prominent voice in the polyphony.</p>
            <p>In an era filled with various sounds, true silence is not the absence of sound but the systematic suppression and neglect of certain sounds. Rediscovering these silent melodies is not only a pursuit of historical justice but also an exploration of humanity's future possibilities. When our ears learn to listen to these background sounds, we may discover that the silent melodies we long regarded as noise are precisely the most moving movements in the symphony of civilization. Let us all become the light in the background—not a subdued existence, but a visible, audible, and re-cognizable diversity of colors. Because in this world, no one is merely someone else's backdrop—we are all the protagonists of our own stories.</p>
