            <h2>I. Applications of Transformer in Natural Language Processing</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Text Generation and Translation</h3>
            <p>Transformer models, especially their variants like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), have demonstrated significant advantages in text generation and machine translation. GPT series models, through large-scale pre-training, can generate coherent and contextually relevant text, widely applied in dialogue systems, content creation, and other scenarios. BERT and its variants have excelled in machine translation tasks, capturing context information through bidirectional encoding, significantly enhancing translation accuracy and fluency.</p>

            <h3>1.2 Sentiment Analysis and Semantic Understanding</h3>
            <p>In sentiment analysis and semantic understanding, Transformer models can deeply mine the emotional tendencies and semantic relationships within text. Through the self-attention mechanism, the model can focus on key parts of the text, accurately identifying emotional polarity. Additionally, BERT models, through bidirectional pre-training, can better understand sentence-level semantics, providing strong support for applications such as question answering systems and sentiment classification.</p>

            <h3>1.3 Information Extraction and Knowledge Graphs</h3>
            <p>Transformer models have also played an important role in information extraction and knowledge graph construction. Through pre-training and fine-tuning, the model can extract entities, relationships, and events from large-scale text, providing technical support for the automatic construction of knowledge graphs. For example, the ERNIE (Enhanced Representation through kNowledge Integration) model, by integrating knowledge graph information, further enhances the accuracy and comprehensiveness of information extraction.</p>

            <h2>II. Structure and Working Principles of Transformer</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Self-Attention Mechanism</h3>
            <p>The core of Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to consider the influence of all words in a sentence when processing each word, thereby capturing long-range dependencies. The self-attention mechanism calculates the similarity between queries, keys, and values, assigning a weight distribution to each word, and then obtaining the final representation through weighted summation. This mechanism's advantage lies in its ability to dynamically adjust each word's representation, reflecting its importance within the context.</p>
            <p>The core formula of the self-attention mechanism is as follows:</p>
            <pre><code>\[ \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V \]</code></pre>
            <p>Where \(Q\), \(K\), and \(V\) represent the query, key, and value matrices, respectively, and \(d_k\) is the dimension of the key. Through this formula, the model can generate a context-aware representation for each word, better capturing the semantic structure of the sentence.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Encoder-Decoder Structure</h3>
            <p>Transformer adopts an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder transforms the input sequence into a series of context representations, and the decoder generates the output sequence based on these representations. The encoder consists of multiple identical layers, each containing a self-attention sub-layer and a feed-forward neural network sub-layer, ensuring effective information transfer through residual connections and layer normalization. The decoder adds a masked self-attention mechanism on top of the encoder to prevent information leakage from future positions.</p>
            <p>The structure of the encoder and decoder is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encoder Layer</strong>: Each layer contains two sub-layers:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Self-attention sub-layer: Processes the input sequence, generating context-aware representations.</li>
                        <li>Feed-forward neural network sub-layer: Performs non-linear transformations on each position's representation.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Decoder Layer</strong>: Each layer contains three sub-layers:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Masked self-attention sub-layer: Prevents future information leakage.</li>
                        <li>Encoder-decoder attention sub-layer: Interacts the encoder's output with the decoder's input.</li>
                        <li>Feed-forward neural network sub-layer: Same as the encoder.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through this structure, Transformer can consider both global and local information when processing sequence data, excelling in various tasks.</p>

            <h3>2.3 Positional Encoding</h3>
            <p>Since Transformer does not rely on sequence order, positional encoding (Positional Encoding) is introduced to capture sequence position information. Positional encoding typically uses sine and cosine functions to generate a unique encoding for each position, which is added to the word embedding before being input into the model, allowing the model to perceive sequence order.</p>
            <p>The formula for positional encoding is as follows:</p>
            <pre><code>\[ PE_{(pos, 2i)} = \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{\frac{2i}{d_{\text{model}}}}}\right) \]
\[ PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{\frac{2i}{d_{\text{model}}}}}\right) \]</code></pre>
            <p>Where \(pos\) is the position, \(i\) is the dimension index, and \(d_{\text{model}}\) is the model's dimension. In this way, the model can integrate position information into word embeddings, maintaining sensitivity to sequence order when processing sequence data.</p>

            <h3>2.4 Multi-Head Attention Mechanism</h3>
            <p>To further enhance the model's expressive power, Transformer introduces the multi-head attention mechanism (Multi-Head Attention). This mechanism allows the model to compute attention in parallel across different subspaces, capturing richer semantic information. Each attention head independently calculates self-attention, and the outputs of all heads are concatenated and linearly transformed to obtain the final representation.</p>
            <p>The formula for the multi-head attention mechanism is as follows:</p>
            <pre><code>\[ \text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \text{head}_2, \dots, \text{head}_h)W^O \]
\[ \text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V) \]</code></pre>
            <p>Where \(h\) is the number of attention heads, \(W_i^Q\), \(W_i^K\), and \(W_i^V\) are projection matrices for each head, and \(W^O\) is the linear transformation matrix after concatenating the multi-head outputs. Through the multi-head attention mechanism, the model can capture different semantic features in different subspaces, thereby improving overall model performance.</p>
