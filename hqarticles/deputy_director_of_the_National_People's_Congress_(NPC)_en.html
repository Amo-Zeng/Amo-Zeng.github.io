            <p>The widespread adoption of digital technology has made interactions between delegates and their constituents more frequent, direct, and diverse:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Live Streaming on Social Media</strong>: Delegates use live streaming platforms to explain policies in detail, introduce legislative processes, and respond to voter inquiries in real-time, significantly enhancing policy transparency and public engagement.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive Q&A and Feedback Mechanisms</strong>: Using platforms like Weibo and WeChat, delegates can collect voter opinions in real-time, ensuring that policy-making reflects public opinion, enhancing the legitimacy and public support for policies.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Participation Platforms</strong>: Local governments and legislative meetings develop platforms that allow voters not only to submit suggestions but also to participate in discussions and even influence policy-making through voting, thereby increasing democratic participation.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Data-Driven Decision Making</h4>

                <li><strong>Predictive Analytics</strong>: Based on historical and current data, predict the future impacts of policies, preempt risks, and optimize benefits.</li>
                <li><strong>Increasing Transparency</strong>: Through the documentation and sharing of data-driven decision-making processes, enhancing the transparency of the legislative process, and increasing public trust in legislation.</li>

                <li><strong>Support for Social Enterprises and Innovative Public Projects</strong>: Creating a favorable environment through legislation to encourage the development of social enterprises and foster innovation in public welfare.</li>
