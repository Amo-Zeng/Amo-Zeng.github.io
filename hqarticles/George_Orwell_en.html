            <h2>Technological Surveillance and the Erosion of Privacy Rights</h2>
            <p>In "1984," Orwell depicted a world ruled by the omnipresent surveillance of "Big Brother." This concept finds its real-life counterpart in today's digital era. In modern society, personal privacy is being eroded by digital surveillance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Personal information that users voluntarily share is not only used for commercial purposes but can also be utilized by governments for national security surveillance, achieving a sort of "omnipresent surveillance."</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Devices:</strong> From smartphones to smart home systems, these devices collect more and more personal data. While providing convenience, users implicitly accept being monitored.</li>
                <li><strong>Government Surveillance Systems:</strong> Such as China's "Skynet" project and the U.S. PRISM program, these systems, under the guise of national security, infringe on personal privacy, sparking widespread discussion about the balance between individual freedom and national security.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Such surveillance not only impacts individual freedom but can also lead to social stratification and inequality. Institutions and governments that control data can understand individuals better than they understand themselves, thus gaining an advantage in information warfare, further exacerbating power imbalances.</p>

            <h2>Shaping Thoughts through Language and Control</h2>
            <p>The "Newspeak" in "1984" aimed to control thought by limiting language, a phenomenon also reflected in modern society:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Political Correctness:</strong> While its intent is to avoid language discrimination, it can also lead to restrictions on freedom of speech and self-censorship.</li>
                <li><strong>Media Manipulation:</strong> Through selective reporting and framing of news, the media can shape public perception of events and groups, influencing public opinion.</li>
                <li><strong>Education and Language Policy:</strong> These tools can be used to promote the official language, suppress minority languages, thereby limiting cultural and intellectual diversity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Language is not just a tool for communication but also a carrier of thought. Protecting linguistic diversity and freedom of expression is a crucial step in defending the freedom of human thought.</p>

            <h2>The Irony of Social Justice and Equality</h2>
            <p>"Animal Farm" uses the animal revolution to satirize the power structure and social inequality post-revolution, revealing the gap between ideals and reality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Distortion of Revolution:</strong> Power concentrates in the hands of a few elites post-revolution, leading to new inequalities, similar to economic and social inequalities faced by many countries today.</li>
                <li><strong>Contemporary Multifaceted Inequality:</strong> Including economic, racial, and gender inequality, these issues persist in modern society, further complicated by technological surveillance and language control.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflection and Reform:</strong> There is a need for institutional transparency, education, innovative policies, and social movements to push for genuine social justice and equality.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>From Orwell's novels to today's reality, issues of technological surveillance, language control, and social justice are closely intertwined. Technology brings convenience but challenges privacy rights; language, as a vessel for thought, is manipulated by power structures; and the ideal of social justice faces numerous distortions in reality. To tackle these challenges, we need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Laws and Policies:</strong> Implement and enforce laws that protect personal privacy and freedom of speech, like the EU's GDPR.</li>
                <li><strong>Tech Ethics:</strong> Ensure technology development promotes societal equity and individual freedom rather than becoming a new tool for control.</li>
                <li><strong>Education and Awareness:</strong> Increase public awareness of these issues through education, fostering critical thinking.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Only through these means can we ensure personal freedom and privacy are safeguarded in the era of technological advancement, achieving true social justice and equality, and avoiding becoming the new face of "Big Brother."</p>
