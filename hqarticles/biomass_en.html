            <h2>From Waste to "Liquid Gold": Biorefinery Leading the Future Green Revolution</h2>
            <p>Throughout human history, alchemists dreamed of transforming common metals into gold, laying the foundation for modern chemistry despite their unfulfilled dream. Today, under the dual pressures of resource depletion and environmental pollution, a new form of "alchemy" is quietly emerging. Rather than focusing on metal transformation, it turns its attention to the broader field of biomass, striving to convert various wastes into high-value "liquid gold" â€“ this is biorefinery. Biorefinery is not just a technology but also a philosophy, reminding us that every part of nature has value. With innovative perspective and scientific methods, we can transform waste into treasure, creating a better future for both humanity and the planet.</p>

            <h3>Biorefinery: From Lab to Industrialization</h3>
            <p>The potential of biorefinery extends far beyond this. With the development of synthetic biology and systems biology, scientists can design microorganisms like programming computer systems, enabling them to produce a wider range of high-value chemicals. From pharmaceutical precursors to flavorings, from biofuels to functional materials, the application prospects of biorefinery are incredibly vast. However, converting these laboratory miracles into industrial production requires overcoming challenges such as cost, scalability, and commercialization.</p>

            <h3>Bio-intelligent Cities: Biomass Driving Revolutionary Changes in Future Urban Energy Systems</h3>
            <p>Against the backdrop of global climate change and energy crises, building a sustainable urban energy system has become an urgent issue. Bio-intelligent cities, as an innovative concept integrating biotechnology and smart technology, are leading revolutionary changes in future urban energy systems with their unique biomass energy utilization.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Circular Regeneration:</strong> Mimicking the cycling mechanisms of natural ecosystems to achieve efficient resource utilization and waste regeneration.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Coordination:</strong> Utilizing biological sensors, artificial intelligence, and other technologies to enable intelligent sensing, analysis, and regulation of urban system elements, achieving optimal resource allocation and ecological balance.</li>
                <li><strong>Human-Nature Symbiosis:</strong> Emphasizing harmony between humans and nature, creating a healthy and comfortable urban living environment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In bio-intelligent cities, biomass will become the core fuel driving urban energy systems, with the following advantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Highly Renewable:</strong> Plants store solar energy as chemical energy in biomass through photosynthesis, continuously supplying energy to the city.</li>
                <li><strong>Low-Carbon and Environmentally Friendly:</strong> Compared to fossil fuels, biomass combustion emits less carbon dioxide that can be reabsorbed by plants, achieving carbon neutral cycles.</li>
                <li><strong>Diverse Resources:</strong> Biomass sources are extensive, including agricultural waste, forestry residues, urban organic waste, etc., providing a diversified raw material base for urban energy systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Bio-intelligent cities leverage various technical pathways for biomass energy utilization, covering power generation, heating, hydrogen production, and biofuels, providing comprehensive support for urban energy systems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biomass Power Generation:</strong> Converting biomass materials like crop residues and wood waste into electricity for clean urban power supply.</li>
                <li><strong>Biomass Heating:</strong> Using biomass boilers or co-generation technologies to provide clean heat for residential areas and industrial parks.</li>
                <li><strong>Biomass Hydrogen Production:</strong> Converting biomass into hydrogen via biological fermentation or pyrolysis for fuel cell vehicle power.</li>
                <li><strong>Biofuels:</strong> Producing biodiesel and bioethanol from biomass sources like algae and crop residues to replace fossil fuels.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Art of Microorganisms: Gene Editing Creating New Biomass Materials</h3>
            <p>Microorganisms, these tiny invisible lives, are quietly becoming a transformative force in human society. Driven by gene editing technology, they are breaking traditional material science boundaries, creating unprecedented new biomass materials, offering limitless possibilities for human society.</p>
            <p>The advent of gene editing technology has brought revolutionary changes to microbial material production. With tools like CRISPR-Cas9, scientists can precisely modify microbial genomes, enhancing their ability to synthesize specific materials, optimizing material performance, or even creating entirely new materials.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High-Performance Bioplastics:</strong> By gene editing, scientists can design microorganisms capable of efficiently synthesizing high-performance bioplastics. For example, introducing plant-derived dihydroxyacetone kinase genes into E. coli significantly improves PHA synthesis efficiency and imparts better thermal stability and mechanical properties.</li>
                <li><strong>Green Energy Materials:</strong> Gene editing can also develop new biofuels and chemicals. For instance, modifying yeast genomes for efficient renewable resource-based ethanol or butanol production offers new solutions to the energy crisis.</li>
                <li><strong>Intelligent Responsive Materials:</strong> Gene editing can even endow microbial materials with intelligent responsive properties. For example, designing materials that sense environmental changes (e.g., temperature, pH) and respond accordingly, useful in drug delivery, environmental monitoring, etc.</li>
            </ul>
