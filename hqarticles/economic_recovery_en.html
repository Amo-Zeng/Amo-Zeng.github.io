            <h2>Multiple Challenges in the Global Economy and Three Key Pathways</h2>
            <p>In the context of multiple challenges facing the global economy, the green economy, digital technology, and social inclusion have become three key pathways to drive economic recovery and sustainable development. This article will explore how comprehensive measures can be taken in these three areas to achieve a harmonious coexistence of the economy, society, and the environment, laying a solid foundation for the future development of the economy.</p>

            <h3>1. Green Economy: Achieving a Win-Win for the Economy and the Environment</h3>
            <p>Globally, climate change and environmental degradation have become challenges that cannot be ignored. The green economy not only focuses on economic growth but also emphasizes reducing the negative impact on the environment during the development process, aiming to achieve a harmonious coexistence of the economy, society, and the environment. By developing green energy, promoting a circular economy, and improving resource utilization efficiency, the green economy provides new pathways for economic recovery.</p>
            <section>
                <h4>1.1 Developing Green Energy to Promote Energy Transition</h4>
                <p>Energy is the cornerstone of economic development, and the extensive use of traditional fossil fuels is one of the main reasons for climate change. Therefore, developing green energy, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, is key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving an energy transition. Governments can support companies in investing in clean energy projects through policies like green loans and tax incentives. For example, the German government's "Energy Transition" plan has significantly promoted the development of solar and wind energy through fiscal subsidies and tax benefits, not only reducing dependence on fossil fuels but also creating numerous job opportunities and promoting sustainable economic growth.</p>

                <h4>1.2 Promoting a Circular Economy to Achieve Efficient Resource Utilization</h4>
                <p>A circular economy is a development model that focuses on efficient and circular resource utilization, aiming to reduce resource consumption and waste generation, and improve resource utilization efficiency. By promoting a circular economy, the dependence on natural resources can be effectively reduced, and environmental pollution can be minimized. For instance, the European Union's "Circular Economy Action Plan" encourages companies to adopt a circular economy model by designing recyclable and reusable products, reducing resource waste. In China, some cities have begun implementing waste sorting and resource recycling policies, not only increasing the recycling rate of resources but also promoting the development of related industries.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>1.3 Improving Resource Utilization Efficiency to Promote Green Production</h4>
                <p>Improving resource utilization efficiency is one of the important ways to achieve a green economy. Through technological innovation and management optimization, companies can reduce resource consumption and waste emissions in the production process, achieving a win-win in economic and environmental benefits. For example, by adopting advanced energy-saving technologies and equipment, companies can significantly reduce energy consumption; by implementing green supply chain management, the environmental impact of the entire supply chain can be reduced. Additionally, governments can guide companies to improve resource utilization efficiency and promote green production by setting strict environmental standards and providing technical guidance.</p>

            <h3>2. Digital Technology: A New Driving Force for Economic Recovery</h3>
            <p>In the 21st century, the development of digital technology has become a significant force driving the global economic transformation. From big data and artificial intelligence to cloud computing, these advanced technologies have not only brought unprecedented changes to traditional industries but also provided vast opportunities for the rise of emerging industries. Digital technology not only improves the operational efficiency of enterprises but also promotes innovation in consumption models, injecting new vitality into economic growth.</p>
            <section>
                <h4>2.1 Digital Transformation of Traditional Industries</h4>
                <p>The application of digital technology is driving the digital transformation of traditional industries, improving production efficiency and service quality.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intelligent Supply Chain Management:</strong> By establishing an intelligent supply chain management system, companies can use big data and artificial intelligence technologies to more accurately predict market demand, optimize inventory management, reduce inventory costs, and improve response speed. For example, Amazon has achieved full automation from order to delivery through its advanced supply chain management system, significantly improving logistics efficiency.</li>
