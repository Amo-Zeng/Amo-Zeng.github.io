            <h2>Future Collaboration in the Medical Field with Mixed Reality</h2>
            <p>The application of mixed reality technology in the medical field extends beyond being a mere auxiliary tool for individual doctors, and can serve as a platform for multidisciplinary team collaboration. MR systems can integrate image data from different medical devices in real-time, such as CT, MRI, and ultrasound, enabling surgeons, radiologists, and internists to discuss and plan treatment in the same virtual environment, thereby enhancing decision accuracy and team efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Innovative Applications of MR in Environmental Design</h2>
            <p>Mixed reality technology provides environmental designers with a new way of working, allowing them to superimpose their virtual models directly onto actual spaces and view the design effects in real-time. This technology not only accelerates the design process but also enables designers, clients, and construction teams to see and evaluate design proposals in the real environment at an early stage of the project, reducing the likelihood of design changes and construction errors, and improving the overall quality and efficiency of the project.</p>

            <h2>Personalized Experiences of MR in Personal Health Management</h2>
            <p>Mixed reality technology can provide a highly personalized platform for personal health management. By combining personal health data with the real-world environment, MR applications can offer users customized health guidance and monitoring services. For example, MR glasses can display real-time movement goals and health advice in the user's field of vision based on data such as walking speed and heart rate, and can also remind users to replenish fluids or take breaks in time, thereby promoting a healthier lifestyle.</p>
