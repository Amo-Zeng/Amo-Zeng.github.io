            <h2>Exploring and Practicing Sustainable Design Review from an Interdisciplinary Integration and User Co-creation Perspective</h2>
            <p>In today's rapidly evolving society, design review is no longer confined to an internal activity within a single discipline but has gradually transformed into a comprehensive process involving multiple disciplines and dimensions. This transformation not only reflects the complexity and diversity of the design field but also embodies the higher demands of modern society for innovation and collaboration. This article will explore the significance, methods, and challenges of design review from the perspectives of interdisciplinary integration, user co-creation, and sustainability, and propose corresponding practical suggestions.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>1. The Interdisciplinary Significance of Design Review</h3>
            <p>Design review refers to the process of evaluating and providing feedback on design proposals through systematic methods during the design process. Traditional design reviews were often limited to the internal design team, with relatively singular review standards and methods. However, as the complexity of design projects increases, the knowledge and skills of a single discipline are no longer sufficient to comprehensively assess design needs. Interdisciplinary design review can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Promote Knowledge Sharing:</strong> Experts from different disciplinary backgrounds can bring their knowledge and experience from their respective fields, enriching the review perspective.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve Review Quality:</strong> Multi-disciplinary reviews can more comprehensively assess various aspects of the design, including functionality, aesthetics, and sustainability.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhance Innovation:</strong> The collision of interdisciplinary thinking helps to stimulate new ideas and solutions, promoting design innovation.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>2. Design Review from a User Co-creation Perspective</h3>
            <p>In a rapidly changing market environment, the success or failure of product design often depends on whether it can meet the real needs of users. Traditional design review processes often focus on the perspective of the internal team while neglecting the voice of the end user. Design review from a user co-creation perspective involves inviting users to participate, ensuring that the product better meets user needs and enhances user experience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Participation in the Review Process:</strong> Collect user feedback and suggestions through methods such as user interviews, surveys, and user testing. This feedback should not only include direct evaluations of the design but also cover the user's experience during use, encountered issues, and improvement suggestions.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-dimensional Review Standards:</strong> In addition to traditional design principles and technical feasibility, consider multiple dimensions such as user experience, user satisfaction, and user engagement.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Iteration and Optimization:</strong> The design team should continuously adjust and optimize the design based on user feedback, improving the user experience through rapid iteration.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Design Review from a Sustainability Perspective</h3>
            <p>Design is not only about creating beautiful and functional products but is also a significant force in promoting social progress and environmental sustainability. From a sustainability perspective, design review should focus on the following aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Impact Assessment:</strong> Evaluate the environmental impact of the design product or service throughout its lifecycle, including material selection, production process, usage phase, and disposal.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Impact Analysis:</strong> Consider the impact of the design product or service on users and society, including safety, accessibility, fairness, and cultural adaptability.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Feasibility:</strong> Assess the economic cost and potential economic benefits of the design, ensuring its economic viability while considering long-term economic sustainability.</li>
                <li><strong>Innovation and Technology:</strong> Encourage the use of new technologies and innovative methods to enhance the sustainability of the design.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>4. Integrated Approach to Interdisciplinary Integration, User Co-creation, and Sustainability</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multidisciplinary Review Team:</strong> Form a review team consisting of experts from different disciplinary backgrounds to ensure the comprehensiveness and professionalism of the review. Team members should include environmental scientists, sociologists, economists, designers, and user experience experts.</li>
                <li><strong>Structured Review Process:</strong> Design a structured review process, clearly defining the review objectives and methods for each stage to ensure the systematic and standardized nature of the review process.</li>
                <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Communication Tools:</strong> Use visualization tools, models, and prototypes to help reviewers from different disciplinary backgrounds better understand and communicate design content.</li>
                <li><strong>User Participation Mechanisms:</strong> Establish user participation mechanisms to collect user feedback and suggestions through methods such as user interviews, surveys, and user testing.</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainability Standards and Guidelines:</strong> Develop clear sustainability design standards and review guidelines to provide specific guidance and references for the design team.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Mechanisms:</strong> Establish effective feedback mechanisms to ensure that review comments are communicated to the design team in a timely and accurate manner and are implemented in subsequent designs.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>5. Practical Suggestions</h3>
            <p>To overcome the challenges of interdisciplinary integration, user co-creation, and sustainable design review and improve the effectiveness of the review, the following suggestions are offered:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Build an Interdisciplinary Culture:</strong> Cultivate a culture of interdisciplinary collaboration within the organization, encouraging personnel from different disciplinary backgrounds to learn from and communicate with each other.</li>
                <li><strong>Training and Education:</strong> Regularly organize interdisciplinary training and educational activities to help reviewers understand the basic knowledge and methods of other disciplines.</li>
                <li><strong>Clarify Review Standards:</strong> Clearly define the review standards and weights of each discipline before the review to ensure fairness and transparency.</li>
                <li><strong>Utilize Technical Tools:</strong> Use modern technical tools such as virtual reality and augmented reality to enhance the visualization and interactivity of the review.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Establish a continuous improvement mechanism to regularly evaluate and optimize the review process, ensuring its adaptability to changing design needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhance User Participation:</strong> Incentivize user participation in design review through rewards, simplified participation processes, and other methods.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimize Feedback Mechanisms:</strong> Establish effective mechanisms for collecting and processing feedback to ensure that user feedback is communicated to the design team in a timely and accurate manner.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthen User Education:</strong> Provide training and guidance to help users better understand the purpose and methods of design review, improving the quality of feedback.</li>
            </ul>
