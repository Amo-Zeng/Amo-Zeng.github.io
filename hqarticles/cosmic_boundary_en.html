            <h2>The Boundaries of the Universe: The Limits of Cognition and the Starting Point of the Unknown</h2>
            <p>Since ancient times, humanity has been filled with endless imagination and exploration regarding the boundaries of the universe. From the mythological concept of "round sky and square earth" to the modern scientific understanding of a "multi-dimensional universe," our understanding of the universe has continuously deepened, yet our quest for its boundaries has never ceased. What exactly are the boundaries of the universe? Are they the end of space, or the limits of cognition? With scientific progress, particularly the rise of quantum mechanics, multi-dimensional theories, and modern cosmology, we have gradually come to realize that the boundaries of the universe may not be a simple physical concept, but a core proposition where science and philosophy intersect, serving as the ultimate challenge to human cognition.</p>

            <h3>The Boundaries of the Universe: The End of Space or the Limits of Cognition?</h3>
            <p>Traditionally, the boundaries of the universe have been regarded as the physical limits of space, the "outside" or "end" of the universe. However, the introduction of general relativity overturned this view. Einstein's theory suggests that space-time is curved, and the universe may be finite but without boundaries, akin to a closed sphere. In other words, the universe has no definite "outside" because space itself is continuous, with no end. This perspective, while resolving the question of whether space is infinite, does not touch upon the deeper cognitive challenge: do we possess inherent limitations in our understanding of the universe?</p>
            <p>The uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics provides a profound answer. This principle states that in the microscopic world, the position and momentum of a particle cannot be simultaneously measured with precision. This "uncertainty" is not a limitation of measurement tools, but a fundamental property of the universe itself. This suggests that certain aspects of the universe may be inherently unknowable, regardless of technological advancements. The uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics tells us that the boundaries of the universe are not merely a physical issue, but a deeply cognitive one. We may never fully comprehend the essence of the universe, because it is inherently unknowable on certain levels.</p>

            <h3>A Multi-Dimensional Universe: The Hidden Boundaries Between Dimensions</h3>
            <p>With the rise of multi-dimensional universe theories, our understanding of the boundaries of the universe has entered a new dimension. String theory and brane cosmology suggest that our universe may be just one of many parallel universes, existing in different dimensions and separated by walls between dimensions. These boundaries are not just physical barriers but may also be cognitive barriers. We cannot directly perceive or observe these additional dimensions because they are beyond the scope of our cognition.</p>
            <p>The walls between dimensions lead us to rethink the essence of the boundaries of the universe. If the universe is not the four-dimensional spacetime we perceive, but a higher-dimensional existence, then the space we perceive may merely be a projection of the "true universe." These additional dimensions may subtly influence the structures of the universe we observe, yet their essence remains a mystery.</p>
