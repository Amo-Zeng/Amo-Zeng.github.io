            <h2><span class="section-number">Introduction:</span> From Individual Pathology to Civilizational Alarm</h2>
            <p>Over <span class="highlight">380 million people</span> worldwide suffer from depression (WHO, 2023), with adolescent rates increasing by nearly <span class="highlight">80%</span> over the past decade. We once attributed this to "psychological fragility" or "genetic defects," but behind these numbers lies a <span class="highlight">systemic eruption of modernity’s crisis</span>. This article argues that depression is not an individual "malfunction," but rather a <span class="highlight">somatized expression of three structural imbalances: technological mediation, ecological rupture, and temporal oppression</span>. It is a "cognitive overload syndrome" in the digital ecosystem, a "psychological trauma" in an age of disconnection from the Earth, and an "existential protest" in a society of accelerating pace. Only by integrating these three dimensions into a unified "technology–ecology–time" framework can we uncover the deep roots of depression and open the path to genuine <em>social healing</em>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2><span class="section-number">Dimension 1:</span> Technological Mediation – Cognitive Imbalance in the Digital Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>Under the triple assault of algorithmic curation, information deluge, and attention economy, the human perceptual system operates like an overloaded precision instrument, gradually losing its balance. A 2021 Stanford University study found that individuals who scroll short videos for over one hour daily exhibit a <span class="highlight">17% decline in prefrontal cortex activity</span>—the brain region responsible for rational decision-making and emotional regulation—being quietly eroded by fragmented stimuli. The capacity for delayed gratification deteriorates, and deep thinking becomes a "psychological luxury."</p>
            <p>Social media reduces self-worth to a "like count": 68% of adolescents experience self-doubt when posts receive less engagement than expected (Pew Research, 2023), forming what we call a <span class="highlight">valuation-dependent self</span>: one whose value is defined by others’ clicks, and whose meaning is measured by data traffic. This is not merely psychological alienation, but a loosening of the very foundation of existence.</p>
            <p><strong>TikTok’s "dopamine trap"</strong> exemplifies this mechanism in extremis: algorithms lock onto users’ emotional preferences within three minutes, precisely delivering content about "loneliness" or "failure," creating emotional feedback loops; content shifts every 12 seconds, preventing the brain from completing cognitive integration, causing a collapse of meaning. Data from the UK’s NHS shows a 142% rise in self-harm visits among 13–15-year-olds since 2019, with 76% directly linked to TikTok use.</p>
            <p>Platforms maximize user engagement through designs like "infinite scroll" and "autoplay," while shifting the psychological costs—depression, anxiety—onto society, constituting a form of <span class="highlight">structural psychological exploitation</span>: a capitalist logic that runs on attention and pays with mental health. The U.S. CDC estimates that depression-related healthcare costs due to digital addiction reached $48 billion in 2023, exceeding the annual public health budgets of most countries.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>"When algorithms become the scriptwriters of our emotions, depression is no longer an accident—it is the inevitable ending of the script."</strong>

            <h2><span class="section-number">Dimension 2:</span> Ecological Rupture – Somatic Trauma of Earthly Disconnection</h2>
            <p>Humans are not merely social beings, but <span class="highlight">life forms embedded in the biosphere</span>. Our neurochemistry, emotional rhythms, and immune systems are deeply intertwined with Earth’s ecology. When cities sever our connection with sunlight, soil, and seasons, depression becomes the physiological translation of "earthly disconnection"—a long-ignored <span class="highlight">somatized expression of ecological trauma</span>.</p>
            <p>Research shows that individuals with <span class="highlight">less than 30 minutes of daily nature exposure face a 47% higher risk of depression</span> (<em>JEP</em>, 2022); meanwhile, those participating weekly in community gardens show a 68% improvement in symptoms. Natural sunlight is a key catalyst for serotonin synthesis, while artificial light pollution disrupts circadian rhythms, leading to chronically elevated cortisol levels—leaving the brain in a state of constant stress, as if gripped by an invisible hand.</p>
            <p>The "absence of third places"—spaces beyond home and work, such as natural environments—leaves modern individuals in a state of <span class="highlight">existential drifting</span>. Low-income neighborhoods have only one-fifth the green space per capita compared to affluent ones, with child depression rates 2.3 times higher. This is no coincidence, but a stark proof of how ecological rupture exacerbates social inequality: access to nature is becoming a new axis of social stratification.</p>
            <p><strong>Tokyo’s "forest bathing" (shinrin-yoku)</strong> reduces cortisol by 16% and boosts NK cell activity by 50%; <strong>Singapore’s "vertical green walls and healing gardens"</strong> lower anxiety indices by 41% and achieve 83% neighbor satisfaction. These practices prove: nature is not decoration, but a "public infrastructure" for mental health—just as essential as air, water, and food.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>"We have not lost nature—we have lost the ability to resonate with life’s rhythms. And that is the deep code of depression."</strong>
            </blockquote>

            <h2><span class="section-number">Dimension 3:</span> Temporal Oppression – Existential Protest in an Accelerating Society</h2>
            <p>When time is fragmented, quantified, and commodified, depression becomes a silent resistance against "temporal violence." 87% of global workers report chronic time pressure, and 41.3% of China’s "996" employees show depressive symptoms. Society deprives us of "non-productive time"—daydreaming, slow walks, aimless reflection—precisely the moments that serve as the <span class="highlight">mental placenta</span> for psychological recovery and meaning-making.</p>
            <p>The brain’s Default Mode Network (DMN), most active during task-free states, governs self-reflection, memory integration, and future imagination. Continuous task-driven activity suppresses the DMN, leading to "meaning exhaustion." <span class="highlight">Depression is not from "too much idle time," but from "too much busy time"</span>; not from lack of drive, but from a drive system distorted into a one-dimensional efficiency machine.</p>
            <p>A Japanese programmer wrote after months of overtime: "My body is saying: 'I need to stop and mourn myself.'" In Shanghai’s top high schools, 28% of students test positive for depression, because "even grief must be scheduled." Education systems instrumentalize time, depriving youth of psychological breathing room, turning growth into a race with no rest.</p>
            <p>Time, which should be the field where life unfolds, has been alienated into an instrument of oppression. In this context, depression is an <span class="highlight">existential protest</span>—a bodily refusal to be fully instrumentalized.</p>

            <h2><span class="section-number">Integrated Solution:</span> Building a System of "Social Healing"</h2>
            <p>The way out of depression does not lie in individual "resilience," but in <span class="highlight">systemic repair of the triple ruptures</span>. We must advance a "social healing" approach—shifting from "symptom management" to "civilizational recalibration."</p>

            <h3>1. Reconstructing Technological Ethics: From Exploitation to Service</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Enact legislation requiring a "Mental Health Impact Assessment" (MIA), mandating platforms to disclose algorithmic logic and undergo independent review;</li>
                <li>Promote "slow pace mode" and "meaningful feedback" features (e.g., tracking deep reading time, creative acts);</li>
                <li>Develop "attention protection mode" to automatically block emotionally charged headlines, set usage limits, and enforce mandatory breaks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Ecological Justice Practices: From Deprivation to Empowerment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Legally guarantee the "Right to Nature": new residential areas must have ≥30% green space, with parks accessible within a 10-minute walk;</li>
                <li>Build "urban healing networks": transform abandoned spaces into community gardens, micro-forests, wetland observation points;</li>
                <li>Establish "Ecological Mourning Days," organizing public tree planting, river cleanups, and species recording—transforming grief into regenerative action.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Temporal Justice Institutions: From Oppression to Empathy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pilot "4-day workweeks," guarantee 5 annual "no-performance-review days," and allow "emotional leave";</li>
                <li>Create "slow-time public spaces": meditation kiosks, phone-free parks, "daydream benches," and "rhythm empathy corners";</li>
                <li>Introduce "time literacy courses," allowing students to apply for "flexible learning plans" that respect individual biological rhythms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Cross-Domain Collaboration: Building a "Healing Community"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Education</strong>: Integrate ecological psychology, time literacy, and digital ethics into curricula; implement "nature journals" and "slow thinking training";</li>
                <li><strong>Business</strong>: Include "digital detox," "ecological healing leave," and "rhythm empathy leave" in EAPs; encourage "no-meeting Fridays";</li>
                <li><strong>Urban Planning</strong>: Establish "digital healing spaces" and "rhythm empathy corners," supporting chronotype minorities (night owls, chronic patients, autism spectrum).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><span class="section-number">Conclusion:</span> From Treatment to Healing – A Civilizational Shift in the Depression Paradigm</h2>
            <p>Depression is not weakness—it is the body saying: <em>"I need a more humane society."</em> When we understand depression as a <span class="highlight">triple alarm of technological exploitation, ecological rupture, and temporal oppression</span>, we shift from "treating individuals" to "healing civilization." True mental health begins in a world where <span class="highlight">algorithms serve humanity, cities breathe with nature, and time embraces rhythm</span>.</p>
            <p>This is not merely a medical issue, but a civilizational responsibility in the digital age. We stand at a <span class="highlight">paradigm shift threshold</span>: from seeing depression as a "disease to eliminate" to viewing it as a "diagnostic report of civilizational imbalance." As society repairs its technological ecology, rebuilds ecological bonds, and reconstructs temporal justice, depression may transform from a "symptom" into an <span class="highlight">awakening signal</span>, from a "burden" into a <span class="highlight">catalyst for change</span>.</p>
            <p>In the future, we may witness a <span class="highlight">"paradigm shift in depression"</span>—from a "treatment paradigm" to a "healing paradigm":</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Treatment Paradigm</strong>: Focuses on individuals, relies on medication and counseling, attempts to "fix malfunctions" within unchanged structures;</li>
                <li><strong>Healing Paradigm</strong>: Reconstructs society, built on technological ethics, ecological justice, and temporal empathy—<span class="highlight">environments themselves become healing agents</span>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Under this new paradigm, cities will no longer be breeding grounds for depression, but <span class="highlight">generators of mental health</span>; technology will no longer be a predator of attention, but a <span class="highlight">collaborator in meaning-making</span>; time will no longer be a prison of oppression, but <span class="highlight">fertile ground for life’s unfolding</span>.</p>
            <p><strong>True healing is not about making everyone "happy," but about making society "inhabitable."</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Only when the Earth becomes our therapist again, when time regains its poetry, and when technology returns to its human roots, can we truly emerge from depression and step into a deeper, more symbiotic form of civilization—one that allows grief, respects rhythm, and embraces nature; a civilization that has finally learned to listen to the body’s voice.</strong></p>
            <div class="final-quote">
                <strong>"Depression is not the price of modernity—it is its most honest echo."</strong><br>
                <strong>Healing depression ultimately requires a civilizational re-enchantment.</strong>
            </div>
            <p>We will come to understand: <strong>The end of depression is not an individual victory, but the beginning of humanity relearning how to coexist with itself, with nature, and with time.</strong><br>In this civilizational self-redemption, every gaze into nature, every moment of aimless contemplation, every act of honoring rhythm—is the gentlest resistance against depression, and the quiet foundation of a new world.</p>
