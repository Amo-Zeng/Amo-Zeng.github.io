            <h2>Prologue: Pandemic as Developer Solution</h2>
            <p>When Shanghai programmers are trapped by electronic fences scanning "space-time companions," when Berlin cafés fracture consensus in public spaces over vaccine passport disputes, when Tokyo's isolated elderly suffer cognitive regression through physical isolation – what we witness are not mere side effects of pandemic control, but the blue screen of death looming over modern civilization's operating system. This 21st-century global black swan materializes Beck's risk society into an existential experiment – our self-built material barriers and rational doctrines revealing sharp edges of reverse imprisonment under viral mutation.</p>

            <h2>I. Data Leviathan: Divination Politics in Algorithmic Theocracy</h2>
            <p>The 2022 health code misjudgment frenzy shattered the myth of technological neutrality. The Zhengzhou red code incident saw 9,000 rural bank depositors' civic identities evaporate in algorithmic black boxes, a perfect illustration of Agamben's "bare life." Daily production of 6.4‰ digital displaced persons in this era of over-surveillance and accidental abandonment validates Byung-Chul Han's warning: "The transparent society kills not secrets, but the breathing space essential to existence."</p>
            <p>European vaccine passport debates mirror our era's paradoxes. When data contracts techno-kidnap civic identities under public safety pretexts, Paris court's constitutional ruling touches civilization's ultimate contradiction: as human respiration becomes binary existence certificates, Habermas' "colonization of the lifeworld" achieves quantum leaps. Professor Saito's "digital indulgences" concept resonates – people ritually sacrifice biometrics before cameras, seeking data asceticism to redeem mobility rights usurped by algorithms.</p>
