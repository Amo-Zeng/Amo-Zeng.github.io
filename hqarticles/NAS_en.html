            <h3>Part One: Evolution of NAS</h3>
            <p>The concept of NAS dates back to the 1990s, with the spread of the internet and the increasing storage needs of businesses, NAS was born. Early NAS devices were primarily used for file sharing and simple backup functions. As technology advanced, the functionality of NAS expanded:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial Phase</strong>: NAS mainly served as a file server, providing basic file storage and sharing services.</li>
                <li><strong>Development Phase</strong>: With the maturation of SMB (Server Message Block) and NFS (Network File System) protocols, NAS could work seamlessly in heterogeneous networks, supporting more operating systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Intelligent Phase</strong>: Modern NAS not only provides storage but also integrates data protection, RAID technology, cloud syncing, and other advanced features.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: NAS has evolved from a simple file sharing tool into a multifunctional storage solution, with its core value being efficient, reliable, and flexible data management.</p>
