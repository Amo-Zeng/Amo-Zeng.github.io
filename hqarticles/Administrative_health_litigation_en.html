            <h2>Health法治 in the Digital Era: Dilemmas, Challenges, and Reconstruction</h2>
            <p>Under the global wave of digitalization, the healthcare sector is undergoing profound changes. The widespread application of new technologies such as electronic health records, telemedicine, and medical big data has not only significantly improved healthcare efficiency but also brought unprecedented opportunities for public health management. However, as technology deepens its application, the boundaries between law and ethics are increasingly blurred, and issues such as citizen rights, the legitimate rights and interests of medical practitioners, and the boundaries of administrative power are becoming more prominent. This article will explore the reconstruction paths of health法治 in the digital era from three dimensions: the dilemmas of digital healthcare, the expansion of power and rights protection in public health events, and cross-regional, cross-departmental health administrative litigation.</p>

            <h3>Dilemmas of Digital Healthcare: Balancing Efficiency and Justice</h3>
            <p>The application of digital healthcare has brought revolutionary changes to the medical industry. The popularization of electronic health records allows medical information to be efficiently stored and shared, telemedicine breaks through spatial and temporal restrictions, and medical big data provides a scientific basis for personalized treatment. However, behind the advancement of technology lies a complex legal and ethical dilemma.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Privacy Risks of Electronic Health Records:</strong> While improving healthcare efficiency, it also brings risks of patient privacy leakage.</li>
                <li><strong>Liability Determination in Telemedicine:</strong> Physical distance increases the uncertainty of information transmission, making medical disputes more difficult to handle.</li>
                <li><strong>Ownership of Medical Big Data:</strong> Patients' health data may be commercialized, raising questions about data ownership and usage rights.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Power Expansion and Rights Protection in Public Health Events</h3>
            <p>Public health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, are not only a test for the healthcare system but also a challenge for the legal system. In emergency situations, the government often takes a series of unconventional measures, such as mandatory quarantine, lockdown of epidemic areas, and requisition of medical resources. These measures play an important role in containing the spread of the epidemic and ensuring public safety, but they also raise concerns about the expansion of power and the protection of citizens' rights.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Power Expansion in Emergency Situations:</strong> Improves response efficiency but may also lead to abuse of power.</li>
                <li><strong>Protection of Citizens' Rights:</strong> How to protect the fundamental rights of citizens in emergency situations becomes a core issue.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenges in Health Administrative Litigation:</strong> The rights relief mechanism in emergency situations needs urgent improvement.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Cross-Regional, Cross-Departmental Collaboration in Health Administrative Litigation</h3>
            <p>With the acceleration of globalization and the development of domestic socio-economy, the complexity and diversity of health administrative management are increasing. Health administrative litigation, as a legal means to supervise health administrative actions and protect citizens' health rights, is also facing challenges in cross-regional and cross-departmental collaboration.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regional Differences:</strong> There are significant differences in health administrative management models across regions, leading to diversity and complexity in health administrative actions.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Regional Collaboration:</strong> Cross-regional health events require health administrative departments to collaborate across regions, and corresponding administrative litigation also needs cross-regional collaboration.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Reconstruction of Health法治 in the Digital Era</h3>
            <p>The reconstruction of health法治 in the digital era needs to find a balance between technological progress and legal improvement. Specifically, it should be addressed from the following aspects:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Clarify Legal Boundaries of Digital Healthcare:</strong> Protect patient privacy and data rights, and provide legal protection for medical practitioners.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve Rights Relief Mechanisms in Emergency Situations:</strong> Ensure that citizens can obtain timely and effective legal relief in emergency situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Build Cross-Regional, Cross-Departmental Collaboration Mechanisms:</strong> Ensure the fairness and efficiency of health administrative litigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthen Judicial Review and Supervision:</strong> Ensure that administrative power operates within the framework of the rule of law.</li>
            </ol>
