            <h2>From "Presence" to "Information": Multidimensional Exploration at the Cosmic Scale</h2>
            <p>When we gaze at the stars, the vastness of the universe always evokes a profound sense of insignificance. This feeling does not stem from our own smallness, but rather from our abstract perception of the cosmic scale. Traditionally, the scale of the universe is described in terms of physical distances like light-years and millions of light-years. While precise, this expression often fails to resonate with our emotional depths. To better understand the grandeur of the universe, we need to start with "presence," combine it with the perspective of information theory, redefine the cosmic scale, and construct a "cosmic scale pyramid" to reveal humanity's unique position and cognitive limits within the universe.</p>

            <h3>Redefining Scale: Cosmic Understanding from the Perspective of "Presence"</h3>
            <p>Traditional descriptions of the cosmic scale rely on abstract concepts of physical distances and time spans, such as the distance between galaxies measured in light-years. However, this expression often feels cold and distant, as it transcends our everyday experience. To better grasp the vastness of the universe, we need to approach it from the perspective of "presence," transforming abstract physical distances into concrete time and emotional experiences.</p>
            <p>An effective method is to convert physical distances into "viewing time." For instance, imagine how many nights it would take to observe a distant star moving from one end of the horizon to the other with the naked eye. In this way, the distance between galaxies is no longer a cold number but a tangible reality we can perceive. When we realize that observing a distant star might take years or even decades, we not only feel the expanse of the universe but also the passage of time and the brevity of life. This emotional resonance allows us to more deeply appreciate the dynamics of the universe and the preciousness of life.</p>
            <p>By defining the cosmic scale through "viewing time," we can more intuitively sense the movement and changes in the universe, and better understand its dynamics. The movement of stars and the evolution of galaxies are no longer abstract scientific concepts but phenomena we can perceive. This shift in cognitive approach not only helps us better understand the universe but also inspires deep reflections on life, time, and existence.</p>

            <h3>Quantifying Cosmic Complexity: Information Theory Perspective on Cosmic Exploration</h3>
            <p>Traditional descriptions of the cosmic scale, such as the number of galaxies, the mass of black holes, and the distribution of dark energy, paint a grand picture of the universe. However, these physical parameters only outline the "skeleton" of the universe, failing to capture its intricate "flesh." Information theory offers a new perspective, allowing us to quantify the information content and complexity of the universe and thus gain a more comprehensive understanding of its essence.</p>
            <p>One of the core concepts of information theory is "entropy," which measures the uncertainty and information content of a system. In the context of the universe, entropy can be understood as the number of all possible states within it. For example, considering all the particles in the universe, each particle can exist in different positions, velocities, and spin states, resulting in an astronomical number of combinations, leading to a very high entropy value for the universe.</p>
            <p>Through the lens of information theory, we can quantify the information content of the universe. For instance, counting the number of different types of celestial bodies and their interactions can be seen as the transmission of information. The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), as the "afterglow" left by the Big Bang, is an important source of information about the early state of the universe. By precisely measuring and analyzing the CMB, we can extract crucial information about the geometry of the universe, its composition, and initial conditions.</p>
            <p>Quantifying cosmic complexity from the perspective of information theory not only provides a more comprehensive description of the universe's intricacy but also offers new insights into understanding the origin, evolution, and future fate of the universe. For example, by analyzing changes in the information content of the universe during different evolutionary stages, we can gain a deeper understanding of major events such as the Big Bang, inflation, and dark energy. Additionally, information theory supports the exploration of multiverse hypotheses and cosmic simulation theories, revealing the possibility that we may be living in a computer simulation created by an advanced civilization.</p>

            <h3>Exploring the Unknown Mirror: Constructing a Cosmic Scale Pyramid from the Human Perspective</h3>
            <p>Traditional descriptions of the cosmic scale often center around Earth and arrange distances by proximity, neglecting humanity's unique position and cognitive limitations within the universe. To truly understand the universe, we need a deeper perspective: starting from human cognitive abilities, constructing a "cosmic scale pyramid" to serve as a mirror for exploring the unknown, reflecting humanity's position in the universe and our endless pursuit of the unknown world.</p>
            <p>The "cosmic scale pyramid" can be divided into three levels:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Foundation of Cognition: Scale of Perception and Understanding</strong>  
                    The base of the pyramid represents the scale that humans can directly perceive and understand. This level includes the microscopic world of atoms, molecules, and cells, as well as the macroscopic environment of Earth, atmosphere, and oceans. These are the substances and phenomena we encounter in daily life, forming the foundation of human cognition.</li>
                <li><strong>Wings of Tools: Scale of Observation and Research</strong>  
                    The middle layer of the pyramid represents the scale that humans can observe and research through tools and technology. This level includes celestial systems such as stars, planets, galaxies, and star clusters, as well as extreme physical phenomena like gravitational waves and black holes. Advanced instruments such as telescopes, radio telescopes, and particle accelerators allow us to transcend the limitations of our senses, observing more distant, smaller, and complex celestial bodies and phenomena.</li>
                <li><strong>Summit of the Unknown: Scale of Transcendence and Exploration</strong>  
                    The top layer of the pyramid represents the scale that humans currently cannot directly observe or understand. This level includes concepts such as multiverses, parallel universes, and spacetime singularities, as well as potentially existing other dimensions and physical laws. These concepts far exceed our current observational capabilities and theoretical frameworks, fueling humanity's deepest exploratory desires.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The "cosmic scale pyramid" is not only a scientific tool but also a profound philosophical metaphor. It reveals the limitations and infinity of human cognitive abilities. Our cognitive abilities are both limited and infinite: limited in that we cannot directly perceive or understand all phenomena, infinite in that we can always break through known boundaries and discover new cognitive domains. This dialectical relationship reflects humanity's unique position in the universe: we are both a part of the universe and its observers and explorers.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Multidimensional Exploration of Cosmic Scale</h3>
            <p>By redefining the cosmic scale from "presence," combining it with the perspective of information theory to quantify cosmic complexity, and constructing the "cosmic scale pyramid," we are not only exploring the vastness of the universe but also our inner world. This exploration is not just about understanding the universe but also about self-awareness.</p>
            <p>In this infinitely vast universe, our cognitive journey has just begun. Each unknown puzzle serves as a guiding light for our progress, and every new discovery redefines the universe and ourselves. Just as the universe is boundless, our exploration of it will also be endless.</p>
