            <h2>Multidimensional Exploration of War Crimes: Ecological, Psychological Cultural Heritage, and Digital War Crimes</h2>
            <p>War, as a shadow over human history, not only destroys lives and property at a physical level but also leaves inestimable scars in ecological, psychological, and cultural heritage, as well as in digital spaces. This article aims to delve into the multifaceted impacts of war crimes and the legal challenges they face from three dimensions: ecological war crimes, war crimes against psychological and cultural heritage, and digital war crimes.</p>

            <h3>Ecological War Crimes: The Profound Impact of War on the Environment and Its Legal Consequences</h3>
            <p>War is not merely a conflict between humans; it is also a massive destruction of the Earth's ecosystems. Here are several aspects demonstrating how war affects the environment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chemical Weapons and Ecological Destruction:</strong> For example, Agent Orange used during the Vietnam War, which contains dioxin, led to widespread land pollution, devastation of forest ecosystems, and long-term negative health effects on humans, including cancer, fertility issues, and developmental abnormalities.</li>
                <li><strong>Pollution and Ecosystem Destruction:</strong> During the Bosnian War, the destruction of industrial facilities resulted in chemical spills, severely polluting rivers and damaging aquatic ecosystems, subsequently affecting communities dependent on these water sources.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although international legal documents like the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions explicitly prohibit unnecessary environmental destruction, there are numerous difficulties in their enforcement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition and Priority Issues:</strong> The definition of war crimes mainly focuses on direct harm to human life, often considering environmental destruction as a secondary issue.</li>
                <li><strong>Assessment and Documentation:</strong> Environmental destruction is a long-term process, making it challenging to accurately assess and document during the war.</li>
                <li><strong>Jurisdiction and Evidence:</strong> International law has deficiencies in jurisdiction and evidence collection, making many acts of environmental destruction hard to prosecute.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To effectively address ecological war crimes, the future requires:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Redefining War Crimes:</strong> Incorporating environmental destruction into the core definition, and establishing specific assessment standards and penalties.</li>
                <li><strong>Establishing Specialized Agencies:</strong> To monitor and evaluate the impact of war on the environment, providing technical support and legal aid.</li>
                <li><strong>International Cooperation:</strong> Strengthening cooperation between governments and international organizations to jointly formulate and enforce international environmental protection laws.</li>
            </ol>
