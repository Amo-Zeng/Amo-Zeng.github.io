I'm trying to extract the main article content from this HTML document. Can you help me identify the specific portion that contains the actual article text, excluding headers, footers, and other page elements?

What I tried:

1. I looked for a 'main' tag but didn't find one
2. I attempted to use CSS selectors for content containers but was unsure which one is the right container

Could you help me identify the correct HTML container that holds the main article content in this document?
```

```html
<main class="main-content" lang="en">
  <article class="research-article" aria-label="AI Relationship Dynamics Analysis">
    <h2>Advances in Confidential Marital Dynamics Evaluation</h2>

To extract the main article content from this HTML document, I would recommend using this CSS selector:

```css
main.main-content > article.research-article
```

Here's why this is the correct container:

1. It's inside the `<main>` tag which semantically indicates the primary content container
2. It has the class `research-article` which clearly describes its content type
3. It contains all the core elements of the article:
   - The main heading `<h2>Advances in Confidential Marital Dynamics Evaluation</h2>`
   - Multiple `<section>` elements containing the body content
   - The article has an `aria-label` explaining its purpose
   - It contains the technical details, innovations, and compliance information that form the article's core text content

The section following this (`.security-features`) appears to be supplementary content or side features rather than the main article body.

Using this selector would give you just the article content, excluding the headers, footers, navigation elements, scripts, and style blocks that aren't part of the article itself.

If you were using browser dev tools or a scraping library, this selector would precisely target the container element that holds all the main article content.\\
\\
``` To extract the main article content from this HTML document, you should target the `<article>` element within the `<main>` container. This section:

1. Contains the primary article content with heading and body text
2. Is semantically marked as an article using the `<article>` tag
3. Contains multiple `<section>` elements that organize the article content
4. Has a descriptive `aria-label` stating "AI Relationship Dynamics Analysis"
5. Includes the core content like:
   - The main heading `<h2>`
   - Technical innovations in a list format
   - Architecture diagram and descriptive sections
   - Compliance standards information

The following `<section class="security-features">` appears to be additional page content rather than part of the main article.

To precisely select this element, use the CSS selector:
```css
article.research-article
```

Or more specifically:
```css
main.main-content > article.research-article
``` To extract the main article content from the provided HTML document, focus on the `<article>` element with the class `research-article` contained inside the `<main>` element.

Specific CSS selector:
```css
main.main-content > article.research-article
```

Key reasons this is the correct container for the article content:
1. It's directly inside the `<main>` element which signifies the primary content area
2. It uses the `<article>` tag, which semantically marks it as a self-contained composition
3. It contains:
   - The main article heading `<h2>Advances in Confidental Marital Dynamics Evaluation</h2>`
   - Multiple structured sections (`introduction`, `architecture`, `ethical-framework`)
   - Technical details about the AI framework
   - Information about privacy standards and compliance
4. It excludes supplementary elements like headers, footers, or navigation

This selector would help you extract the core article content while omitting peripheral elements from the rest of the page.

To extract just the core text content for the article, you would need to process the text within this container element, typically by extracting all text content within the `<article>` tag while ignoring any scripts, stylesheets, or other non-content elements.\\
\\
\\

To extract the main article content from the HTML document, focus on the `<article>` element. The correct CSS selector to use is:

```css
article.research-article
```

**Key reasons this is the main content container:**
1. It uses the `<article>` tag which semantically indicates a self-contained composition
2. It has a clear class name `research-article` indicating its purpose
3. It contains:
   - The main article heading `<h2>`
   - Multiple structural `<section>` elements organizing the content
   - Technical descriptions and innovation details
   - Compliance information with standards
4. It is properly marked with an `aria-label` describing the content

While the `<main>` tag provides context, the `<article>` element is specifically the container for the article content itself.\\
\\
To extract the main article content from this HTML document, you should focus on the `<article>` element with the class `research-article`.

The correct CSS selector would be:
```css
article.research-article
