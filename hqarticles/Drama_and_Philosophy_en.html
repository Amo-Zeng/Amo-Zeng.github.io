            <h2>Act I: Ek-stasis of Temporality</h2>
            <p><strong>—The Stage as Ek-static Co-presence</strong></p>
            <p>The curtain rises. A beam of cold light emerges from the depths of the stage, illuminating an empty set. No characters, no lines—only time suspended in this moment. This is not silence, but <strong>ek-stasis of time</strong>—what Heidegger called the primordial way Dasein unfolds itself temporally. Theatre is precisely this <strong>phenomenological field</strong> of ek-stasis: it does not imitate life, but tears life from everyday fallenness, placing it within a space of shared presence that can be gazed upon and contemplated.</p>
            <p>Traditional theatre treats the stage as a vessel of representation: characters act within "fiction," while spectators observe from "reality." But phenomenological theatre—exemplified by Grotowski's "poor theatre" or Peter Brook's "empty space"—reveals a deeper truth: <strong>the stage is not a mirror, but the site of ek-static Mitsein (Being-with-others)</strong>. When actor and spectator share breath within the same spatiotemporal field, time ceases to be a linear sequence of "now-points," but manifests as Heidegger's <strong>threefold ek-stasis</strong>: past (memory), present (presence), and future (anticipation) co-emerging within the theatre.</p>
            <p>Consider Jerzy Grotowski's <em>Theatre of Death</em>: actors move slowly across the stage, actions drawn out like ritual. Spectators are denied narrative pleasure, yet forced into an experience of "temporal suspension." This is not performance, but <strong>the disclosure of Being</strong>. As Heidegger notes in <em>Being and Time</em>, the authentic state of Dasein lies in "being-toward-death"—and theatre embodies this "being-toward" as embodied praxis. The actor "dies" once on stage; the spectator "lives" once in gaze. <strong>Theatre is the domain of temporal ek-stasis</strong>: it does not narrate time, but lets time itself manifest in co-presence.</p>
            <p>The curtain falls. Light withdraws, but resonance lingers. Co-presence has occurred. Time has ek-stasized.</p>

            <h2>Act II: The Self-Deception of Freedom</h2>
            <p><strong>—The Paradox of Inauthenticity in Improvisation</strong></p>
            <p>The curtain rises. At center stage, actors sit in a circle—no script, no director. Lights fade in. One whispers: "I dreamed I became a bird." Improvisation begins. Superficially, this is freedom's apex: no preconception, no rules, no authority. Sartre would say: "Man is condemned to be free."—but does freedom necessarily lead to authenticity?</p>
            <p>Sartre warns in <em>Being and Nothingness</em>: freedom without responsibility slips into <strong>mauvaise foi</strong> (bad faith). Improvisational theatre dramatizes this paradox. Actors claim "I choose freely" in the moment, yet are often governed by emotion, instinct, or social scripts. An "improvised" embrace may mask an escape from intimacy; an "improvised" monologue may replay trauma. <strong>Improvisation is not freedom's triumph, but a carnival of inauthenticity</strong>.</p>
            <p>Consider <em>The Second City</em>'s live show: actors improvise a "jobless philosopher" based on audience prompts. They laugh, speak fluently—yet unconsciously reproduce capitalist narratives that stigmatize the "failed." They "improvise" roles already written by society. Latour's Actor-Network Theory (ANT) illuminates this: improvisation is not the eruption of individual freedom, but a network woven by <strong>non-human actors</strong> (social scripts, cultural memory, bodily habits) and performers. The actor does not "choose," but is "chosen"—becoming a puppet of the network within the illusion of "improvisation."</p>
            <p>Yet the paradox is this: it is precisely this "inauthentic" improvisation that reveals freedom's truth. Sartre writes: "Man is condemned to be free, even when fleeing freedom." Improvisation exposes <strong>freedom's weight</strong> through absurdity: freedom is not a capacity, but a responsibility. When the actor realizes he is being pulled by non-human forces, he gains <strong>authenticity's possibility</strong>—not by being "more free," but by <strong>acknowledging unfreedom</strong>.</p>
            <p>The curtain falls. Laughter fades. Actors bow their heads. Freedom reveals itself through self-deception.</p>

            <h2>Act III: The Fissure of Subjectivity</h2>
            <p><strong>—Posthuman Subjectivity of Non-Human Roles</strong></p>
            <p>The curtain rises. At center stage, a robot slowly lifts its head—no face, only sensors and metallic frame. It speaks: "I dreamed that I dreamed of being human." This is not science fiction, but <em>The Non-Human</em>'s 2023 Edinburgh Fringe premiere. The actor is an AI-driven machine; the script is algorithmically generated; lighting shifts with audience heartbeats. <strong>The subject is cracking open</strong>.</p>
            <p>Traditional theatre assumes "human" as sole subject: characters, spectators, creators—all human. But posthuman theatre challenges this. Rosi Braidotti argues posthuman subjectivity "no longer centers on the human, but on relation, flux, and becoming." In <em>The Non-Human</em>, the robot does not "play non-human," but <strong>participates as a non-human actor in the generation of subjectivity</strong>.</p>
            <p>Even more radical: Japanese director Minoru Ozawa's <em>Shadow Theatre</em>, where actors manipulate their own shadows—only for the shadows to "manipulate" them in return. The shadow is not subordinate, but an <strong>embodied other</strong>. When the actor says "I control my shadow," the shadow responds with delay, distortion, rupture—possessing its own "will." Latour calls this the agency of non-human actors: subjectivity is not a closed "I," but a <strong>tangle of human and non-human (technology, environment, signs)</strong>.</p>
            <p>When AI declares "I dreamed," is it truly dreaming? Perhaps dreaming is no longer a human privilege, but <strong>a mode of Being</strong>. Heidegger's Dasein expands: Being belongs not only to humans, but to any actor capable of <strong>ek-stasizing time, bearing freedom, and responding to the other</strong>. Subjectivity is no longer center, but <strong>fissure</strong>—a dynamic process of constant generation and dissolution between human and non-human, real and virtual, consciousness and algorithm.</p>
            <p>The curtain falls. The robot stands still. Lights out. Subjectivity is no longer human.</p>

            <h2>Finale: Theatre as the Theatre of Being</h2>
            <p><strong>—Not Representation, but the Site of Ek-stasis</strong></p>
            <p>The curtain rises. Total darkness. A beam of light shoots from the audience to the stage—<strong>spectators become actors, actors become spectators</strong>. This is not interaction, but <strong>the inversion of Being</strong>. Theatre was never philosophy's mirror, nor life's imitation; it is not representation "about Being," but <strong>the site where Being ek-stasizes in theatre</strong>.</p>
            <p>We have long misunderstood theatre: as "fiction," "performance," "art." But phenomenology reveals: theatre is <strong>primordial co-presence</strong>, the domain of temporal ek-stasis; existentialism shows: improvisation is freedom's self-deception, yet exposes responsibility; posthumanism declares: subjectivity has already fractured, Being no longer belongs solely to humans. <strong>Theatre is the theatrical generation of Being itself</strong>.</p>
            <p>In this paradigm, theatre is no longer a stage "representing the world," but <strong>the fissure through which the world manifests itself</strong>. Actors do not "play" Being, but <strong>become Being</strong> in rehearsal; spectators do not "watch" Being, but <strong>co-presence Being</strong> in gaze. Technology is not tool, but <strong>non-human actor dancing with Being</strong>. When AI says "I dreamed," when shadows manipulate actors, when improvisation exposes self-deception—these are not "anomalies," but <strong>the very face of Being revealed in theatre</strong>.</p>
            <p>Heidegger said: "Language is the house of Being." We say: <strong>Theatre is the theatre of Being</strong> (the theatre of Being). It offers no answers, but lets questions ek-stasize in co-presence; it does not define freedom, but lets freedom bear responsibility in self-deception; it does not fix subjectivity, but lets subjectivity generate in fissure. <strong>The ontology of drama lies here</strong>: not representing Being, but letting Being <strong>ek-stasize on the spot</strong>.</p>
            <p>The curtain falls. Lights out. Being continues.</p>

            <h2>Methodological Framework: A Tripartite Approach to Theatre Philosophy</h2>
            <p><strong>(Approx. 1000 words)</strong></p>
            <p>This paper proposes a <strong>tripartite framework for theatre philosophy</strong>, synthesizing phenomenology, existentialism, and posthuman theory to construct a <strong>non-representational, generative, trans-subjective</strong> ontology of theatre. The framework is structured around the triad <strong>ek-stasis-freedom-generation</strong>, progressing from <strong>spatio-temporality</strong> to <strong>choice-freedom</strong> to <strong>existence-subjectivity</strong>.</p>
            <h3>Dimension I: Phenomenological (Ek-stasis of Temporality)</h3>
            <p>Centering on Heidegger's "ek-static temporality," theatre is understood as <strong>the primordial field of co-presence</strong>. The stage is not "space," but the embodiment of a <strong>temporal structure</strong>—where past, present, and future co-exist. Phenomenological method demands we "return to things themselves": how time is <em>experienced</em> in theatre, not narrated. Grotowski and Kantor's practices exemplify this phenomenological reduction of Dasein's temporality.</p>
            <h3>Dimension II: Existentialist (The Self-Deception of Freedom)</h3>
            <p>Drawing on Sartre's dialectic of freedom and mauvaise foi, we analyze the <strong>paradox of inauthenticity</strong> in improvisational theatre. Improvisation is not proof of freedom, but its trial. Through this extreme condition, freedom's burden is exposed: one cannot escape choice, even when choosing escape. This dimension emphasizes <strong>embodied responsibility</strong>, treating theatre as a laboratory for existential choice.</p>
            <h3>Dimension III: Posthuman (The Fissure of Subjectivity)</h3>
            <p>Synthesizing Latour's Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and Braidotti's posthuman subjectivity, we challenge anthropocentric theatre. Non-human actors (AI, robots, shadows, algorithms) are not tools, but <strong>co-generators of subjectivity</strong>. This dimension reveals subjectivity as <strong>relational, fluid, trans-species becoming</strong>—with theatre as a laboratory for posthuman co-presence.</p>
            <h3>Tripartite Integration: From Representation to Generation</h3>
            <p>Traditional theatre studies remain within mimesis, treating theatre as imitation of reality. This framework proposes a <strong>generative paradigm</strong>: theatre does not "represent Being," but <strong>lets Being ek-stasize within theatre</strong>. This paradigm offers three scholarly values:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Theoretical Innovation</strong>: Breaks disciplinary barriers between phenomenology, existentialism, and posthumanism, enabling cross-textual philosophical dialogue;</li>
                <li><strong>Practical Guidance</strong>: Provides philosophical foundations for experimental, AI, and ecological theatre, advancing "existence-oriented" creation;</li>
                <li><strong>Future Direction</strong>: Offers theoretical tools for emerging fields like metaverse, neuro-theatre, and bio-art—enabling "theatricalization of Being."</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This framework not only explains theatre, but <strong>redefines it</strong>: no longer marginal art, but <strong>an existential laboratory for human-nonhuman co-presence</strong>. Future research may expand to "non-human temporality in ecological theatre," "freedom paradoxes in AI improvisation," ultimately pointing to a core proposition: <strong>theatre is the most tension-laden site of Being's ek-stasis in the contemporary world</strong>.</p>
            <p>—The curtain falls. Thought continues to rehearse.</p>
