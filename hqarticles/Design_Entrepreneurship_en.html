            <h3>1. Integration of Sustainable Design and Social Innovation</h3>
            <p>Design entrepreneurship is not just about creating products or services; it's a key means to solve global issues. Here are several ways to achieve this through design entrepreneurship:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Development of Biodegradable Packaging:</strong> For example, Mushroom Packaging uses mycelium to create naturally decomposing packaging materials, reducing carbon footprints and opening new markets for businesses.</li>
                <li><strong>Redesigning with Waste Materials:</strong> Projects like Recycled Plastic Furniture transform discarded plastic bottles into furniture, promoting environmental sustainability while creating economic and social value.</li>
                <li><strong>Designing Low-Cost, Sustainable Products for Impoverished Areas:</strong> Products like the LifeStraw water purifier address drinking water issues in impoverished areas through simple and economical design.</li>
                <li><strong>Combining Design Thinking with Social Entrepreneurship:</strong> Design entrepreneurs use design thinking methods like empathy, creativity, prototyping, and iteration, along with social entrepreneurship, to create self-sustaining business models that also deliver social benefits.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. The Customized Future of AI-Assisted Design</h3>
            <p>Advancements in AI technology have shifted design from mass production to personalized customization, introducing new business models and challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Collection and Analysis:</strong> AI analyzes user behavior and preferences to generate designs that meet personalized needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Customized Design Generation:</strong> AI can produce designs based on specific user requirements, such as home or clothing designs.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Interaction and Adjustment:</strong> With AI's real-time feedback, users can adjust designs for increased satisfaction.</li>
                <li><strong>New Business Models:</strong> Subscription-based design services, smart design platforms, and DIY design tools cater to consumer demands for personalization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, the application of AI in design also brings challenges like data privacy, the transformation of the designer's role, and user acceptance. In the future, design companies will need to protect user privacy while educating the market about this new technology.</p>
