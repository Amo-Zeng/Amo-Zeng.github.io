            <h2>Introduction: From Landscape to Agent — The Paradigm Shift of Gardens</h2>
            <p>In traditional garden history, gardens have always been projections of human will: symbols of royal power (e.g., Versailles), spiritual retreats for literati (e.g., the Humble Administrator’s Garden), or urban leisure spaces (e.g., city parks). At their core, they are <span class="highlight">anthropocentric landscape apparatuses</span>—nature disciplined, time compressed, bodies visualized, society symbolized. However, under the triple crisis of the <span class="highlight">Anthropocene</span>—<strong>climate acceleration, cognitive colonization, and geopolitical conflict</strong>—the garden is undergoing a fundamental paradigm shift: it is no longer a passive "object of viewing," but an active "<strong>ecological agent</strong>."</p>
            <p>At the heart of this shift is the transformation of gardens from "<strong>human monologue</strong>" to "<strong>multispecies dialogue</strong>." This article proposes the philosophical vision of the <span class="highlight">posthuman garden</span>, defined as: <strong>a dynamic, responsive network jointly constituted by human and non-human actors (trees, microbes, water, wind, soil) that actively participates in ecological governance</strong>. This vision not only redefines the function of gardens but also challenges the deeply entrenched <strong>human exceptionalism</strong> of modernity, opening a new <span class="highlight">de-anthropocentric ethics of governance</span>.</p>

            <h2>Analytical Framework: Three Dimensions of Crisis and Three Forms of Response</h2>
            <p>To systematically articulate the transformative logic of posthuman gardens, this article proposes a tripartite analytical framework—“<strong>ecological—bodily—social</strong>”—corresponding to the deep structure of contemporary crises and their garden-based responses:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Crisis Dimension</th>
                    <th>Nature of Crisis</th>
                    <th>Garden Response Mechanism</th>
                    <th>Core Metaphor</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Ecological Dimension</strong></td>
                    <td>Time acceleration & ecological rupture</td>
                    <td><strong>Ecological Time Capsule</strong></td>
                    <td>Anchoring slow time, redefining intergenerational contracts</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Bodily Dimension</strong></td>
                    <td>Perception colonized by technology</td>
                    <td><strong>Cognitive Antidote</strong></td>
                    <td>Rebuilding embodied contemplation</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Social Dimension</strong></td>
                    <td>Geopolitical conflict & cultural fragmentation</td>
                    <td><strong>Soil Diplomacy</strong></td>
                    <td>Activating underground biopolitics</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>These dimensions are not parallel but dynamically coupled through the <span class="highlight">agency of non-human actors</span>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tree rings are not only climatic archives but material carriers of "time capsules," with their carbon sequestration directly participating in ecological governance;</li>
                <li>Mycorrhizal networks not only regulate soil perception but serve as physiological foundations for "cognitive detox"—microbial metabolites (e.g., tryptophan-serotonin pathways) influence human neural activity;</li>
                <li>Microbial cross-border migration transcends national boundaries and mediates social trust through "non-linguistic communication," enabling "<strong>diplomacy without a foreign ministry</strong>."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This framework is grounded in <span class="highlight">Latour’s Actor-Network Theory (ANT)</span>: nature and society, human and non-human, are <span class="highlight">symmetrical actors</span> co-constructing networks. It also responds to Habermas’s theory of the <strong>colonization of the lifeworld</strong>—as technological systems datafy perception, memory, and relationships, gardens become <span class="highlight">reterritorialized spaces of the lifeworld</span>, resisting systemic abstraction through embodied practice.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>I. Ecological Dimension: Time Capsules and Ecological Entanglement</h2>
            <p>Traditional gardens rely on "instant aesthetics"—cherry blossoms lasting seven days, peonies blooming for ten—where beauty lies in transience, yet obscures the deep temporality of ecosystems. Contemporary gardens transform into <span class="highlight">ecological time capsules</span>, incorporating non-human temporal scales: tree rings, soil deposition, groundwater cycles. For example, the Dutch "Garden of Time" centers on century-old oaks, whose root systems form cross-century carbon sinks, creating "<strong>living carbon vaults</strong>"; Shenzhen’s "Climate Memory Garden" uses tree-ring slices and glacial sedimentary layers to build "climate memory strata," allowing visitors to perceive century-long temperature fluctuations through walking.</p>
            <p>This shift is rooted in Timothy Morton’s theory of <span class="highlight">ecological entanglement</span>: nature is not an "external landscape" but a non-human actor sharing time, matter, and fate with humans. Gardens thus become "<strong>temporal infrastructures</strong>," anchoring "slow rhythms" against Stiegler’s "temporal poverty caused by technological acceleration." Crucially, they reconstruct the <strong>intergenerational contract</strong> between humans and nature through <span class="highlight">material archives</span>—each ring a promise to the future.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>II. Bodily Dimension: Perceptual Correction and Embodied Resistance</h2>
            <p>In algorithmic societies, human perception is what Habermas calls the <strong>colonization of the lifeworld</strong>—technological systems datafy, visualize, and fragment perception, replacing lived experience with the "attention economy." Gardens become <span class="highlight">cognitive antidotes</span>, rebuilding contemplative capacity through embodied spatial design.</p>
            <p>Japan’s "Garden of Wind" activates auditory and tactile senses through wind chimes, airflow paths, and textured paving, breaking the visual monopoly; Berlin’s "Sensory Maze" uses scent trails (pine resin, soil, humus) and temperature gradients to restore multisensory memory, awakening the algorithmically suppressed "<strong>environmental body</strong>." This practice resonates with Merleau-Ponty’s <em>phenomenology of the body</em>: perception is the <em>co-constitution</em> of body and world, not passive reception. Gardens do not offer "information" but <span class="highlight">perceptual interstices</span>, allowing the body to rebuild a "non-instrumental relationship" with the environment during slow movement—a <span class="highlight">pre-reflective co-presence</span>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>III. Social Dimension: Underground Diplomacy and Microbial Mediation</h2>
            <p>While traditional gardens serve as "cultural symbols," contemporary gardens become media for <span class="highlight">soil diplomacy</span>. Anna Tsing’s theory of "multispecies survival" reveals how fungal hyphae, rhizobia, and other microbes build "ecological communication networks" beneath the soil, crossing borders and species. Examples include the China-Mongolia "Grassland Mycelium Corridor," which activates mycorrhizal networks via leguminous plants to enhance carbon sequestration; and the Israel-Palestine "Shared Olive Grove," where joint care of olive trees builds "ecological trust mechanisms" in conflict zones, enabling "<strong>non-verbal reconciliation</strong>."</p>
            <p>Gardens thus shift from "cultural signifiers" to <span class="highlight">underground diplomatic platforms</span>, establishing cross-border empathy through microbial "non-human mediation." This "microbial diplomacy" transcends anthropocentric governance, forming a "<strong>post-geopolitical governance model</strong>"—governance not through state treaties, but via <span class="highlight">chemical signals in soil</span> (e.g., volatile organic compounds) and <span class="highlight">rhizosphere dialogue</span>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Practical Pathways: Three Design Principles</h2>
            <p>To translate theory into actionable practice, this article proposes three design principles ensuring the <span class="highlight">replicability, equity, and decentralization</span> of posthuman gardens:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Multispecies Participatory Design</strong><br>
                    Invite botanists, microbiologists, indigenous communities, and citizens to co-design, using tools like "<span class="highlight">non-human agency assessment</span>" (e.g., root growth simulation, microbial community modeling) to ensure plants and microbes retain "design rights" not unilaterally determined by humans.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sensory Democratization</strong><br>
                    Use low-cost materials (tactile paving, scent installations, wind sculptures) to make "cognitive detox" spaces accessible, avoiding exclusivity to the middle class. Example: "Sound Gardens" made from recycled plastic, enabling low-income communities to experience multisensory healing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ecological Data Commons</strong><br>
                    Employ <span class="highlight">blockchain + DNA barcoding</span> to create open databases tracking soil microbial diversity and tree-ring carbon sequestration. Use <span class="highlight">smart contracts</span> to prevent corporate monopolization, ensuring data functions as an "<strong>ecological commons</strong>" for public research and governance.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Critical Reflection on Technological Mediation</strong>: While blockchain enhances transparency, it risks reducing ecological relations to "verifiable nodes"; DNA barcoding increases microbial visibility but may slide into "genetic colonization"—reducing life to sequences. Technology must serve <span class="highlight">decentralized visibility</span>, not <strong>re-centralized control</strong>.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Conclusion: The Non-Human Contract and the Ethics of Governance</h2>
            <p>The vision of the "posthuman garden" ultimately points to a <span class="highlight">non-human contract</span>: Are we willing to recognize that trees, microbes, and soil are not merely "resources," but "<strong>co-inhabitants</strong>"? This contract demands a <span class="highlight">theoretical clarification</span> of "non-human actors":</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Non-human actors</strong> are not anthropomorphized "conscious subjects." Their agency manifests through <span class="highlight">material practices</span>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mycorrhizal networks exchange nutrients and warnings via chemical signals;</li>
                        <li>Trees regulate local climate through transpiration;</li>
                        <li>Soil stores water and carbon via pore structures.</li>
                    </ul>
                    These actions require no "intention" yet <strong>effectively participate in governance</strong>, forming "<span class="highlight">distributed agency</span>."
                </li>
                <li>Their agency arises from <span class="highlight">relational existence within networks</span>, as Latour notes: "An actor only becomes an actor within a network."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We must also remain alert to the <span class="highlight">duality of technological mediation</span>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Positive</strong>: <span class="highlight">DNA barcoding</span> makes microbes "traceable"; <span class="highlight">biofeedback systems</span> allow plants to "express" health;</li>
                <li><strong>Risk</strong>: Technology may enable the <span class="highlight">datafied colonization</span> of non-humans, extracting them from ecological wholes and reducing them to governance tools.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>True governance must use technology to serve <span class="highlight">decentralization</span>, not <strong>re-centralization</strong>. Gardens should ultimately become experimental sites for <span class="highlight">non-human empowerment</span>. Here, wind speaks, soil remembers, microbes engage in diplomacy—and humans are merely one among many actors. Only then can gardens evolve from "vessels of beauty" into "<span class="highlight">sites of ecological contract-writing</span>"—at the intersection of time, body, and society—redefining what it means to "co-exist," and what "the future" might be.</p>
