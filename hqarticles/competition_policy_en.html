            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the context of rapid global economic and social development, digital platforms, green transformation, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have become important forces driving economic growth and social progress. However, the development in these areas also brings new challenges, especially in market competition. How to find a balance between promoting innovation, maintaining fair market competition, and achieving sustainable development is a significant issue for policymakers today. This article will explore the multi-dimensional perspectives of competition policy from the angles of digital platforms, green transformation, and SMEs, as well as their future regulatory paths.</p>

            <h2>I. Characteristics of Digital Platforms and Competition Policy</h2>
            <h3>1. Characteristics of Digital Platforms</h3>
            <p>Digital platforms typically have the following characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Network Effects:</strong> An increase in the number of users enhances the value of the platform, attracting more users and creating a positive feedback loop.</li>
                <li><strong>Data-Driven:</strong> Digital platforms collect and analyze large amounts of user data to optimize services and improve user experience, which can also lead to data barriers.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Industry Integration:</strong> Digital platforms often span multiple industries, providing comprehensive services such as e-commerce, payments, and logistics, blurring traditional industry boundaries.</li>
                <li><strong>Rapid Innovation:</strong> The rapid development of digital technology enables platforms to quickly launch new products and services, but it can also lead to rapid changes in market dynamics.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Current Status of Competition Policy</h3>
            <p>Currently, competition policies for digital platforms in various countries mainly focus on the following areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Antitrust Regulation:</strong> Investigating and penalizing monopolistic behaviors of digital platforms, such as the abuse of dominant market positions, exclusion, or restriction of competition. For example, the EU's multiple antitrust investigations and fines against Google.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> Protecting user data privacy through legislation to prevent platforms from misusing user data. For example, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</li>
                <li><strong>Market Access:</strong> Supporting new entrants by lowering market entry barriers and promoting market competition. For example, encouraging innovative enterprises through tax incentives and financial support.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency Requirements:</strong> Requiring platforms to disclose algorithms, data usage rules, and other information to increase market transparency and protect consumer rights.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Future Regulatory Paths</h3>
            <p>To achieve a dynamic balance between digital platforms and competition policy, future regulatory paths should consider the following aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flexible Regulatory Framework:</strong> Establishing a flexible and adaptable regulatory framework to address the rapidly changing market environment of digital platforms. Regulatory policies should have foresight and be able to adjust in a timely manner to address new challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Inter-Agency Collaboration:</strong> The cross-industry nature of digital platforms requires enhanced cooperation among regulatory agencies to form a multi-agency collaborative regulatory mechanism. For example, antitrust agencies, data protection agencies, and consumer protection agencies should establish information sharing and coordination mechanisms.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting Innovation and Fairness:</strong> Encouraging innovation while ensuring fair market competition. This can be achieved by setting up innovation funds, providing technical training, and other support for SMEs and startups, while also strengthening the regulation of large platforms to prevent...</li>
            </ul>
