            <h3>Technological Foundations and Applications</h3>
            <h4>1. Emotion Recognition Technology:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> and <strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong> are the foundations of emotion recognition. Intelligent customer service systems analyze users' text or voice inputs to identify their emotional state, such as anger, satisfaction, frustration, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time Emotion Monitoring</strong> and <strong>Emotion Guidance</strong> allow the system to adjust service strategies in real-time based on changes in user emotions, providing comforting language or positive responses.</li>
                <li>The ability to <strong>Understand Context</strong> enables the system to capture subtle emotional changes during conversations, providing more humanized service.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>2. Big Data Analysis and Personalized Service:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Big data analysis enables intelligent customer service systems to deeply mine user behavior data, predict user needs, and provide personalized recommendations.</li>
                <li>By analyzing data from user interactions, purchase behaviors, etc., the system can preemptively resolve issues or recommend products, enhancing service efficiency and user satisfaction.</li>
                <li>However, this use of data also brings challenges in <strong>Privacy Protection</strong> and <strong>Data Security</strong>, necessitating companies to enhance data protection measures.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>3. Cross-Platform and Multimodal Interaction:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Users can seamlessly access services across multiple platforms such as mobile devices, smart homes, and social media.</li>
                <li><strong>Multimodal Interaction</strong> includes various methods like voice, text, images, and video, offering a richer interactive experience.</li>
                <li>Achieving this interaction requires addressing technical challenges like <strong>Semantic Understanding</strong>, <strong>Multimodal Data Fusion</strong>, and <strong>Real-time Processing</strong>, while ensuring the security of user data.</li>
            </ul>
