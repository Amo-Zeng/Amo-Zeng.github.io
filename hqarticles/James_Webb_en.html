            <h2>Max Weber's Legacy of Modernity: Individual and Social Relations in a Global Perspective</h2>
            <p>Max Weber, one of the most influential sociologists of the early 20th century, not only had a profound impact on the academic world but also sparked extensive thinking and discussion in modern society. Weber's theories, particularly his analysis of modernity, deeply reflect the contemporary quest for meaning, rationality, and freedom. By exploring concepts such as Weber's "Disenchantment of the World" and the "Iron Cage of Rationality," we can better understand the anxieties and challenges of modern society and how to find individual and social meaning and freedom within this context.</p>

            <h3>Disenchantment of the World and Modernity Anxiety</h3>
            <p>Weber's concept of "Disenchantment of the World" describes how the dominance of science and rationality in modern society has gradually replaced the influence of traditional religion and mysticism. In pre-modern societies, religion and mysticism provided a transcendent framework of meaning, allowing individuals to find spiritual solace and guidance in the face of uncertainty and suffering. However, with the development of science and rationality, this mystique has diminished, and the world has become increasingly "rationalized" and "calculable."</p>
            <p>This characteristic of modernity brings profound anxiety. Weber argues that individuals in modern society can no longer rely on traditional religion and mysticism to find life's meaning and purpose. Instead, they must navigate a highly rationalized and scientific world through their own rational thinking and actions. This transition places immense pressure and uncertainty on individuals, who must not only cope with various challenges in daily life but also find their place and direction in a world devoid of transcendent meaning.</p>

            <h3>Iron Cage of Rationality and the Paradox of Individual Freedom</h3>
            <p>Weber's concept of the "Iron Cage of Rationality" further reveals another significant source of anxiety in modernity. Weber points out that the process of rationalization in modern society not only affects the operation of economic, political, and social institutions but also profoundly alters individuals' lifestyles and behavior patterns. Rationalization means that efficiency, calculation, and control become the core principles of social operation, and individuals' behaviors and choices are increasingly constrained and regulated by the rationalized system.</p>
            <p>In this context, individual freedom and autonomy face significant challenges. While rationalization brings efficiency and control, it also makes life increasingly mechanical and standardized. Weber believes that the rationalization process in modern society traps individuals in an "iron cage," where their behaviors and choices are restricted by strict rational rules and systems, losing freedom and creativity. This "cage" is not only reflected in career and lifestyle choices but also penetrates individuals' way of thinking and value systems, making it difficult for them to break free from rationalization and find true freedom and autonomy.</p>

            <h3>Strategies for Coping with Modernity Anxiety</h3>
            <p>In response to the anxiety and challenges brought by modernity, Weber's theories provide some coping strategies. Firstly, Weber emphasizes the distinction between value rationality (Wertrationalität) and instrumental rationality (Zweckrationalität). Value rationality emphasizes actions based on intrinsic beliefs, values, and moral principles, while instrumental rationality aims at maximizing efficiency and results. Weber argues that in a rationalized modern society, individuals need to find a balance between value rationality and instrumental rationality to maintain efficiency and control while preserving individual freedom and creativity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Weber's study of the "Protestant Ethic" reveals the profound impact of individual values and behavior patterns on social structures and economic systems. By examining how the Protestant Ethic contributed to the formation of modern capitalism, Weber demonstrates the significant role of individuals in social change. This study highlights that individuals still possess agency and creativity in the face of rationalization and mechanization challenges, capable of influencing social structures and systems through their actions and choices.</p>
            <p>Finally, Weber's theories also remind us that in modern society, individuals need to continuously reflect on and question existing rationalized systems and institutions, seeking meaning and value beyond rationalization. Through critical thinking and creative actions, individuals can find spaces for freedom and autonomy within the rationalized "iron cage," redefining their life meaning and goals.</p>

            <h3>Global Dissemination and Cross-Cultural Application of Weber's Thought</h3>
            <p>The global dissemination of Weber's thought is firstly attributed to the universality and applicability of his theories. Weber's studies on religious sociology, economic history, and political sociology reveal complex relationships between social structures and individual behaviors, making these theoretical frameworks and methodologies highly explanatory and applicable in different cultural and social contexts.</p>
            <p>In Western sociology, Weber's thought has profoundly influenced research since the 20th century. As one of the "classical trio of sociology," alongside Marx and Durkheim, Weber forms the theoretical foundation of modern sociology. His theories on rationalization, bureaucratization, and power sociology provide important analytical tools for understanding the complexity and dynamics of modern society.</p>
            <p>However, Weber's influence is not limited to Western sociology. With the acceleration of globalization, Weber's thought has gradually spread and been applied across the world. Scholars from different cultural backgrounds have interpreted and applied Weber's theories, forming diverse sociological theoretical schools and enriching the global sociological theoretical resources and analytical perspectives.</p>

            <h3>Application of Weber's Thought in Latin America</h3>
            <p>In Latin America, Weber's religious sociology and political sociology have been widely applied. Latin American sociologists have used Weber's religious sociology to critique the impact of capitalism and colonialism and explore the relationship between religious beliefs and social change. For example, scholars in the Liberation Theology movement have used Weber's religious sociology to analyze the role of the Catholic Church in Latin American social change, revealing how religious beliefs can play a significant role in social movements and political transformations.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Latin American scholars have also applied Weber's political sociology to explore power structures and governance issues. Weber's theories on bureaucracy and power provide insights into understanding the political systems and governance of Latin American countries.</p>
