            <h3>I. New Forms of Class Struggle in the Context of Globalization</h3>
            <p>Globalization has driven the cross-border flow of capital, technology, and information at an unprecedented speed and scale, profoundly reshaping class structures and forms of struggle. Traditional class divisions based on regions and industries have gradually blurred, giving way to more complex and diverse global class structures.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transnational Capitalist Class</strong>: This class holds the core power of global capital flows, dominates transnational industrial chains and value distribution, and reaps excess profits.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Working Class</strong>: Low-skilled workers scattered across countries, facing persistent threats of unemployment, poverty, and social exclusion.</li>
                <li><strong>Emerging Middle Class</strong>: Benefiting from globalization, but still bearing the dual pressures of job insecurity and rising living costs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the context of globalization, the forms of class struggle are more diverse and covert, such as monopolies and exploitation by multinational corporations, the rise of the digital platform economy, and environmental justice movements. Moreover, the spatial scope of class struggle has transcended national boundaries, showing new trends of internationalization and networking.</p>

In the new era, class struggle continues to exist within certain limits and may intensify in some areas. Socialism with Chinese characteristics emphasizes the principal position of the people and promotes common prosperity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Marxist Class Analysis Method</strong>: Scientifically analyze new changes in class conditions and accurately grasp new characteristics of class struggle.</li>
                <li><strong>Party Leadership</strong>: Uphold and strengthen the Party's comprehensive leadership to ensure its central role in national governance.</li>
                <li><strong>People's Democratic Dictatorship</strong>: Uphold the principal position of the people and legally prevent and combat actions that endanger national security.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>III. New Manifestations of Class Struggle in the Digital Economy Era</h3>
            <p>In the digital economy era, new generations of information technology represented by the internet, big data, and artificial intelligence have profoundly changed production methods and social structures, bringing new manifestations of class struggle.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital Capitalist Class</strong>: Control digital technologies and platform resources, dominate data flow, information flow, and capital flow, and reap enormous profits.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Working Class</strong>: Engage in digital and networked production and services, facing issues of job insecurity and widening income gaps.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Middle Class</strong>: Benefiting from the digital economy but also facing challenges of career transition and skills updating.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>New manifestations of class struggle in the digital economy era include labor-capital contradictions in platform economies, data monopolies and privacy protection, algorithmic discrimination and social fairness, and the digital divide and social stratification. Strategies to address these issues include strengthening labor protection in the digital era, breaking data monopolies, promoting algorithmic fairness, and bridging the digital divide.</p>
