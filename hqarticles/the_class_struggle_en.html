            <h2>Class Struggle and the Multifaceted Development of Chinese Society</h2>
            <p>Class struggle, as the essence of Marxism, is deeply imprinted in every historical phase of Chinese social change. Through multidimensional perspectives—historical, economic, and social—we gain insight into the dual roles and profound impacts of class struggle in driving social transformation, economic progress, and social justice.</p>

            <h3>Historical Perspective: Class Struggle and Social Change</h3>
            <p>Since its establishment, the Communist Party of China has regarded class struggle as the engine of social change. During the New Democratic Revolution, the Party led the working and peasant classes in fierce battles against the landlords and bourgeoisie, successfully overthrowing the shackles of feudalism and imperialism, and winning national independence and the people's liberation. This period's class struggle was not only a profound transformation of social structures but also laid a solid foundation for the blueprint of socialism.</p>
            <p>In the period of socialist construction, the forms and focuses of class struggle shifted. Land reforms and cooperative movements eliminated the landlord class, while the policy of public-private partnership restructured urban industry and commerce, gradually building an economic system dominated by public ownership. However, the expansion of class struggle during the Cultural Revolution led to serious social chaos and a decline in productivity.</p>
            <p>After the reform and opening-up, the main contradiction in Chinese society became the growing needs of the people for a better life versus the unbalanced and inadequate development. Although class struggle is no longer dominant, its analytical framework remains crucial for addressing social issues. In this new era, class struggle is more reflected in the distribution of economic interests and the pursuit of social justice, requiring balance through laws and policies to mediate the interests of different social groups.</p>

            <h3>Economic Perspective: Class Struggle and Economic Construction</h3>
            <p>Class struggle has played a dual role in China's economic construction: it has both driven the innovation of the economic system and the development of productivity, and brought challenges and dilemmas to economic development.</p>
            <p>After the victory of the New Democratic Revolution, land reforms and cooperative movements eliminated the feudal landlord class, greatly stimulating the production enthusiasm of farmers and providing necessary agricultural support for industrialization. The policy of public-private partnership in cities realized the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, establishing the dominant position of state-owned economy.</p>
            <p>However, class struggle also caused many problems in economic construction. During the Cultural Revolution, the expansion of class struggle led to chaos in production order and a decline in economic efficiency, seriously hindering economic development.</p>
            <p>Since the reform and opening-up, China has shifted to market-oriented economic reforms, gradually relaxing restrictions on private economies and introducing market competition mechanisms. This transformation has, to some extent, alleviated the negative impact of class struggle on economic development, promoting the liberation of productivity and rapid economic growth. However, with economic development, new class divisions and social inequalities have gradually emerged.</p>
            <p>In the current phase, class struggle is more reflected in the distribution of economic interests. With the widening gap between the rich and the poor, conflicts of interest among different social groups have become increasingly evident. How to ensure sustained economic growth while achieving social fairness and justice has become an important issue facing China's economic construction.</p>

            <h3>Social Perspective: Class Struggle and Social Equity</h3>
            <p>Class struggle has had a profound impact on social equity in the development of Chinese society. During the New Democratic Revolution, land reforms and cooperative movements eliminated the feudal landlord class, achieving the liberation of farmers and promoting social equity to some extent. However, in the subsequent process of socialist construction, the expansion of class struggle led to social instability and the lack of fairness and justice.</p>
            <p>Since the reform and opening-up, China's economy has achieved tremendous development, but it has also been accompanied by the widening gap between the rich and the poor and the intensification of social inequality. Class struggle in this new era is more reflected in the distribution of economic interests and the occupation of social resources. How to achieve social equity and justice has become an important issue facing Chinese society.</p>
            <p>To address these challenges, it is necessary to strengthen legal and policy measures to ensure that the fruits of economic development are shared more equitably, and to promote social harmony and justice.</p>
