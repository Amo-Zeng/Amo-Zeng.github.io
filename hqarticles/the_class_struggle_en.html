            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Under the dual drivers of globalization and digital technology, social and economic structures, as well as value systems, are undergoing profound transformations. These changes not only affect people's lifestyles but also redefine the forms and meanings of class struggle. Traditionally, class struggle revolved around the distribution of material wealth. However, today, the focus has shifted towards the pursuit of non-material values. The "algorithmic class struggle" in the digital age and the "transnational class struggle" in globalization have further complicated this transformation. This article will explore the new paradigms of class struggle in the context of globalization and the digital age, starting from the transition from "ownership" to "experience," and look ahead to future paths of struggle.</p>

            <h2>I. From Materialism to Post-Materialism: The Transformation of Class Struggle's Value System</h2>
            <p>In the age of materialism, the core of class struggle was the possession and distribution of material wealth. The working class fought for higher wages and better working conditions through unions and strikes, while the bourgeoisie consolidated their economic positions through technological innovation and market expansion. However, with economic development and social progress, basic material needs were gradually met, and people began to seek higher-level spiritual pursuits such as personal growth, environmental protection, and social justice.</p>
            <p>The advent of the post-materialist era signifies a profound shift in social values. People no longer rely solely on material wealth to achieve self-worth but tend to gain fulfillment through experiences and emotional satisfaction. This shift has not only changed consumption patterns but also reshaped the form of class struggle. The focus of struggle has moved from the distribution of material wealth to the realization of non-material values, such as better working environments, more flexible working hours, and more opportunities for career development. The means of struggle have also become more diverse, including social media activities, environmental movements, and social justice movements.</p>

            <h2>II. The "Algorithmic Class Struggle" in the Digital Age: From "Humans Being Exploited" to "Machines Being Exploited"</h2>
            <p>In the digital age, algorithms have become the core mechanism of social operations, profoundly affecting the form of class struggle. In the early stages, algorithms were primarily tools for capital to optimize exploitation efficiency and exacerbate social inequality. Capital used algorithms to collect and analyze massive amounts of data, accurately identify user needs, and implement personalized recommendations to maximize user value. During this process, algorithms became tools to exploit workers, intensifying social inequality.</p>
            <p>However, with the development of artificial intelligence technology, the value of algorithms themselves has become increasingly prominent and, gradually, they have become objects of exploitation. Algorithms have been commodified, sold as paid services; alienated, as tools for profit maximization; and even become a new "working class" facing exploitation. The development and maintenance of algorithms require significant resources, yet the value they create is seized by capital. Algorithm developers have become a new "working class," working for capital but unable to share in the benefits brought by algorithms.</p>
            <p>"Algorithmic class struggle" reflects new changes in the social structure of the digital age. From "humans being exploited" to "machines being exploited" symbolizes the transformation of algorithms from tools to subjects. In the future, building a human-centric algorithmic society, exploring algorithm profit-sharing mechanisms, and focusing on algorithmic ethics will be important directions for addressing "algorithmic class struggle."</p>

            <h2>III. The "Transnational Class Struggle" of Globalization: From Regional Conflicts to Global Confrontations</h2>
            <p>While globalization drives economic prosperity and cultural exchange, it also becomes a new arena for class struggle. Traditional class conflicts were often confined to specific geographical spaces, but under globalization, class contradictions have evolved into "global confrontations." Transnational capital, through global production networks and financial systems, redefines class relations. The struggle goals of the working class are no longer limited to a single enterprise or country but extend to the entire global production system.</p>
            <p>The core driving force of globalization is transnational capital, which further enhances its power through low-cost, high-efficiency global resource allocation. However, the global working class is marginalized by capital's global mobility. Workers in developed countries face de-industrialization and unemployment, while workers in developing countries are trapped in low wages and high-intensity labor. Globalization has not led to equal distribution of benefits but has instead exacerbated global wealth disparities.</p>
            <p>A sign of global confrontation is the union of the global working class. The establishment and development of international labor organizations enable workers from different countries to collectively confront transnational capital. Additionally, global social movements, such as the "Occupy Wall Street" movement, also mark the globalization of class struggle. This movement was not only a protest against the wealth gap in the United States but also a critique of the global capitalist system.</p>

            <h2>IV. Future Prospects for the New Paradigm of Class Struggle</h2>
            <p>Class struggle in the context of globalization and the digital age is transitioning from materialist "ownership" to post-materialist "experience," from "humans being exploited" to "machines being exploited," and from regional conflicts to global confrontations. This shift is not only a transformation in the form of struggle but also a reorganization of class relations.</p>
            <p>In the future, class struggle will face more complex challenges. The working class will not only need to confront the oppression of global capital but also explore new forms of struggle, such as achieving better working conditions through international labor standards or leveraging digital technology and social media for global united actions. Meanwhile, building a human-centric algorithmic society, exploring algorithm profit-sharing mechanisms, and focusing on algorithmic ethics will also be important directions for addressing class struggle in the digital age.</p>
            <p>The transnational class struggle under globalization is still in its infancy but holds immense potential. Globalization has concentrated capital's power to an unprecedented extent, but it has also made the working class's struggle more global. Through united actions, the working class can weaken capital's power on a global scale and promote true social justice and equality.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The transition from "ownership" to "experience" is not only a profound transformation in social values but also the core characteristic of the new paradigm of class struggle. Against the backdrop of globalization and the digital age, the forms and meanings of class struggle are undergoing significant changes. The global working class must adapt to these changes, confront the oppression of global capital through transnational united actions, and explore new forms of struggle and mechanisms. Only in this way can true social justice and equality be achieved in the context of globalization.</p>
