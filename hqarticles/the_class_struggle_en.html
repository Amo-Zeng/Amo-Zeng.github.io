            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Class struggle is an important concept in sociology and political economy, first introduced by Marx and Engels in "The Communist Manifesto." Traditionally, class struggle was primarily manifested as the conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, with its historical context rooted in the formation and development of capitalist society following the Industrial Revolution. However, with the continuous progress of society and profound changes in economic structures, class struggle in modern society has taken on new characteristics and forms. Technological progress, globalization, and the rise of social movements have all had a profound impact on class struggle.</p>

            <h3>1. Worsening Economic Inequality</h3>
            <p>In modern society, the inequality in income and wealth distribution has become increasingly severe. According to data from the World Inequality Database, the wealthiest 1% of the global population owns more than 40% of the world's wealth, while the poorest 50% own less than 1%. This extreme inequality not only exacerbates social conflicts but also has a profound impact on social structures and class relations. The shrinking middle class and the widening gap between the rich and the poor threaten social stability and intensify class contradictions.</p>

            <h3>2. Changes in Labor-Capital Relations</h3>
            <p>In modern enterprises, labor-capital relations have undergone significant changes. The rise of the gig economy has led to an increasing number of workers becoming freelancers or temporary workers. While this flexible employment form provides more job opportunities, it also brings issues such as job instability and poor welfare benefits. The widespread adoption of remote work has further transformed traditional labor relations, making it easier for companies to find low-cost labor globally, while workers face greater employment competition. These changes pose new challenges to the protection of workers' rights.</p>

            <h3>3. Social Movements and Class Consciousness</h3>
            <p>In recent years, a series of social movements have emerged globally, such as "Occupy Wall Street" and the "Yellow Vest Movement." These movements not only reflect people's dissatisfaction with economic inequality and social injustice but also signify the awakening of class consciousness. In the "Occupy Wall Street" movement, protesters chanted "We are the 99%," clearly expressing their discontent with the 1% of the wealthy class. These social movements, through collective action and media dissemination, have enhanced people's class consciousness and promoted the process of social change.</p>

            <h3>4. Digital Divide and Information Inequality</h3>
            <p>The development of digital technology has brought convenience but has also exacerbated the inequality in information access. The widespread use of the internet and smartphones has made information dissemination faster, but there are significant differences in the use of digital technology across different social classes. The wealthy class can more easily access high-quality educational resources and information, while the poor face the challenge of the digital divide. This information inequality not only limits the development opportunities of the poor but also exacerbates social division. Therefore, narrowing the digital divide and improving the accessibility and fairness of information through policy and technological means is an urgent issue to be addressed.</p>

            <h3>5. The Impact of Technological Progress on Class Struggle</h3>
            <p>Technological progress is a key force driving social development. From the Industrial Revolution to the Information Age, each technological innovation has profoundly changed the social and economic structure. Technological progress not only improves production efficiency and promotes economic growth but also has a profound impact on social class relations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automation and Employment:</strong> The development of automation technology has significantly improved production efficiency but has also had a significant impact on the labor market. In particular, for low-skilled workers, the widespread adoption of automation technology has led to the disappearance of many traditional jobs. This change not only increases unemployment rates but also exacerbates income inequality, as the income of high-skilled workers and management remains stable or even grows, while the income and employment opportunities of low-skilled workers decrease significantly.</li>
                <li><strong>Information Asymmetry and Power Relations:</strong> The development of information technology has greatly changed the way information is disseminated and accessed, but it has also exacerbated the problem of information asymmetry. The information asymmetry between businesses and consumers gives businesses an advantageous position in the market, making it difficult for consumers to obtain sufficient information to make rational consumption decisions. The information asymmetry between the government and citizens is also becoming more serious. The government, through surveillance technology and big data analysis, can have a more comprehensive understanding of citizens' behaviors and preferences, while citizens find it difficult to obtain transparent information about government decisions. This information asymmetry not only affects citizens' privacy rights but can also lead to the abuse of government power, exacerbating social inequality.</li>
                <li><strong>Innovation and Capital Accumulation:</strong> Technological innovation is an important driver of economic growth, but it also accelerates the process of capital accumulation. Tech giants accumulate enormous wealth through technological innovation and market monopolies, while startups gain rapid development opportunities through venture capital and capital markets. This capital flow not only exacerbates wealth inequality but also affects the economic status of different social classes.</li>
                <li><strong>Education and Skill Enhancement:</strong> Technological progress has had a profound impact on the demand for education and skill training. With the development of automation and information technology, the demand for high-skilled talent in society is increasing, while the demand for low-skilled workers is gradually decreasing. This change requires the education system to undergo corresponding reforms to cultivate more high-skilled and innovative talents. Educational inequality is an important factor in exacerbating class division. The uneven distribution of high-quality educational resources leads to educational disparities between different social classes, affecting social mobility and the distribution of economic opportunities.</li>
