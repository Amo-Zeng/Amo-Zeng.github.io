            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The digital revolution of the 21st century has reshaped the global economy, social structures, and cultural forms at an unprecedented speed and scale. Not only has the technological wave transformed human lifestyles, but it has also exacerbated social inequalities. While digitalization promised equal access to information and technology, the digital divide has deepened class polarization in new forms. At the same time, the deepening of globalization has made class mobility issues more complicated, and the game of class and cultural hegemony presents new dynamics. This article will explore three core dimensions: class polarization in the digital age, class mobility from a global perspective, and the game of class and cultural hegemony, to discuss how technological revolution changes human destiny, analyze social inequality issues, and envision how to find a balance between technological progress and social justice.</p>

            <h2>1. Class Polarization in the Digital Age: Technological Empowerment and Social Inequality</h2>
            <p>The advent of the digital age, on the surface, has granted information and technology a universal convenience, but this technological empowerment is not evenly distributed. Groups that master core technologies, possess data resources, and have algorithmic advantages have rapidly risen to become the new elite class. They not only dominate economically but also occupy the commanding heights of social discourse and cultural influence. Internet giants, through platform economy models, control vast amounts of user data and market resources, using algorithm optimization and artificial intelligence technology to achieve precise market control and deep user influence. This technological monopoly enables them to obtain excess profits on a global scale, further consolidating their class position.</p>
            <p>However, in stark contrast to the rise of the new class is the worsening plight of the lower class. Digital transformation has led to massive layoffs in traditional industries, with low-skilled laborers being the first to be affected. The application of automation and artificial intelligence technologies has rendered many traditional jobs redundant, and these laborers often lack the ability and resources to transition, falling into a vicious cycle of unemployment and poverty. Moreover, the digital divide is particularly evident in public services such as education and healthcare. Those unable to access high-speed internet or use digital devices are at an absolute disadvantage in resource acquisition, further exacerbating social class solidification.</p>
            <p>Technological monopoly is not limited to the economic field; it permeates all aspects of social life. Internet platforms profoundly influence people's ideological concepts and value orientations through algorithmic recommendations and content distribution. Algorithmic discrimination is becoming increasingly prominent, with big data-based algorithmic recommendations often reinforcing social biases and discrimination, resulting in social inequality in more隐蔽 and profound ways. The普及 of digital surveillance also poses a severe threat to personal privacy and freedom. Governments and corporations, through big data and artificial intelligence technology, achieve precise monitoring of individual behavior, further exacerbating class polarization.</p>

            <h2>2. Class Mobility from a Global Perspective: Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
            <p>The acceleration of globalization has accelerated the cross-border flow of capital, technology, and information but has not brought the expected benefits of class mobility. Class solidification phenomena are becoming increasingly apparent globally, primarily reflected in the widening education gap, the "Matthew effect" in the labor market, and disparities in social security systems. High-quality education resources are increasingly concentrated among the high-income class, with educational inequality becoming a key factor hindering social mobility. Technological progress and the automation wave have reduced employment opportunities in traditional industries, with high-skilled, high-paying jobs often occupied by the elite class, further compressing the employment space of the vulnerable groups. Meanwhile, many developing countries' social security systems are still inadequate, with贫困人口 lacking necessary support and unable to escape the poverty trap.</p>
            <p>Despite numerous challenges, globalization also provides new opportunities for class mobility. The普及 of information technology offers equal opportunities for people of different classes to access information, with online education platforms, vocational skills training, and other emerging models providing possibilities for the vulnerable groups to enhance their abilities and achieve class跨越. The extension of the global industrial chain has created a large number of new employment opportunities, especially in developing countries, where low-skilled laborers can obtain income growth opportunities by participating in the global production network. Additionally, social innovation organizations and projects are flourishing globally,致力于 providing education, employment, and entrepreneurial support for the vulnerable groups, injecting new vitality into breaking class barriers and promoting social mobility.</p>

            <h2>3. The Game of Class and Cultural Hegemony: Power and Symbolic Struggle</h2>
            <p>In the complex structure of modern society, the game of class and cultural hegemony constitutes a profound issue. Class, as the core dimension of social stratification, determines resource allocation, power operation, and social status; cultural hegemony is an important tool for the ruling class to shape and consolidate its legitimacy through ideology, values, and belief systems. The two intertwine and jointly作用于 social structure reproduction and transformation.</p>
            <p>The realization of cultural hegemony relies on a complex set of social mechanisms. The education system is a crucial field of cultural hegemony reproduction, through curriculum setting, knowledge selection, and dissemination, the education system internalizes the ruling class's values, historical perspective, and worldview into the student population, shaping their social cognition and identity. The media and cultural industries also play important roles in the construction of cultural hegemony, selectively reporting and narrating to shape public cognitive frameworks and reinforce the legitimacy of the ruling class. However, the construction of cultural hegemony is not smooth sailing; the ruled class challenges the ruling class's symbolic order through resistant culture, subculture, and anti-hegemonic discourse.</p>
            <p>The game of class and cultural hegemony is a dynamic process. The ruling class attempts to maintain its rule through cultural hegemony, while the ruled class competes for discourse power and legitimacy through cultural resistance and anti-hegemonic discourse. The outcome of this game often depends on the strength comparison and social structure change of both sides. In contemporary times, with the rise of globalization and neoliberalism, the content and form of cultural hegemony have also changed. Multinational corporations, social media, and digital technology have become new carriers of cultural hegemony, and the arena of class博弈 has expanded from traditional factories and streets to cyberspace and virtual communities. Cultural hegemony is no longer solely controlled by a single class but presents characteristics of diversity and fragmentation. Different classes, ethnic groups, and gender groups compete for the right to define meaning and value on the cultural stage.</p>

            <h2>4. The Future Path: Technological Inclusion, Global Cooperation, and Cultural Resistance</h2>
            <p>Class polarization in the digital age, class mobility from a global perspective, and the game of class and cultural hegemony together constitute the complex landscape of contemporary society. Faced with this reality, we need to find a balance between technological progress and social justice, promoting technological inclusion and social fairness. First, governments should increase investment in education, improve the allocation of educational resources, provide more educational opportunities and resources for vulnerable groups, enhance the quality of education, and cultivate students' critical thinking and innovative abilities. Second, governments should take measures to narrow employment gaps between different groups, provide vocational training, create more employment opportunities suitable for弱势群体, and improve the employment service system. Additionally, a sound social security system should be established to provide basic living security and assistance for vulnerable groups, preventing them from falling into the poverty trap.</p>
            <p>In the context of globalization, countries should strengthen cooperation to jointly address the challenges of class mobility. For example, developed countries can provide technical assistance and financial support to developing countries to help them improve education, employment, and social security systems. At the same time, cultural resistance and the possibility of class liberation provide us with new perspectives. By redefining the meaning of culture and symbols, the ruled class can break the established discourse order and propose new social visions and value诉求. Postcolonial theory, feminism, environmentalism, and other social movements have, to varying degrees, deconstructed cultural hegemony and proposed new value诉求 and social visions.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Class polarization in the digital age, class mobility from a global perspective, and the game of class and cultural hegemony together shape the social landscape of the 21st century. The technological revolution brings unprecedented opportunities and challenges, globalization accelerates the flow of capital and information, and the dynamic game of cultural hegemony reveals new dimensions of class struggle. Faced with this complex social reality, we need to find a balance in technological inclusion, global cooperation, and cultural resistance, promoting social fairness and justice, and achieving sustainable development in the digital age. Only in this way can we create opportunities for everyone to realize their dreams and build a fairer, more inclusive society.</p>
