            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For a long time, humans have often adopted a "terminal governance" and "government-led" single model when addressing environmental pollution and social issues. However, as environmental issues become more complex and social needs more diverse, this traditional model is no longer sufficient to meet the demands of reality, necessitating a transition to a more systematic and pluralistic governance model. This article will explore the transition path from "single governance" to "pluralistic co-governance" by integrating the concepts of "ecosystem restoration," "pollutant collaborative governance," and "pluralistic co-governance," to achieve the synergistic evolution of ecological civilization construction and social governance.</p>

            <h2>I. The Dilemma and Limitations of the "Single Governance" Model</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Limitations of "Terminal Governance"</h3>
            <p>"Terminal governance" is a product of the industrial civilization, where the core idea is to treat nature as a resource base and a garbage dump, ignoring the integrity and complexity of ecosystems. Although this model temporarily alleviates pollution issues in the short term, it has limitations such as treating symptoms rather than the root cause, high costs, secondary pollution, and irreversible ecological damage. For example, the secondary pollution issues generated during the treatment of pollutants, and the difficulties in restoring damaged ecosystems, highlight the unsustainability of the "terminal governance" model.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Limitations of the "Government-Led" Model</h3>
            <p>In the field of social governance, the "government-led" model has long held a dominant position, but its issues of concentrated power, limited resources, and insufficient public participation are becoming increasingly apparent. For instance, governments may face "government failure" due to information asymmetry and decision-making errors when responding to emergencies; in meeting diverse public service needs, the limited resources of governments make it difficult to address every issue. Additionally, the limited channels for public participation can lead to the accumulation of social contradictions, affecting social stability.</p>
            <h3>1.3 Limitations of the "Single Pollutant Control" Model</h3>
            <p>In environmental governance, the traditional "single pollutant control" model often misses the big picture, making it difficult to achieve overall environmental quality improvement. For example, sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere can form acid rain, polluting water bodies and soil; nitrogen and phosphorus in water bodies can lead to eutrophication, further causing an increase in ozone concentration in the atmosphere. The single pollutant control model struggles to address these complex interactions and may even lead to new environmental problems.</p>

            <h2>II. The Connotation and Advantages of the "Pluralistic Co-Governance" Concept</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Systemic Thinking of "Ecosystem Restoration"</h3>
            <p>The "ecosystem restoration" concept emphasizes respect for natural laws and takes the integrity, complexity, and dynamic balance of ecosystems as the starting point for systemic and comprehensive governance measures. For example, through wetland restoration, forest reconstruction, and other means, the structure and function of ecosystems can be restored, achieving harmony between humans and nature. This model not only fundamentally addresses environmental issues but also offers advantages such as high cost-effectiveness and sustainable development.</p>
            <h3>2.2 Integrated Thinking of "Pollutant Collaborative Governance"</h3>
            <p>The "pollutant collaborative governance" concept emphasizes a full-chain governance model from source prevention, process control to terminal governance. For example, in air pollution control, desulfurization and denitrification technologies can be used to simultaneously reduce the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, thereby lowering heavy metal pollution in water bodies and soil. This model, through resource sharing and technological complementarity, effectively reduces governance costs and improves efficiency.</p>
            <h3>2.3 The New Paradigm of "Pluralistic Co-Governance" in Social Governance</h3>
            <p>The "pluralistic co-governance" model emphasizes the joint participation of multiple stakeholders such as the government, market, social organizations, and citizens in social governance. For instance, in community governance, the government can provide policy support, enterprises can offer funding and technology, social organizations can deliver services, and citizens can participate in decision-making and supervision. This model, through complementary advantages and resource sharing, can more effectively address complex social issues.</p>

            <h2>III. The Transition Path from "Single Governance" to "Pluralistic Co-Governance"</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Strengthening Top-Level Design to Build a Collaborative Governance System</h2>
            <p>Both ecological civilization construction and social governance require strengthening top-level design, formulating comprehensive policies and regulations, and clarifying goals, tasks, and responsibilities. For example, in ecological civilization construction, "ecosystem restoration" and "pollutant collaborative governance" can be incorporated into the national ecological security strategy; in social governance, a consultation mechanism with multiple stakeholders can be established to fully leverage the strengths of all parties.</p>
            <h3>3.2 Increasing Technological Investment to Enhance Governance Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Technological innovation is key to driving the transformation of governance models. In ecological civilization construction, enhancing the development of ecosystem restoration technologies and pollutant collaborative governance technologies is necessary, such as using biotechnology to repair damaged ecosystems and developing low-cost, high-efficiency desulfurization and denitrification technologies. In social governance, technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence can be used to build platforms for multiple stakeholders, improving governance efficiency.</p>
            <h3>3.3 Innovating Investment and Financing Mechanisms to Stimulate Market Vitality</h3>
            <p>Ecosystem restoration and social governance require significant capital investment, and the traditional government investment model is insufficient. Therefore, a diversified and market-oriented investment and financing mechanism needs to be established. For example, in the field of ecological restoration, social capital can be introduced through concession operations and government-private partnership (PPP) models to promote the implementation of ecological restoration projects. In social governance, public participation in public service projects can be encouraged, forming a co-governance and shared governance structure.</p>
            <h3>3.4 Strengthening Public Participation to Mobilize Governance Synergy</h3>
            <p>Public participation is the foundation for achieving "pluralistic co-governance." In ecological civilization construction, enhancing ecological civilization education is necessary to raise public ecological awareness and participation; in social governance, expanding public participation channels to ensure the public's right to know, participate, express, and supervise is crucial. For example, mechanisms such as community councils and environmental supervisors can be established to encourage public participation in environmental and social governance.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The transition from "single governance" to "pluralistic co-governance" is an inevitable choice for the synergistic evolution of ecological civilization and social governance. In the face of increasingly complex environmental issues and social demands, we need to break away from traditional thinking models and promote the transformation of governance models with systemic thinking and holistic perspectives. By strengthening top-level design, increasing technological investment, innovating investment and financing mechanisms, and enhancing public participation, we can build a collaborative governance system of "pluralistic co-governance," providing a strong guarantee for building a beautiful homeland where humans and nature coexist in harmony and realizing the Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.</p>
