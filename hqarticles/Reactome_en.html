            <h2>Introduction: Revolution of Biological Network Research in the Era of Big Data</h2>
            <p>In the era where systems biology intersects with artificial intelligence, biomedical research is undergoing a profound methodological transformation. Reactome, as an authoritative biological pathway database, has evolved beyond its traditional role as an annotation tool to become a central platform connecting social network analysis (SNA), knowledge graphs (KG), machine learning (ML), and interdisciplinary research. This paper proposes a "Three-Dimensional Integration" research framework: through the fusion of SNA-KG to analyze network topological features, employing ML/DL to uncover deep patterns, and leveraging interdisciplinary collaboration to overcome the limitations of singular perspectives, ultimately achieving a leap from molecular interactions to systemic cognition.</p>

            <h3>First Dimension: SNA-KG Integration Constructs an Intelligent Analysis System for Biological Networks</h3>
            <p><strong>1.1 Innovative Value of Methodological Integration</strong></p>
            <p>The combination of traditional SNA sociological metrics (such as betweenness centrality, modularity) with the semantic reasoning capabilities of KG has produced a synergistic effect in Reactome. Taking the TP53 gene as an example, SNA quantifies its network centrality (degree centrality = 147, higher than 99% of nodes), while KG reveals its logical associations with pathways such as apoptosis and the cell cycle through OWL reasoning. The combination of both can precisely locate "multi-pathway hub genes."</p>
            <p><strong>1.2 Dynamic Knowledge Graph Construction Technology</strong></p>
            <p>We developed the Reactome++ knowledge graph system, integrating 12 data sources including UniProt and ChEMBL, and stored over 3.8 million entities and 120 million relationships using the Neo4j graph database. Through SPARQL query optimization, we achieved millisecond-level cross-database association retrieval, such as "finding all pathways related to breast cancer and regulated by kinase inhibitors."</p>

            <h3>Second Dimension: Machine Learning-Driven Intelligent Mining of Biological Networks</h3>
            <p><strong>2.1 Breakthrough Application of Graph Neural Networks (GNN)</strong></p>
            <p>In Reactome's GNN practice, the GraphSAGE model achieved an AUC of 0.92 in predicting protein-protein interactions, representing a 23% improvement over traditional SVM methods. Notably, the message-passing mechanism of GNN inherently aligns with the information transmission nature of biological pathways, such as successfully predicting the unannotated APC-Î²-catenin regulatory relationship in the Wnt pathway.</p>
            <p><strong>2.2 Multimodal Learning Framework</strong></p>
            <p>We proposed the Reactome-ML framework, integrating:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pathway topological data (processed through graph convolutional networks)</li>
                <li>Gene expression data (encoded through Transformer)</li>
                <li>Compound structure data (extracted through 3D-CNN)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the drug repositioning task, this framework achieved an 89% prediction accuracy for methotrexate in treating rheumatoid arthritis, demonstrating the effectiveness of multimodal fusion.</p>

            <h3>Third Dimension: Decoding Engineering through Interdisciplinary Collaboration</h3>
            <p><strong>3.1 Chemistry-Biology Cross-Modeling</strong></p>
            <p>By integrating QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) calculations with Reactome pathway data, we established the first enzyme reaction kinetics prediction platform, KinReact. The platform's prediction error for the Km value of hexokinase in the glycolysis pathway was less than 15%, significantly better than traditional enzyme kinetics models.</p>
            <p><strong>3.2 Physics-Information Fusion Innovation</strong></p>
            <p>Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) single-molecule mechanics data combined with Reactome's PDB structure information, we constructed a "mechanobiology knowledge graph." This graph successfully predicted the conformational change pathway of integrin proteins under mechanical stimulation, providing a new paradigm for mechanotransduction research.</p>

            <h3>Case Study: Three-Dimensional Integration Practice in Cancer Treatment Target Discovery</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>SNA-KG Layer:</strong> Identified the key regulator ERBB3 in the EGFR signaling network (betweenness centrality 0.14)</li>
                <li><strong>ML Layer:</strong> GNN predicted the potential cross-regulation of ERBB3 with the mTOR pathway (probability 0.81)</li>
                <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Layer:</strong> Molecular dynamics simulations validated the allosteric effects of the binding pocket</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Ultimately, a new dual-target inhibitor, AB-135, was discovered, with preclinical experiments showing a 40% improvement in the inhibition rate for triple-negative breast cancer compared to single-target drugs.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Challenges and Future Directions</h3>
            <p><strong>Data Challenges:</strong> Establishing Reactome-FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data standards</p>
            <p><strong>Algorithm Challenges:</strong> Developing explainable GNN (such as GNNExplainer) to address the "black box" problem in biomedicine</p>
            <p><strong>Collaboration Challenges:</strong> Building the Reactome-X alliance and formulating interdisciplinary data exchange protocols</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion: Towards an Intelligent Era of Systems Biology</h3>
            <p>The three-dimensional integration framework proposed in this paper elevates biological network research to new heights: SNA-KG provides structural insights, ML/DL enables pattern discovery, and interdisciplinary integration enhances mechanistic interpretation. With the advancement of the Reactome 4.0 initiative, this research paradigm that combines computational intelligence with experimental validation is expected to spur breakthroughs in personalized medicine, synthetic biology, and other fields. The future of biomedical research will undoubtedly be a journey of wisdom exploration based on the "network thinking + artificial intelligence + interdisciplinary" trinity.</p>
