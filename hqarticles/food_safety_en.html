            <h2>Introduction: Safety on the Tip of the Tongue, Matters to All of Us</h2>
            <p>Food safety, as the foundation of people's livelihood, has always been a concern for every household and citizen. In recent years, from gutter oil, clenbuterol to plasticizers and pesticide residues, a series of food safety incidents have continuously tested the public's trust limits, exposing the various flaws of the traditional regulatory model. The traditional "reactive defense" model, mainly relying on government department inspections and penalties, suffers from issues such as delayed information acquisition and insufficient regulatory resources, making it difficult to cope with the increasingly complex food safety situation.</p>
            <p>Facing this challenge, we urgently need to change our mindset, shifting from "reactive defense" to "proactive action," and building a food safety social governance framework led by the government, self-disciplined enterprises, collaborative society, and public participation. Meanwhile, technological advancements, especially the integration of blockchain and IoT, are bringing unprecedented transparency and trust mechanisms to food safety. As Generation Z gradually becomes the main consumer force, their pursuit of food safety, health, and personalization is also leading new trends in the food industry.</p>

            <h2>I. From Reactive Defense to Proactive Action: Building a People-Participated Food Safety Governance System</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Government Leadership: Strengthening Regulatory Responsibilities and Enhancing Effectiveness</h3>
            <p>The government, as the main body of food safety regulation, must fulfill its regulatory responsibilities, improve the legal and regulatory system, innovate regulatory methods, and enhance regulatory effectiveness. By applying big data and AI technologies, a food safety traceability system can be established to achieve real-time monitoring of the entire food production, circulation, and consumption chain. Additionally, strengthening departmental collaboration, breaking down information barriers, and forming a regulatory synergy are essential.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Corporate Self-Discipline: Fulfilling Main Responsibilities and Strictly Controlling Quality</h3>
            <p>Enterprises are the first responsibility holders for food safety. They need to establish and improve food safety management systems, strictly controlling every link from raw material procurement, production processing to product transportation to ensure food safety is controllable. Through technological innovation and equipment upgrades, they can reduce food safety risks and enhance product safety.</p>
            <h3>1.3 Social Collaboration: Building a Governance Platform and Forming Regulatory Synergy</h3>
            <p>Food safety regulation requires the joint participation of multiple forces. By establishing a food safety information disclosure platform, opening up complaint and reporting channels, and encouraging public participation in supervision, a good atmosphere of society-wide food safety maintenance can be formed. Additionally, integrating resources from industry associations, media, and experts, a synergy for food safety governance can be achieved.</p>
            <h3>1.4 Public Participation: Enhancing Safety Awareness and Becoming Supervisors</h3>
            <p>The public is the ultimate beneficiary of food safety and an important supervisory force. Through diverse publicity and education activities, food safety knowledge can be popularized, improving the public's identification abilities and participation awareness. Advocating rational consumption, rejecting unidentified food sources, and encouraging the public to actively report illegal activities can form a network of public participation in food safety supervision.</p>

            <h2>II. Technological Innovation: Blockchain and IoT Building Transparent Trust Chains</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Blockchain: Creating an Immutable Trust Foundation</h3>
            <p>Blockchain technology, with its decentralized, immutable, and traceable features, provides an ideal solution for food traceability. Each batch of agricultural products is assigned a unique blockchain identifier during production, processing, transportation, and sales, recording key information such as origin, production date, and inspection reports. Once these data are on the chain, they cannot be tampered with, providing consumers with reliable trust endorsements.</p>
            <h3>2.2 IoT: Real-Time Data Collection Ensuring Information Authenticity</h3>
            <p>IoT technology collects data in real-time on agricultural product growth environments, processing, and transportation conditions through sensors, RFID, and other devices, uploading these data to the blockchain to ensure accuracy and real-time updates. Consumers can easily access this information by scanning a QR code on the product or using an app to understand the "past and present" of the food.</p>

            <h3>3.1 Transparent Kitchens and Sunny Farms</h3>
            <p>The traceability system built by blockchain and IoT technologies is triggering a transparency revolution in the food supply chain. Restaurant kitchens are no longer mysterious; consumers can watch the food processing process in real-time through live streaming platforms, making food safety "visible." Meanwhile, consumers can visit farms online, understanding the growth environments and planting methods of crops, exposing food origins to the "sun."</p>
            <h3>3.2 Consumer Proactive Information Acquisition</h3>
            <p>This transparency revolution breaks down the information barriers of traditional supply chains, enabling consumers to shift from passively receiving information to proactively acquiring it. Consumers can understand the entire process of food production through various channels, rebuilding their confidence in food safety.</p>
