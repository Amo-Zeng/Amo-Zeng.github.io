            <p>Blockchain technology, with its unique characteristics of decentralization, tamper-proof, and transparent traceability, provides a new way to solve food safety issues. Blockchain, through distributed ledger technology, records every link of food from production to consumption on the chain, allowing all participants to view and verify data in real time, ensuring information transparency and credibility. This technology not only solves the data tampering problem in traditional traceability systems but also eliminates reliance on centralized institutions, building a fairer and more trusted trust mechanism.</p>
            <h4>1.3 Blockchain Empowers Food Traceability: A Journey of Trust from Farm to Table</h4>
            <p>The application of blockchain technology in food traceability reshapes the journey of trust from farm to table. Through blockchain technology, small farmers can directly connect with consumers, reducing intermediate links and lowering the risk of information asymmetry. Consumers can clearly understand the origin, producer information, and production process of food, establishing trust in small farm brands. Additionally, blockchain technology can record every link of food from planting, breeding, processing, transportation to sales, and once a food safety issue occurs, it can quickly locate the problematic link and take effective measures.</p>
            <h4>1.4 Future Outlook: The Deep Integration of Blockchain and IoT</h4>
            <p>The application of blockchain technology in food traceability is still in its infancy, and in the future, it will be deeply integrated with IoT technology to achieve real-time monitoring and data collection of food production and transportation links, further enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of food traceability.

            <h3>II. Microplastics: The Invisible Threat of Food Packaging and Environmental Challenges</h3>
            <h4>2.1 Microplastics: Potential Threats in Modern Food Packaging</h4>
            <p>With the widespread use of plastic packaging, the issue of microplastics has gradually become a new challenge for food safety. Microplastics refer to plastic fragments or particles smaller than 5 millimeters in diameter, widely present in the natural environment, drinking water, and food. Food packaging materials, such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), are one of the main sources of microplastics. The residue, release, and migration of microplastics during production, use, and environmental migration make microplastics enter the food supply chain through various channels.</p>
            <h4>2.2 The Potential Threats of Microplastics to Health and the Environment</h4>
            <p>Microplastics not only affect the appearance and taste of food but may also pose multiple potential threats to human health. Microplastics may contain harmful chemicals, such as phthalates and bisphenol A, which may migrate from plastic packaging to food during processing or storage and then be ingested by the human body, affecting the endocrine system, reproductive system, and even potentially causing cancer. In addition, microplastics can adsorb harmful substances in the environment, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and persistent organic pollutants, increasing the risk of chronic poisoning and cancer.</p>
            <h4>2.3 Multidimensional Strategies to Address Microplastic Pollution</h4>
            <p>Facing the threat of microplastics to food safety, multidimensional measures are needed to reduce the generation and spread of microplastics at the source. Firstly, promoting the development of biodegradable and recyclable packaging materials, such as paper packaging, starch-based plastics, and bagasse packaging. Secondly, improving the production process of plastic packaging to reduce plastic particle residue and microplastic generation. Additionally, strengthening consumer education and policy supervision, advocating for the reduction of single-use plastic products, and formulating stricter microplastic detection standards and limit standards.</p>
            <h4>2.4 Future Outlook: Towards More Eco-Friendly Food Packaging</h4>
            <p>Solving the microplastic problem requires global cooperation and innovation. Bio-based materials (such as algae plastics, mycelium packaging, etc.) are expected to become important alternatives to plastic packaging, which are not only biodegradable but also reduce carbon emissions during production. The promotion of intelligent packaging technologies, such as traceable and monitorable packaging materials, will provide consumers with safer food choices. Global cooperation and policy promotion are also key to solving the microplastic problem, and governments should strengthen cooperation to jointly formulate global microplastic management policies.</p>
