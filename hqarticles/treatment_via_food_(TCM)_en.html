            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>TCM Dietary Therapy, a wisdom结晶 integrating medicine, nutrition, and dietary culture, has a long history and profound cultural heritage in China. From the "Huangdi Neijing" to the "Compendium of Materia Medica," ancient medical practitioners not only left behind rich theories of dietary therapy but also verified the close relationship between food and health through practical experience. Among numerous historical periods, the Song Dynasty, with its prosperous economy, open cultural atmosphere, and advanced medical achievements, became an important milestone in the development of dietary therapy culture. Today, with the progress of science and technology, research on molecular gastronomy and the gut microbiome has infused new vitality into dietary therapy, ushering in a new era of precision nutrition and personalized health management. This article will delve into the wisdom of Song Dynasty dietary therapy culture, combine it with modern nutritional knowledge, explore its scientific内涵 and practical significance, and consider how to integrate traditional cultural elements into modern dietary therapy products and services, creating dietary therapy brands with cultural特色.</p>

            <h2>1. Molecular Gastronomy × Dietary Therapy: The Technological Revolution in Precision Nutrition</h2>
            <h3>1. Molecular Gastronomy: The Technological Revolution in Precision Nutrition</h3>
            <p>The core of molecular gastronomy lies in controlling the molecular level of ingredients, using methods such as low-temperature slow cooking, foam technology, and gelation to decompose and reassemble ingredients, creating new textures and forms. This technology brings the greatest变革 to dietary therapy by achieving precise control of nutritional components. For example, traditional cooking methods often cause the loss of vitamins and active enzymes, while molecular gastronomy, through precise temperature control and processing methods, can retain the complete nutritional structure of ingredients while creating product forms more suitable for modern eating habits. Studies have shown that scientifically processed ingredients can increase the bioavailability of nutritional components by more than 30%.</p>
            <h3>2. Innovative Practices of Molecular Gastronomy in Dietary Therapy</h3>
            <p>Pumpkin soup foam is a typical example of applying molecular gastronomy technology to dietary therapy. Traditional pumpkin soup, although rich in taste after long-term stewing, easily causes nutritional loss. The pumpkin soup made with foam technology not only retains the rich β-carotene, vitamin C, and dietary fiber in the pumpkin but also provides a light and smooth texture.</p>
            <p>The attempt to simulate meat with algae-based gels breaks the nutritional limitations of vegetarianism. Through the gel structure formed by the reaction of sodium alginate and calcium ions, the texture and fiber感 of meat can be perfectly simulated, while providing abundant plant protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and minerals, offering more comprehensive nutritional support for vegetarians.</p>

            <h2>2. Gut Microbiome × Dietary Therapy: The Two-Way Interaction Between Gut Health and Overall Health</h2>
            <h3>1. The Gut Microbiome: The "Second Brain"</h3>
            <p>The gut microbiome is composed of hundreds of species of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other microorganisms, with a total number exceeding 100 trillion, ten times the total number of human cells. These microorganisms form a complex symbiotic relationship with the human body, participating in various physiological processes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digestion and Absorption</strong>: Certain bacteria help decompose food components that the human body cannot directly digest, such as cellulose, releasing short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) that provide energy for intestinal cells.</li>
                <li><strong>Immune Regulation</strong>: The gut is the largest immune organ in the human body, with about 70% of immune cells concentrated in the gut. The gut microbiome trains the immune system, helping the body identify and resist pathogens.</li>
                <li><strong>Metabolic Regulation</strong>: The gut microbiome participates in regulating blood sugar, lipid levels, and body weight, and even affects the synthesis of certain vitamins, such as vitamin K and B vitamins.</li>
                <li><strong>Neural Interaction</strong>: The gut communicates with the brain through the "gut-brain axis," influencing emotions, stress responses, and cognitive functions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. The Two-Way Interaction Between Dietary Therapy and the Gut Microbiome</h3>
            <p>Food is not only a source of energy but also a key factor in shaping the gut microbiome. Different foods affect the composition and function of the microbiome, thereby affecting the health status of the human body. Conversely, the state of the gut microbiome also affects the efficiency of human digestion and absorption of food.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prebiotics</strong>: Prebiotics are indigestible food components that can be decomposed and utilized by beneficial bacteria in the gut, promoting their growth. Common prebiotics include inulin, fructo-oligosaccharides, and resistant starch.</li>
                <li><strong>Fermented Foods</strong>: Fermented foods are rich in probiotics, which can directly supplement beneficial microorganisms in the gut. Common fermented foods include yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut, miso, and natto.</li>
                <li><strong>Dietary Fiber</strong>: Dietary fiber is divided into soluble and insoluble types, with soluble fiber being fermented by gut bacteria to produce short-chain fatty acids that provide energy for intestinal cells.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Personalized Gut Microbiome Testing and Dietary Therapy Plans</h3>
            <p>Each person's gut microbiome composition is unique, influenced by factors such as genes, environment, and eating habits. In recent years, with the development of gene sequencing technology, personalized gut microbiome testing has become possible. Based on the test results, personalized dietary therapy plans can be formulated, such as increasing foods rich in prebiotics and various dietary fibers, increasing the intake of fermented foods, and reducing high-fat and high-sugar foods.</p>
