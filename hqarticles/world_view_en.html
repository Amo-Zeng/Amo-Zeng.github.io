            <h2>The Universe and Human Mission</h2>
            <p>The universe, this existence filled with endless mysteries and possibilities, has attracted continuous exploration and thought from humanity since ancient times. From gazing up at the stars to trying to understand the vastness of the universe, to facing the mysteries of dark matter and challenging the limits of our cognition, we gradually realize that our understanding of the universe is also a deepening of our self-cognition. In this journey across the "arrow of time," we are not only exploring the physical composition of the universe but also seeking the meaning and mission of human existence.</p>

            <h3>"Dark Matter": A Challenge at the Boundaries of Cognition</h3>
            <p>Dark matter, which occupies the majority of the universe's mass but exists beyond our current physical framework, is like a huge puzzle the universe has thrown at humanity. It reminds us that despite great scientific advances, our understanding of the universe is still just a drop in the ocean, with vast unknown realms still waiting to be explored. The existence of dark matter not only challenges our traditional understanding of matter composition and natural laws but also forces us to re-examine the limitations of scientific methods.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limitations of Scientific Progress:</strong> The presence of dark matter reminds us that scientific methods are not all-powerful, and there are still many unknown areas to explore.</li>
                <li><strong>Importance of Exploration Spirit:</strong> The mystery of dark matter stimulates human curiosity and the desire for exploration, driving scientific progress.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The "Multiverse" and "Multi-Self": Self-Cognition in Infinite Possibilities</h3>
            <p>The "multiverse" hypothesis shifts our gaze from the external structure of the universe to a deeper realm: self-cognition. The "multiverse" theory suggests that our universe is not unique but one of countless parallel universes. Each universe has different physical rules, historical processes, and possibly entirely different life forms. If this hypothesis is true, then our universe is merely one of the infinite possibilities.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Deepening Self-Cognition:</strong> The concept of the multiverse makes us rethink the concepts of "free will" and "destiny."</li>
                <li><strong>Creating a Unique Life:</strong> Even if there are countless parallel universes, we can still create a unique life through our own efforts.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The "Arrow of Time" and Human Mission: Historical Responsibility from a Cosmic Perspective</h3>
            <p>The evolution of the universe follows an irreversible "arrow of time"â€”a transition from a low-entropy state to a high-entropy state. This process is not only a basic law of physics but also the core clue of cosmic history. However, when we connect the "arrow of time" with human mission from a human perspective, a new depth of discussion emerges: Does the evolution of the universe imply that humanity bears a special mission to "drive progress"?</p>
            <p>The "arrow of time" reveals the irreversible process of the universe transitioning from order to disorder. In this process, the dispersal of energy and the increase of entropy are inevitable. Yet, against this backdrop, humanity, as part of the universe, exhibits unique creativity and innovative spirit. Human history is one of continuous pursuit of progress, exploration of the unknown, and challenging limits. From the Stone Age to the Information Age, humanity has continuously left its mark on the universe's "arrow of time" through technological development, cultural heritage, and social progress.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Universe, Self, and Mission</h3>
            <p>From "dark matter" to "multi-self," from the "arrow of time" to "historical responsibility," we are embarking on a profound transformation concerning self-cognition and human mission. This transformation will not only change our understanding of the universe but also reshape our thinking about self-value.</p>
