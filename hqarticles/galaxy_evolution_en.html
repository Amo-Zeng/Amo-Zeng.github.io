            <h2>Galactic Evolution: The New Frontier of Cosmology</h2>
            <p>The evolution of galaxies is one of the central issues in modern cosmology, not only involving the formation and structural changes of galaxies, but also including their interaction with large-scale cosmic structures. With the rapid advancement of technology, a series of future cosmology experiments, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), the European Space Agency's Euclid mission, and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will bring unprecedented data and insights to the study of galactic evolution. These instruments will not only deepen our understanding of galactic evolution but also reveal the intricate interactions between dark matter, dark energy, and galactic evolution.</p>
