            <h2>Future Trends: The Potential of Quantum Computing in GPUs</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of quantum computing, future GPUs may integrate quantum computing capabilities, forming "Quantum GPUs." This combination will significantly enhance the speed of solving complex problems, particularly in fields such as materials science, drug development, and climate modeling. Quantum GPUs will not only handle existing parallel computing tasks but also solve complex problems that classical computers find challenging through quantum acceleration.</p>

            <h2>AI Applications: The Fusion of GPUs and Neuromorphic Computing</h2>
            <p>The role of GPUs in AI will extend beyond accelerating deep learning to integrating with neuromorphic computing (Neuromorphic Computing), mimicking the neural network structure of the human brain. This fusion will enable AI systems to achieve higher energy efficiency and stronger autonomous learning capabilities, driving the development of brain-like computing, especially in areas like autonomous driving, intelligent robotics, and natural language processing.</p>

            <h2>Innovations in Computer Graphics: Light Field Rendering and Holographic Display</h2>
            <p>Innovations in computer graphics by GPUs will transcend current rendering technologies, entering the realms of light field rendering (Light Field Rendering) and holographic display (Holographic Display). Light field rendering will support seamless switching between multiple perspectives, making virtual scenes more realistic; while holographic display will allow users to interact directly with virtual objects in three-dimensional space, pushing the applications of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) to a new level.</p>
