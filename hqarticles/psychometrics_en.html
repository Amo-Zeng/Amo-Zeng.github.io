            <h2>Psychometrics: From History to the Future, AI Integration and Challenges</h2>
            <p>Psychometrics, as an important branch of psychology, is dedicated to quantifying and measuring individual psychological characteristics and behaviors. Beginning with Alfred Binet's intelligence tests in the late 19th century, this discipline has undergone over a century of development, not only deepening its theoretical foundation but also achieving widespread success in application areas. Today, with the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, psychometrics is experiencing new opportunities and challenges, opening up unprecedented new frontiers.</p>
