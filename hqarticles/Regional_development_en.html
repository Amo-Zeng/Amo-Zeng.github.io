            <h3>I. The Essence and Value of Social Capital</h3>
            <h4>1. Definition of Social Capital</h4>
            <p>Social capital refers to the trust, norms, and reciprocal relationships that exist within social networks. It is not just an intangible asset but also a crucial mechanism for social development. In regional development, social capital manifests as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trust among community members</strong>: Trust is at the core of social capital, promoting cooperation and reducing social friction.</li>
                <li><strong>Informal social networks</strong>: These include kinship, friendships, and neighborhood relations, providing support when it's critical.</li>
                <li><strong>Civic engagement</strong>: The active involvement of citizens is a significant indicator of social capital; the higher the engagement, the stronger the social cohesion.</li>
                <li><strong>Social norms and values</strong>: These guide people's behavior, forming a collective social identity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Economic Value of Social Capital</h4>
            <p>Strong social capital can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce transaction costs: Trust and mutual help decrease the costs of supervision and contract enforcement.</li>
                <li>Enhance information flow: Information spreads quickly and widely within social networks.</li>
                <li>Boost innovation capacity: Through collaboration and exchange, innovative ideas are quickly disseminated and realized.</li>
                <li>Improve social cooperation efficiency: Good social relationships can minimize friction in cooperation, enhancing efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
