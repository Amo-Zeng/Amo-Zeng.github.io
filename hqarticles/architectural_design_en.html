            <ul>
                <li><strong>Light Magician:</strong> Natural light is the most effective "anti-depressant." Bright light stimulates dopamine secretion and elevates mood. In architectural design, the rational use of natural light, such as designing open windows and skylights, can effectively improve the psychological state of residents, bringing warmth and vitality.</li>
                <li><strong>Space Healing Power:</strong> Spacious areas bring a sense of psychological relaxation. In cities, well-designed large spaces can make people feel free and comfortable. Appropriate partitions and private space design can provide psychological security. The fluidity and层次感 of space are not only a manifestation of functionality but also a comfort to the soul.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Psychological Warfare:</strong> Colors have a direct impact on emotions. For example, blue brings a sense of tranquility, suitable for bedrooms and meditation spaces; green symbolizes life and nature, capable of relieving stress; bright yellow can enhance positive emotions. The clever use of color can inject emotions into architectural spaces, creating specific atmospheres to help residents regulate their emotions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Ecological Symbiosis: The Architectural Design Revolution in Sustainable Development</h3>
            <p>Facing the challenges of global climate change and resource depletion, architectural design is shifting toward sustainable development. From "carbon neutrality" to "ecological symbiosis," architectural design not only needs to reduce carbon emissions but also establish a mutually beneficial relationship with the natural environment, achieving harmony between humans and nature.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Carbon Neutrality and Ecological Symbiosis:</strong> Architectural design must maximize carbon reduction in every lifecycle stage and achieve net-zero carbon emissions through the use of renewable energy. At the same time, architectural design must go beyond simple carbon reduction and move toward "ecological symbiosis," achieving deep integration with the natural environment and creating a sustainable future.</li>
                <li><strong>System Symbiosis:</strong> Ecological symbiotic architecture emphasizes the mutually beneficial relationship between architecture and the natural environment. By simulating natural ecosystems, design can self-regulate environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, reducing reliance on artificial equipment. Additionally, creating vertical greening and bio-walls can provide habitats for plants and animals, promoting biodiversity and achieving harmony between humans and nature.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Equity:</strong> Sustainable architectural design should not only pursue technological leadership but also consider its social value. By developing affordable green building technologies, architects can provide low-income groups with green housing, improving their living environments. It is the architects' responsibility to not only pursue aesthetics and functionality but also to focus on social equity and sustainable development.</li>
