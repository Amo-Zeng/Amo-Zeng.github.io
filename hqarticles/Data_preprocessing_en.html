            <h2>Depth and Breadth of Data Preprocessing: Quality Evolution and Application Innovation Driven by AI</h2>
            <p>In the era of data-driven decision-making, data is hailed as "the new oil," underscoring its immense value. However, the true worth of data lies not in its raw form but in the high-quality information that is meticulously refined and processed. Data preprocessing, a core component of data science, is indispensable. It goes beyond mere data cleaning and organization; it is the critical step to unveil the deep stories hidden within the data. This article delves into the depth and breadth of data preprocessing, particularly its quality evolution and application innovation driven by artificial intelligence.</p>

            <h3>1. Mining Data Generation Processes: Unveiling the Deep Stories of Data</h3>
            <p>Data is not merely a collection of numbers and symbols; it reflects human behavior and social phenomena. The processes through which data is generated often contain rich contextual information and intrinsic logic. Traditional data preprocessing methods typically focus on filling missing values and identifying outliers, overlooking how data is generated. By deeply mining the data generation process, we can better understand the inherent logic and patterns of the data.</p>
            <p>For example, in survey research, the purpose of each question, the motivation of respondents, and the overall design of the questionnaire are all crucial backgrounds for data generation. Understanding these backgrounds not only affects the authenticity and completeness of the data but also determines its interpretability and application value. Recognizing the possible motives of respondents when answering sensitive questions can help us clean and analyze the data more accurately. This approach not only enhances data quality but also improves its practicality and interpretability.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>2. Integrating External Knowledge: Enhancing the Dynamic Evolution of Data Quality</h3>
            <p>Data preprocessing should not be conducted in isolation; external knowledge is a crucial reference for data processing. External knowledge includes domain expertise, related research findings, historical data, etc. This knowledge helps us comprehensively understand the data, enhancing its quality and interpretability.</p>
            <p>Take user profiling as an example. Relying solely on statistical analysis of data may not accurately reflect users' true characteristics. However, combining psychological research findings allows us to understand users' potential motives and behavior patterns more deeply, enabling more accurate missing value imputation and anomaly detection. This approach not only enhances data quality but also improves its practicality and interpretability.</p>
            <p>In the data-driven era, data quality is not static; it evolves dynamically with time, technology, business demands, and other factors. Therefore, dynamic data quality management is a continuous marathon for enterprises, rather than a one-time sprint. Enterprises need to establish dynamic data quality management mechanisms, develop dynamic rules for data quality management, employ automated data quality management tools, and cultivate interdisciplinary talents in data quality and data governance.</p>
