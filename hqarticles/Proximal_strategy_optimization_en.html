            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and machine learning, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly used to tackle complex tasks. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) aims to achieve efficient task objectives through the interaction and cooperation of multiple agents. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), as a stable and efficient policy gradient method, excels not only in single-agent reinforcement learning but is also widely applied in MARL. However, as application scenarios expand, such as autonomous driving, medical decision-making, and industrial robot operations, the integration of safety and human feedback has become a focal point of research. This article explores how to combine PPO with safety considerations and human feedback to build a more adaptive and secure framework for multi-agent cooperative learning.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>PPO Algorithm and Its Application in Multi-Agent Systems</h2>
            <p>PPO enhances learning stability by limiting the magnitude of policy updates, with two main implementations: PPO-Clip and PPO-Penalty. These methods face challenges in multi-agent environments including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Non-stationarity:</strong> Due to simultaneous policy updates of multiple agents, the environment's non-stationarity increases.</li>
                <li><strong>Credit Assignment:</strong> How to correctly allocate global rewards to individual agents.</li>
                <li><strong>Cooperation and Competition:</strong> Agents might have cooperative or competitive relationships.</li>
                <li><strong>Communication and Information Sharing:</strong> How agents effectively exchange information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To address these challenges, researchers have developed methods like MAPPO (Multi-Agent PPO) and COMA (Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients), which optimize the cooperative learning process through shared global value functions or using counterfactual baselines.</p>

            <h2>Building a Safe Reinforcement Learning Framework</h2>
            <p>In applications where safety is critical, merely maximizing cumulative rewards is insufficient. A PPO-based safe reinforcement learning framework introduces the following key elements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Safety Constraints:</strong> Modify the reward function or add constraints to the optimization objective to ensure the safety of agent behavior. For example, in autonomous driving, avoid speeding or dangerous lane changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Awareness:</strong> Incorporate uncertainty estimation or Bayesian methods to assess the potential risk of actions, ensuring safety in decision-making.</li>
                <li><strong>Safe Policy Exploration:</strong> Introduce safety thresholds when exploring new policies, only exploring when the estimated safety meets the requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Failure Recovery Mechanisms:</strong> When agents enter unsafe states, quickly adjust policies back to safe areas.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Integration of Human Feedback</h2>
            <p>Integrating human feedback into PPO's multi-agent cooperative learning can be achieved through the following ways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Reward Shaping:</strong> Adjust the reward function based on human feedback to better align with human values and expectations. For instance, in medical decision-making, feedback from human experts helps avoid overtreatment.</li>
                <li><strong>Policy Adjustment:</strong> During PPO's policy updates, consider human-provided preference data to adjust the direction of policy updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Loop:</strong> Establish a continuous feedback loop to adjust strategies in real-time during the learning process to adapt to human expectations and environmental changes.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Case Studies and Applications</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intelligent Transportation Systems:</strong> Multiple autonomous vehicles coordinate driving with PPO, incorporating safety constraints to reduce traffic accidents, and optimizing passenger experience through human feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>UAV Swarm:</strong> Drones learn to fly in coordination using PPO, with safety mechanisms to prevent collisions, and adjust flying strategies based on feedback from human operators.</li>
                <li><strong>Game AI:</strong> In multiplayer games, PPO-trained AI can adjust its behavior based on feedback from human players to make the game more enjoyable and fair.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Diagnosis:</strong> In the medical field, PPO, combined with feedback from human experts, learns more accurate diagnostic models while ensuring the safety of treatment plans.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Challenges and Future Directions</h2>
            <p>While PPO combined with safety considerations and human feedback in multi-agent cooperative learning shows great potential, there are still challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Feedback Quality and Consistency:</strong> Ensuring the effectiveness and consistency of human feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Objective Optimization:</strong> Balancing safety, task objectives, and human expectations.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Changes:</strong> Addressing safety issues under dynamic environmental changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Computational Efficiency:</strong> Improving training efficiency under safety constraints.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Future research might include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developing more advanced safety metrics and evaluation methods.</li>
                <li>Exploring adaptive policy update mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Combining with other safety algorithms, like Shielding techniques.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Applying PPO in multi-agent cooperative learning, combined with safety considerations and human feedback, provides new perspectives and methods for solving complex tasks. This integrative approach not only enhances learning efficiency and stability but also ensures that the decision-making process of agents is safer and more aligned with human values. As technology advances and application demands grow, this integration will demonstrate its potential in more fields, pushing the widespread application of multi-agent systems in real-world scenarios.</p>
