                <p>In the wave of the digital age, crowdfunding platforms have long transcended their simple financing function, quietly evolving into a "cultural barometer" reflecting the collective psyche of society. From 2020 to 2024, the global economy experienced sustained fluctuations under the multiple impacts of the recurring COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, high inflation, and tightening monetary policies. During these five years, the project types, narrative styles, and support models on platforms from Kickstarter and Indiegogo to JD Crowdfunding have all recorded a profound migration of social sentiment from "outward exploration" to "inward settling."</p>

            <section>
                <h3>I. The Shift Behind the Data: Project Type Evolution and Economic Fluctuations</h3>
                <p>According to Kickstarter's annual report data, between 2020-2021, technology and innovative hardware projects (such as smart wearables, home robots, eco-tech) accounted for 34% of all successful projects, with total funding increasing by 28% year-on-year. The crowdfunding landscape during this phase was filled with techno-optimism, reflecting society's collective desire for "future solutions."</p>
                
                <p>The turning point occurred in 2022. As major global central banks entered rate-hiking cycles and economic expectations weakened, the trend in crowdfunding projects changed significantly. Indiegogo platform data shows that in 2022-2023, the number of "emotional healing" product projects (such as aroma diffusers, meditation aids, art therapy toolkits) grew by 61%, while supporter numbers for "retro and nostalgic" products (such as vintage-style radios, handmade pottery, paper book subscription boxes) rose by 49%. JD Crowdfunding's 2023 Trends Report similarly pointed out that practical and psychological comfort projects like "home mini planting kits," "emergency supply boxes," and "mind-body relaxation devices" had a success rate as high as 78%, far exceeding the 52% for tech products.</p>
                
                <p>This shift clearly reflects that against a backdrop of heightened economic uncertainty, public psychology has transitioned from outward expansion of "changing the world" to an inward search for security of "guarding the self." Crowdfunding is no longer just a financing channel for dreams but has become an informal compensation mechanism for societal psychological needs.</p>

                <h3>II. The Evolution of Rhetoric: From "Revolutionary" to "Healing"</h3>
                <p>The evolution of project promotional language is equally intriguing. In 2020, an AI learning device called "OmniMind" emphasized "reshaping education, unleashing human potential" in its crowdfunding campaign, successfully raising $2.2 million. Its language was full of disruptiveness and grand vision, aligning with the collective societal yearning for technological revolution at the time.</p>
                
                <p>By 2023, however, a silent stress-relief hug pillow named "Silent Hug" raised nearly one million yuan with the slogan "In a noisy world, give you a quiet hug." It no longer emphasized tech specs or social change but directly addressed contemporary loneliness and anxiety. Similarly, a project page for a handmade crochet kit wrote: "Not producing goods, but weaving heartfelt meaning," echoing people's desire for "authenticity" and "human touch."</p>
                
                <p>Semantic analysis shows that high-frequency words for crowdfunding projects in 2020 were "innovation," "disrupt," "future"; whereas by 2022-2024, the frequency of words like "warmth," "companionship," "healing," "security" increased by 320%. Behind this change in discourse is a shift in collective social sentiment from "longing for the future" to "settling the present," an emotional response to the era of rapid digitization and uncertainty.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>III. Typical Case Comparison: The Two Poles of Tech Dreams and Emotional Care</h3>
                <p>The "NeuroBloom" project (2021) is a typical case of techno-optimism. This wearable device, which claimed to improve mood through brainwaves, received significant attention during funding but was heavily criticized due to a huge gap between promised and actual experience. Supporters complained that "it couldn't truly understand my emotions."</p>
                
                <p>In contrast, the "Memory Grove" project launched in 2023—a kit allowing users to grow small plants and record daily moods—did not emphasize high technology but instead used the theme "accompany your every emotional growth," gaining far more than expected user-generated sharing and long-term repurchase.</p>
                
                <p>The contrasting fates of these two projects reveal that contemporary consumers are increasingly rejecting "over-promising" and embracing "genuine connection." Products that provide emotional value are more resilient than those solely emphasizing advanced functionality.</p>

                <h3>IV. Implications: Crowdfunding as a Detector of Social Mentality</h3>
                <p>This series of changes provides multiple implications for different groups:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>For entrepreneurs</strong>, crowdfunding is no longer just a place to validate product concepts but also a window to gain insight into users' deep emotional needs. Understanding social sentiment, returning to human-centric design, and grasping "small yet certain" happiness may resonate more easily than pursuing "disruptive innovation."</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>For social researchers</strong>, crowdfunding platforms become an "open laboratory" continuously generating social psychological data. By analyzing project initiation and support behaviors, one can more实时ly and细腻ly capture the changes in group anxieties, hopes, and values, thus supplementing the lag and limitations of traditional social mentality research.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>For policymakers</strong>, the emergence of project types like "self-healing," "community mutual aid," and "sustainable living" on crowdfunding platforms are actually spontaneous responses to social needs. They hint at deficiencies or gaps in public policy regarding mental health support, community network building, and fostering a resilient economy, and should be considered an important reference for adjusting social policies.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Conclusion: Finding Certainty in Uncertainty</h3>
                <p>The evolution of crowdfunding platforms reflects the spirit of an era. The shift in rhetoric from "changing the world" to "healing oneself" is not a retreat but a self-adjustment of the collective social psyche amidst economic fluctuations and technological acceleration. It tells us that no matter how the times change, humans always crave connection, meaning, and understanding. And crowdfunding acts like a mirror, reflecting our innermost, most genuine needs and warmth.</p>
