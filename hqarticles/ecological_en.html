            <h2>Intersection of Ecology and Human Health</h2>
            <p>In modern society, human health issues are increasingly being given attention. However, traditional health research often focuses on individual physiological and psychological aspects, neglecting the importance of environments and ecosystems. The intersection of ecology and human health aims to explore how natural environments affect human health, thus providing new ideas and methods for public health. This article will delve into the ecological dimensions of human health.</p>

            <h3>Ecosystem Services and Human Health</h3>
            <p>Ecosystem services provided by nature, such as air purification, water quality improvement, and climate regulation, have direct and indirect impacts on human health. For instance, urban green spaces not only offer recreational areas but also improve air quality by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, reducing the incidence of respiratory diseases. Additionally, forests and other natural environments provide spaces for mental rehabilitation, helping people alleviate stress and enhance their quality of life.</p>

            <h3>Ecosystem Changes and Human Health Risks</h3>
            <p>Changes in ecosystems, such as climate change, land use changes, and loss of biodiversity, can bring various health risks. For example, extreme weather events caused by climate change, such as floods and droughts, can affect basic human living needs like food and water supplies. Moreover, the reduction of biodiversity may lead to changes in the transmission patterns of infectious diseases, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks.</p>

            <h3>Application of Ecology in Public Health</h3>
            <p>Ecological methods can be used to assess the health of ecosystems and identify potential health risks. For instance, by monitoring water quality and biodiversity, one can predict the impact of water pollution on human health and take preventive measures. Ecological restoration projects, such as urban wetland restoration and river ecological rehabilitation, not only enhance the health of ecosystems but also improve human health. Restoring urban wetlands can provide natural water purification functions, reducing the impact of water pollution on human health. At the same time, these restoration projects also offer recreational and educational opportunities, strengthening community cohesion and residents' well-being.</p>

            <h3>Ecology and Mental Health</h3>
            <p>The influence of the natural environment on human mental health is equally significant. Research shows that exposure to natural environments can reduce mental stress and anxiety, and improve happiness. Urban green spaces and parks provide residents with natural recreational areas, helping to alleviate work stress and the tension of urban life. Furthermore, natural environments can stimulate creativity and cognitive functions, especially important for the development of children and adolescents.</p>

            <h3>Future Outlook</h3>
            <p>The intersection of ecology and human health provides new ideas and methods for public health. By deeply understanding the connection between ecosystems and human health, scientific basis can be provided for the formulation of public health policies. In the future, with the deepening of ecological research and technological advancements, we can anticipate more comprehensive and in-depth health promotion strategies, thereby achieving higher health standards and better quality of life.</p>
