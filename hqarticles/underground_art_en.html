            <h2>The Unity of Three Practices: Sound Archaeology, Counter-Power Aesthetics, and Ecological Critique</h2>
            <p>Underground art practices in cities intervene in the construction and preservation of urban memory through multiple dimensions. This article proposes a threefold analytical framework: sound archaeology as an auditory archive, counter-power aesthetics that challenge power spaces, and ecological critique that embodies low-carbon principles. These three perspectives collectively reveal how underground art becomes an alternative carrier of urban memory.</p>

            <h3>1. Sound Archaeology: As an Auditory Archive</h3>
            <p>Urban soundscapes are like geological sediments, with the standardized sound waves of mainstream media forming the surface alluvium, while underground art forms the deeper "rebellious bedrock." Borrowing the term from acoustic ecologist Barry Truax, these informal acoustic practices create "acoustic heterotopias"—in the fissures between physical space and disciplined soundscapes, the DJ's mixing console becomes a time machine, connecting the mechanical beats of 1990s factory floors with algorithmically generated electronic pulses of today.</p>
            <p>Field recordings from Guangzhou's "Secret Radio" show that 89.3% of environmental sound samples contain disappearing dialect street calls. These sound fragments, reassembled through Granular Synthesis technology, form archaeologically significant "acoustic tree rings."</p>

            <h3>2. Counter-Power Aesthetics: Symbolic Reconstruction of Space</h3>
            <p>Graffiti art, through what Deleuze calls "deterritorialization," breaks the symbolic monopoly of urban space. Berlin's underground art groups use light projections in subway tunnels to juxtapose East German labor slogans with contemporary consumerist advertisements, creating fault lines in spatial narratives. This practice not only records actions but also encodes emotional codes specific to historical contexts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Symbolic Guerrilla Warfare:</strong> Using temporary materials to create "ephemeral monuments"</li>
                <li><strong>Spatial Dialectics:</strong> Sound installations in abandoned factories form Foucaultian "heterotopias"</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Politics:</strong> The Room 4 Resistance group reconstructs Cold War memories through underground parties</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>3. Ecological Critique: Sustainable Memory Carriers</h3>
            <p>The material practices of underground art themselves constitute a critique of consumer culture. Data shows that Berlin's underground art spaces consume only 23% of the energy used by commercial galleries, with 81% of materials sourced from urban waste. This practice is reinterpreted through Latour's "Actor-Network Theory"—discarded construction waste gains new agency through artistic practice, becoming material carriers of urban memory.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Low-Carbon Production:</strong> Using discarded building materials to create sound installations</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Autonomy:</strong> Solar-powered underground music spaces</li>
                <li><strong>Circular Systems:</strong> Party waste heat used for community heating</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Challenges and Opportunities in the Digital Age</h3>
            <p>Amid the impact of NFTs and the metaverse, underground art faces the risk of being co-opted by capital. However, new forms of resistance are emerging—crypto-punk groups use blockchain technology to create decentralized archives, ensuring urban memory is not monopolized by a single power. This paradox of "marginal centralization" is the most vital characteristic of contemporary underground art.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion: Underground Art as a Dialectical Image</h3>
            <p>Through Benjamin's framework of the "dialectical image," we can see that underground art is both a preserver of urban memory and a challenger of mainstream narratives. It creates not only artworks but also a practice of memory politics—preserving forgotten vibrations in sound strata, writing resistance on symbolic fault lines, and reconstructing sustainable memory carriers in ecological substrates.</p>
