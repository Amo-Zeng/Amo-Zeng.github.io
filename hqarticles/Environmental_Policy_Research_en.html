            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As global environmental issues become increasingly severe, governments and international organizations around the world have introduced a series of environmental policies aimed at reducing pollution, protecting natural resources, and promoting sustainable development. However, the implementation and supervision of these policies have always been major challenges in the environmental field. Traditional regulatory methods often suffer from information asymmetry, data tampering, and poor enforcement, leading to a significant reduction in policy effectiveness. In recent years, blockchain technology, with its decentralized, tamper-proof, and highly transparent characteristics, has provided new solutions for the implementation and supervision of environmental policies. At the same time, interdisciplinary integration has become an important approach to driving innovation in environmental policies. This article will explore the innovation of environmental policies based on blockchain technology and interdisciplinary integration, analyze its advantages and challenges, and look forward to future development directions.</p>

            <h2>Overview of Blockchain Technology</h2>
            <p>Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that ensures data security and immutability through cryptographic algorithms. Each block contains a certain number of transaction records, which are linked together through timestamps and the hash value of the previous block, forming a continuously growing chain. The core features of blockchain include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> There is no central authority controlling the network; all participants collectively maintain it.</li>
                <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Once data is recorded, it cannot be modified or deleted.</li>
                <li><strong>High Transparency:</strong> All transaction records are open to all participants, ensuring transparency of information.</li>
                <li><strong>High Security:</strong> Data security is ensured through cryptographic algorithms and consensus mechanisms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Innovations in Environmental Policy from the Perspective of Environmental Justice</h2>
            <p>Environmental justice (Environmental Justice) is a multi-dimensional concept that not only focuses on environmental issues themselves but also involves social equity, economic equality, and political participation. The core of environmental justice lies in ensuring that all populations, regardless of their race, gender, income level, or social status, can enjoy a clean, healthy, and safe environment. From the perspective of environmental justice, the formulation and implementation of environmental policies should follow the following principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> Policies should ensure that all populations can equally enjoy environmental resources and avoid unfairly distributing environmental burdens to specific groups.</li>
                <li><strong>Participation:</strong> The policy-making process should widely solicit opinions from all sectors of society, especially residents of affected communities, to ensure that their voices are heard.</li>
                <li><strong>
