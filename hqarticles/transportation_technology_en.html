            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The rapid urbanization process has increasingly made transportation a critical bottleneck constraining urban development and social equity. Issues such as uneven distribution of transportation resources, differentiated service provision, and the technology gap are deepening social inequality. However, with the rise of emerging technologies like Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and micromobility, we are presented with a new opportunity to reshape urban transportation networks and promote social equity.</p>

            <h2>I. Intelligent Transportation Systems: The Digital Nervous System of Urban Traffic</h2>
            <p>The deep integration of Intelligent Transportation Systems with urban planning is becoming a key pathway to solving urban traffic challenges and driving sustainable urban development. The core of ITS lies in data-driven decision-making and efficient collaboration. By utilizing sensors, cameras, and GPS devices throughout the city, ITS collects real-time data on traffic flow, road conditions, vehicle information, and more, establishing a comprehensive traffic big data platform. Advanced big data analysis and machine learning technologies are then applied to deeply mine this data, providing scientific foundations for traffic management decisions, enabling dynamic control of traffic signals, intelligent route planning, and optimal resource allocation.</p>
            <p>The "dual-wheel drive" of urban planning and ITS is the core of smart transportation. Based on traffic big data collected by ITS, combined with factors such as urban population, economy, and land use, precise traffic demand forecasts can be made, providing a scientific basis for urban transportation planning. Using ITS simulation capabilities, urban traffic network layouts can be optimized, and infrastructure such as roads, buses, subways, and bike lanes can be reasonably planned, constructing a multimodal, integrated transportation system. This integration not only significantly improves the efficiency of the transportation system but also provides urban residents with a more convenient and efficient travel experience.</p>

            <h2>II. Micromobility: The Capillaries of Future Urban Transportation</h2>
            <p>Micromobility tools, such as shared scooters, electric bicycles, and lightweight electric vehicles, are changing people's travel patterns at an unprecedented pace. These tools, characterized by their flexibility, convenience, and low carbon emissions, are rapidly filling the demand for short-distance travel, greatly enhancing the efficiency of short-distance travel, and providing new solutions to the "last mile" problem in urban transportation.</p>
            <p>In the future, micromobility will develop in a more intelligent and personalized direction. With continuous advancements in IoT and AI technologies, micromobility tools will become "smarter," capable of precise positioning, intelligent scheduling, and even data interaction with urban transportation systems, offering users a more efficient and safe travel experience. Additionally, the variety of micromobility tools will become more diverse, evolving from single-purpose transportation tools into multifunctional carriers that integrate entertainment, fitness, and social functions, meeting more personalized user needs.</p>
            <p>However, the development of micromobility also faces numerous challenges. Issues such as regulation, safety, and user experience need to be addressed. Urban managers need to develop scientific and reasonable policies to guide the healthy development of micromobility; enterprises need to continuously improve their technical levels and service quality to create a better travel experience for users. Only in this way can micromobility truly become the capillaries of future urban transportation, injecting new vitality into sustainable urban development.</p>

            <h2>III. Transportation Technology: A Catalyst for Social Equity</h2>
            <p>The equity issues surrounding transportation technology have garnered widespread attention. Intelligent transportation technologies offer new possibilities for achieving equity. Demand-forecasting algorithms can accurately allocate public transportation resources, ensuring that remote areas also receive sufficient bus services. Real-time traffic information systems enable passengers to plan their trips reasonably, enhancing the attractiveness of public transportation.</p>
            <p>Barrier-free design is a crucial prerequisite for achieving transportation equity. Smart voice navigation systems, accessible boarding assistance devices, and other technologies make public transportation more accessible for the elderly and disabled. Low-cost shared mobility platforms provide an economical travel option for low-income groups. Data-driven decision-making systems are reshaping the allocation model of transportation resources. Through big data analysis, the travel needs of vulnerable groups can be accurately identified, allowing for more targeted transportation policies. Intelligent scheduling systems can optimize resource allocation, improving the overall efficiency of the transportation system.</p>
            <p>Multi-stakeholder collaboration is key to achieving transportation equity. Government departments, tech companies, and social organizations need to work together to jointly promote the construction of intelligent transportation systems. The government sets equity standards, enterprises provide technical support, and social organizations participate in supervisionâ€”this requires a complete social governance ecosystem. Technological innovation must consider equity. Vehicle-sharing systems should cover a wider population, public transportation should be intelligent for all residents, and the development of autonomous driving technology should take into account the needs of different groups. The development direction of transportation technology should always be guided by the goal of promoting social equity.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Intelligent Transportation Systems, micromobility technologies, and the role of transportation technology in enhancing social equity together form a comprehensive picture of future transportation technology. Through these innovations and applications, we will reshape the paradigm of urban transportation development, creating a more convenient, efficient, safe, and green travel environment for urban residents, driving cities toward a smarter and more livable future. The construction of intelligent transportation systems requires the joint efforts of the government, enterprises, and society. Only in this way can we truly achieve intelligent, green, and equitable transportation, steering toward a better future together.</p>
