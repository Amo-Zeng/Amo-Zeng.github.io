            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Inter-school collaboration has become an essential part of the modern educational system. With the acceleration of globalization and the rise of the knowledge economy, the resources and perspectives of a single school are no longer sufficient to meet the comprehensive development needs of students. Inter-school collaboration not only expands the scope of learning for students but also promotes the sharing of educational resources, innovative teaching methods, and improves educational quality. Collaboration takes various forms, from shared courses and faculty to joint research projects, international exchanges, and cultural exchanges, each bringing new vitality and depth to education.</p>

            <h3>I. Resource Sharing: Definition, Importance, Success Stories, and Challenges</h3>
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>Resource sharing refers to the sharing of teaching resources, equipment, facilities, or human resources between different schools.</p>
            <h4>Importance</h4>
            <p>This cooperation can significantly reduce educational costs, increase resource utilization, avoid duplication of efforts, and provide students with more learning opportunities.</p>
            <h4>Success Stories</h4>
            <p>For example, the "Educational Resource Sharing Consortium" in the U.S. allows member schools to share laboratory equipment, library resources, and online courses, significantly enhancing educational quality.</p>
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resource Disparity</strong>: Differences in resources among schools might lead to inequity in cooperation.</li>
                <li><strong>Coordination Difficulties</strong>: Differences in management styles and cultural differences require coordination.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Solutions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Establish fair mechanisms for resource sharing to ensure all participating schools benefit.</li>
                <li>Promote information exchange and coordination through regular meetings and communication platforms.</li>

            <h4>Importance</h4>
            <p>This collaboration fosters the cross-pollination of knowledge, stimulates innovative thinking, and provides students with practical experience.</p>
            <h4>Success Stories</h4>
            <p>The "Open Courseware" project by MIT, in collaboration with multiple universities, has pushed for open sharing of educational resources, promoting global educational innovation.</p>
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intellectual Property Issues</strong>: Disputes might arise over the ownership and distribution of research outcomes.</li>
                <li><strong>Academic Cultural Differences</strong>: Different academic traditions and research methodologies might differ.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Solutions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Sign clear collaboration agreements in advance to define intellectual property rights distribution.</li>
