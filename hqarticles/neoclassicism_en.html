            <h2>Neoclassicism: The Secret Opening of the Door to Modernity</h2>
            <p>In the long river of human civilization, classicism stands like an imposing lighthouse, guiding artists through the seas of creation. However, as the wheels of history rolled into the wave of the Enlightenment at the end of the 18th century, the birth of neoclassicism was not a simple continuation of classicism but a profound "reboot" and "reconstruction." It wears the guise of classical forms but carries within it the embryonic seeds of modernity, serving as a secret key to opening the door to modernity.</p>

            <h3>I. From "Imitation" to "Construction": The Simplification of Form and the Sublimation of Spirit</h3>
            <p>Neoclassicism, on the surface, appears to pay homage to classical art in form, but in essence, it represents a profound transition from "imitation" to "construction." David's "Oath of the Horatii" captures the precise human anatomy and symmetrical composition typical of classical sculpture, yet its true value lies in its metaphorical expression of republican spirit.</p>

            <h3>II. Modern Metaphor in Narrative: From "Classical Story" to "Modern Symbol"</h3>
            <p>David's "The Death of Marat" employs a classically rigorous composition to depict the sacrifice of a revolutionary, actually using classical language to explore the essence of modern politics. Gros's "Napoleon at the Bridge of Arcole" captures the hero in a solitary moment of contemplation on the battlefield, hinting at the modern tension between individual will and historical destiny.</p>

            <h3>III. The Reconstruction of Cultural Symbols: From "Classical Symbol" to "Modern Spirit"</h3>
            <p>In architecture, the revival of neoclassicism is most evident. The Eiffel Tower in Paris, though constructed from steel, is imbued with the symbolic meaning of a "modern goddess" due to its towering form. In sculpture, Canova's "Theseus Defeating the Centaur" transforms classical heroism into a symbol of modern strength.</p>

            <h3>IV. The Hidden Starting Point of Modernity: The Dual Nature of Neoclassicism</h3>
            <p>The charm of neoclassicism lies in its dual nature: it inherits classical traditions while exploring modern spirits. Through the simplification of classical forms, the reshaping of narratives, and the reconstruction of cultural symbols, it creates a unique artistic language that embodies classical aesthetics while brimming with modern spirit.</p>

            <p>Neoclassicism is not only a significant turning point in the history of art but also a hidden starting point of modernity. It wears the guise of classical forms but opens up new directions for the development of modern art within its internal logic.</p>
