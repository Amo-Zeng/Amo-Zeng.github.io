            <h2>Labor, Nature, and Modern Predicament: The Pathway from Marx's Alienation Theory to the Integration of Eco-Marxism</h2>
            <p>Marx's alienation theory and ecological thoughts, although formed in the context of 19th-century industrial capitalism, still powerfully explain the deep contradictions between labor and nature in today's society. With the acceleration of globalization and technological revolution, especially the rise of digital capitalism, automation, and artificial intelligence, the forms and content of labor have undergone profound changes, and ecological crises have intensified. This article attempts to integrate Marx's alienation theory, eco-Marxism, and new challenges of contemporary capitalism, exploring how to address labor alienation and ecological alienation issues in the context of digital economy, platform economy, and climate change through the fusion of Marx's thoughts, and provide theoretical guidance for building a sustainable societal model.</p>

            <h3>I. The Reemergence and Deepening of Marx's Alienation Theory in Contemporary Context</h3>
            <p>Marx's alienation theory reveals the phenomenon of workers being alienated from their products, labor process, their own capacities, and social relations during capitalist production. In the era of traditional industrial capitalism, workers were forced to mechanically repeat labor on assembly lines, losing control over their products and becoming appendages of machines. However, in the context of today's digital economy and platform economy, alienation has not disappeared but has deepened and expanded in new forms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital Era "Digital Workers" and Labor Alienation</strong>
                    <p>In modern work environments, knowledge workers such as programmers, designers, and gig workers seem to have high autonomy, but in reality, their labor processes are highly standardized and controlled by algorithms. For example, while a programmer's code is a personal creation, it often serves corporate interests, leading to a gradual indifference to their work and a loss of genuine ownership over their creations. Similarly, Uber drivers and delivery riders working in the "gig economy" may appear to have more freedom of choice, but their work is heavily dependent on algorithms and platform dispatching, with their labor outcomes covertly converted into platform data traffic and profits, increasing the sense of alienation from their labor.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Automation's Amplifying Effect</strong>
                    <p>The普及 of artificial intelligence and automation further exacerbates alienation. In manufacturing, automated equipment replaces traditional workers' positions, turning workers from direct producers into "managers" of maintenance and monitoring machines, making the labor process more abstract and alienated. In the service sector, AI applications replace many tasks with algorithms and robots, leaving human workers unable to directly feel the actual impact of their labor on society, transforming labor into a passive, meaningless process. For example, bank tellers are increasingly replaced by ATMs and mobile apps, and medical diagnostics increasingly rely on AI algorithms.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>New Forms of Alienation in the Digital Economy</strong>
                    <p>The digital economy further intensifies alienation among workers. On internet and social media platforms, users are not only consumers but also producers, with their behaviors and data being captured and utilized by platforms, converting them into corporate profits. This "prosumer" model disconnects users from their labor outcomes, turning individuals into passive data sources, losing control over their own creations. For instance, Uber drivers and freelancers working on platform markets have their labor time, location, and compensation strictly controlled by algorithms, with the production process dominated by the platform, labor outcomes converted into platform traffic and revenues, intensifying the sense of alienation from their own labor.</p>

            <h3>II. Capital Accumulation and Ecological Crisis: Contemporary Applications of Marx's Theory</h3>
            <p>Marx profoundly revealed the contradiction between the social nature of production and the private nature of ownership in capitalist society in "Capital," a contradiction that has become even more prominent in the context of contemporary capitalism's global expansion. With the continuous accumulation of capital, the organic composition of capital continues to increase, driving down profit rates and forcing capitalists to constantly seek new investment opportunities and markets, thereby accelerating the process of globalization. However, this expansive development model has also led to excessive resource exploitation, environmental destruction, and increased global inequality.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate Change and Capitalism's Infinite Growth Logic</strong>
                    <p>Climate change has become one of the most severe challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. The contradiction between capitalism's infinite growth logic and the finite carrying capacity of the Earth's ecosystem has become increasingly evident. In pursuit of short-term profits, capital continuously promotes the development of high-carbon industries, ignoring long-term ecological costs. This development model not only threatens the balance of the Earth's ecosystem but also exacerbates social inequality. The divergence between developed and developing countries in addressing climate change is essentially a manifestation of the internal distribution injustice within the global capitalist system.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Digital Capitalism and the Rise of Platform Economy</strong>
                    <p>In the era of digital capitalism, data has become a new means of production. The rise of the platform economy marks a new transformation in capitalist production methods. Major tech companies achieve precise market control through the collection and analysis of user data. This new form of capital accumulation intensifies monopoly, concentrating wealth even more. Meanwhile, the widespread application of algorithmic technology has also brought new social issues, such as changes in the employment structure and ethical controversies triggered by artificial intelligence. These issues reflect the intrinsic contradictions of capitalism in the digital age.</p>

            <h3>III. Eco-Marxism: The Integration of Labor Alienation and Ecological Alienation</h3>
            <p>Eco-Marxism inherits and develops Marx's alienation theory, proposing the concept of "ecological alienation" to analyze how capitalist production methods have led to global ecological crises. They argue that the profit-driven nature of capitalism forces capitalists to disregard ecological limits, over-exploit natural resources, and shift environmental costs to society and future generations, thereby triggering climate change, resource depletion, loss of biodiversity, and other ecological issues.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Re-examining the Relationship Between Labor and Nature</strong>
                    <p>Marx's labor theory emphasizes that labor is the basic way humans exchange material with nature and is the "objectification of human beings." In this process, humans transform nature through labor to meet their needs, while also establishing a dynamic balance with nature. However, under capitalist production methods, labor becomes alienated, leading to the alienation of human-nature relations; human transformation of nature is no longer sustainable but evolves into plunder and conquest of nature, eventually causing ecological system destruction.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pathways to Ecological Socialism</strong>
                    <p>Eco-Marxists advocate combining environmental protection with social justice, establishing an ecological socialist society to achieve sustainable development of the economy, society, and ecology. They believe that the production and consumption patterns under the capitalist system are unsustainable and must fundamentally change the existing economic structure and social system. This pathway requires us to re-examine the role of labor in human-nature relations, transform current production and consumption patterns, develop green economy, promote circular economy, and achieve sustainable resource utilization.</p>

            <h3>IV. Pathways from Labor Alienation to Ecological Alienation</h3>
            <p>Addressing labor alienation and ecological alienation issues in contemporary society requires multifaceted efforts. First, workers should enhance their organizational abilities, using collective action forms such as unions and industry associations to fight for more labor autonomy and voice. Second, governments should strengthen regulation of emerging industries, formulate fairer labor laws, ensuring workers' rights in the digital economy are protected. Additionally, businesses should take on social responsibilities, respect workers' subjectivity, design more humane work processes, enabling workers to find self-realization in their labor.</p>
            <p>On the ecological level, we need to combine environmental protection with social justice, establishing a fairer social system to ensure everyone enjoys equal environmental rights and bears corresponding environmental responsibilities. We also need to view human-nature relations with a longer-term perspective, respect natural boundaries, and leave a sustainable Earth for future generations.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Although Marx's alienation theory and ecological thoughts were formed in the 19th century, they still provide profound guidance for contemporary issues of labor alienation and ecological alienation. In the context of digital capitalism, platform economy, and climate change, alienation manifests in new forms, with workers facing more complex challenges. By analyzing the actual experiences of contemporary workers, we can see that alleviating alienation and restoring workers' subjectivity not only requires self-awareness among workers but also the collective efforts of governments, businesses, and society. Only on the basis of multi-party cooperation can we truly achieve workers' liberation, transforming labor back into a pathway for self-realization rather than the source of alienation.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the rise of eco-Marxism provides important theoretical tools for addressing global ecological crises. By integrating Marx's labor theory with ecological thoughts, we can explore a sustainable development path that respects natural boundaries and ensures social justice. This is not only a major challenge faced by contemporary society but also an important direction for future social transformation.</p>
