            <h2>Core Principles and Unique Advantages of Li-Fi Technology</h2>
            <p>Li-Fi is an innovative data transmission technology based on the visible light spectrum. It utilizes the light emitted by LED bulbs as a signal carrier, transmitting data by modulating the fluctuations in light intensity. Compared to traditional Wi-Fi technology, Li-Fi offers several significant advantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ultra-High Speed Transmission</strong>: Li-Fi's theoretical transmission rate can reach the Gbps level, far exceeding traditional wireless communication technologies, meeting the high-bandwidth demands of smart homes, smart cities, and extreme environments.</li>
                <li><strong>High Security</strong>: Since light cannot penetrate walls, Li-Fi's communication range is limited to the area covered by the light, preventing external devices from intercepting or interfering with communication data.</li>
                <li><strong>Abundant Spectrum Resources</strong>: Li-Fi uses the visible light spectrum, which has a much higher frequency range than the radio wave spectrum, avoiding the issue of spectrum congestion.</li>
                <li><strong>Strong Anti-Interference Capability</strong>: Li-Fi's optical communication method is unaffected by electromagnetic interference, providing stable connections in complex extreme environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Energy Consumption</strong>: Combining LED lighting with Li-Fi technology can serve both communication and illumination purposes, further reducing energy consumption.</li>
            </ul>
