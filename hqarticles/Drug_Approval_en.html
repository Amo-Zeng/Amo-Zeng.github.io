            <p>Against this backdrop, patient-centric approval models have emerged. These models place patients at the center of medical processes, enabling seamless connections between medical institutions, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and other parties through data sharing platforms. Patients can independently determine the usage permissions of their data, while intelligent approval processes significantly simplify the cumbersome procedures of traditional models.</p>
            <h4>4. Innovative Application Scenarios and Future Prospects</h4>
            <p>This model's application scenarios are highly innovative:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Synergistic Effects Across Institutions</strong>: Patients no longer need to repeatedly submit medical information, achieving seamless access to healthcare services and laying the foundation for telemedicine and personalized treatments.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized Insurance Customization</strong>: Insurance companies can offer precise insurance products based on patients' health data, reducing the possibility of moral hazards and adverse selection.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Dimensional Empowerment of Precision Medicine</strong>: Medical institutions can obtain comprehensive patient data for precise diagnosis and treatment, accelerating the development of personalized medicine.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although this model still faces challenges such as data security, privacy protection, and interest distribution, its potential is limitless. It not only injects new vitality into the healthcare ecosystem but also drives the process of patient empowerment and medical democratization.</p>
