            <h2>Preface</h2>
            <p>MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight, publish/subscribe-based messaging protocol designed for efficient message transmission in environments with limited bandwidth, high latency, or unreliable networks. MQTT is widely used in the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile applications, real-time messaging, and other domains.</p>
            <p>From a developer's perspective, MQTT has the following notable features:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Lightweight</strong>: Small protocol header, efficient transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>Publish/Subscribe Model</strong>: Decouples publishers and subscribers, supporting one-to-many message distribution.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Bandwidth, Low Power</strong>: Highly suitable for resource-constrained devices.</li>
                <li><strong>QoS (Quality of Service)</strong>: Offers three different levels of service quality to accommodate various application scenarios.</li>
                <li><strong>Topic Filtering</strong>: Classifies and filters messages via topics.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>1. MQTT Basics</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Overview of MQTT Protocol</h3>
            <p>The MQTT protocol is based on the TCP/IP stack and adopts a client/server architecture. The main roles include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MQTT Broker</strong>: Receives published messages from clients and distributes them to clients subscribed to the corresponding topics.</li>
                <li><strong>MQTT Client</strong>: Can be a publisher, a subscriber, or both.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.2 Publish/Subscribe Model</h3>
            <p>The core of MQTT is the publish/subscribe model. Publishers send messages to specific topics, while subscribers receive messages by subscribing to corresponding topics. Publishers and subscribers are decoupled; they do not need to communicate directly but instead use the Broker for message delivery.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Publisher</strong>: Sends messages to a topic on the Broker.</li>
                <li><strong>Subscriber</strong>: Subscribes to a topic on the Broker and receives messages matching that topic.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.3 Topics and Wildcards</h3>
            <p>MQTT organizes and filters messages through topics. A topic is a hierarchical UTF-8 string, typically separated by slashes (`/`). For example, `home/livingroom/temperature` represents sensor data from the living room temperature sensor.</p>
            <p>MQTT supports two types of wildcards:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Single-level wildcard (`+`)</strong>: Matches one level. For example, `home/+/temperature` can match `home/livingroom/temperature` or `home/bedroom/temperature`.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-level wildcard (`#`)</strong>: Matches multiple levels. For example, `home/#` can match `home/livingroom/temperature` or `home/bedroom/light/status`.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.4 QoS (Quality of Service)</h3>
            <p>MQTT provides three different levels of QoS to meet the needs of various application scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>QoS 0 (At most once)</strong>: Messages are transmitted at most once and may be lost. Suitable for scenarios with low reliability requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>QoS 1 (At least once)</strong>: Messages are transmitted at least once and may be duplicated. Suitable for scenarios requiring guaranteed delivery at least once.</li>
                <li><strong>QoS 2 (Exactly once)</strong>: Messages are transmitted exactly once, without loss or duplication. Suitable for scenarios with high reliability requirements.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.5 Retained Messages</h3>
            <p>MQTT allows publishers to set the retained message flag. A retained message is stored by the Broker and sent to new subscribers immediately upon subscribing to the topic. This is useful for new devices to quickly obtain the latest state.</p>
            <h3>1.6 Will Message</h3>
            <p>A Will Message is set by the MQTT client during connection and is automatically published by the Broker to a specified topic if the client disconnects unexpectedly. This feature can be used to notify other subscribers in case of an unexpected client disconnection.</p>

            <h2>2. Working Principles of MQTT</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Connection Establishment</h3>
            <p>When an MQTT client connects to a Broker, it sends a CONNECT packet. The CONNECT packet contains key information such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Client ID</strong>: Unique identifier of the client.</li>
                <li><strong>Username/Password</strong>: Used for authentication.</li>
                <li><strong>Clean Session</strong>: Whether to clear previous session state.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep Alive</strong>: Heartbeat interval to ensure the connection stays active.</li>
                <li><strong>Will Message</strong>: Used to publish a message if the client disconnects unexpectedly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Broker responds with a CONNACK packet to indicate whether the connection was successful.</p>
            <h3>2.2 Message Transmission</h3>
            <p>The core of MQTT message transmission is the PUBLISH packet. Publishers send messages to the Broker using PUBLISH packets, which are then forwarded by the Broker to clients subscribed to the corresponding topics.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PUBLISH Packet</strong>: Contains the topic, QoS level, message content, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>SUBSCRIBE Packet</strong>: Subscribers use SUBSCRIBE packets to subscribe to topics.</li>
                <li><strong>UNSUBSCRIBE Packet</strong>: Subscribers use UNSUBSCRIBE packets to unsubscribe from topics.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.3 Connection Maintenance</h3>
            <p>To keep the connection active, MQTT clients send PINGREQ packets within the Keep Alive interval. The Broker responds with PINGRESP packets. If the client does not send any packets within the Keep Alive time, the Broker considers the connection timed out and disconnects.</p>

            <h2>3. MQTT Application Scenarios</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Internet of Things (IoT)</h3>
            <p>MQTT is one of the preferred protocols for IoT communication. In IoT scenarios, devices are often resource-constrained and operate in unstable network environments. MQTT's lightweight design and low bandwidth consumption make it highly effective in these scenarios.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smart Home</strong>: Devices like temperature sensors, door locks, and light controllers communicate via MQTT with a central control system.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial IoT</strong>: Industrial devices use MQTT to transmit sensor data or control commands.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.2 Mobile Applications</h3>
            <p>In mobile applications, MQTT can be used for real-time message push, chat functionality, etc. Compared to traditional HTTP polling, MQTT's publish/subscribe model significantly reduces network traffic and enhances user experience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-time Chat</strong>: Users subscribe to topics to receive chat messages, while publishers push messages to corresponding topics.</li>
                <li><strong>Notification Push</strong>: Mobile apps receive push notifications, such as new message alerts or event notifications, via MQTT.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.3 Real-time Data Collection and Analysis</h3>
            <p>MQTT can be used for real-time data collection and analysis, especially in large-scale distributed systems. With MQTT, systems can efficiently collect data from various nodes and perform real-time processing and analysis.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensor Data Collection</strong>: Sensors send data to a data center via MQTT for real-time monitoring and analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time Alarm System</strong>: Triggers alarms and notifies relevant personnel via MQTT when sensor data exceeds thresholds.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>4. MQTT Development Practices</h2>
            <h3>4.1 Choosing MQTT Libraries and Brokers</h3>
            <p>Before starting MQTT development, it is essential to choose appropriate MQTT libraries and Brokers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MQTT Libraries</strong>: Popular client libraries include [Paho MQTT](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/) (supports multiple programming languages) and [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/).</li>
                <li><strong>MQTT Brokers</strong>: Common Brokers include [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/), [HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/), and [EMQX](https://www.emqx.io/).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4.2 Connecting to a Broker</h3>
            <p>The basic steps to connect to a Broker using an MQTT library are as follows:</p>
            <pre><code>import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

# Create a client instance
client = mqtt.Client()

# Set connection callback
def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
    if rc == 0:
        print("Connected successfully")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to connect, return code {rc}")

client.on_connect = on_connect

# Connect to the Broker
client.connect("broker.emqx.io", 1883, 60)

# Start loop to maintain connection
client.loop_forever()
</code></pre>
            <h3>4.3 Publishing and Subscribing</h3>
            <p>Publishing and subscribing are core operations in MQTT. Below are examples of publishing and subscribing:</p>
            <pre><code># Publish a message
def publish_message():
    client.publish("home/livingroom/temperature", payload="25.3", qos=1, retain=False)

# Subscribe to a topic
def subscribe_topic():
    client.subscribe("home/livingroom/temperature", qos=1)

# Set message callback
def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    print(f"Received message on topic '{msg.topic}': {msg.payload.decode()}")

client.on_message = on_message
</code></pre>
            <h3>4.4 Handling QoS</h3>
            <p>Choosing the appropriate QoS is crucial in practical applications. Below are examples of different QoS levels:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>QoS 0</strong>: Messages are sent without guarantees of delivery.</li>
                <li><strong>QoS 1</strong>: Messages are delivered at least once, possibly duplicated. Requires acknowledgment between PUBLISH and PUBACK.</li>
                <li><strong>QoS 2</strong>: Messages are delivered exactly once. Requires a four-step handshake (PUBLISH, PUBREC, PUBREL, PUBCOMP).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>5. MQTT Performance Optimization</h2>
            <h3>5.1 Choosing the Right QoS</h3>
            <p>When selecting QoS, it is important to balance reliability requirements with application scenarios. While QoS 2 offers the highest reliability, it also incurs the greatest communication overhead. In most IoT scenarios, QoS 1 is sufficient for most needs.</p>
            <h3>5.2 Reducing Message Size</h3>
            <p>MQTT transmission efficiency is closely related to message size. The following methods can help reduce message size:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Compressing Message Content</strong>: Compress messages before sending.</li>
                <li><strong>Simplifying Message Structure</strong>: Remove unnecessary data fields.</li>
            </ul>
