        <h2>—Exploring the "Social Immune System" Role of Authoritarianism through Functional Entropy Reduction, Meaning Construction, and Cognitive Closure</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <p>During chaotic pandemic lockdowns, people voluntarily surrender their freedom of movement. At the brink of war, societies silently tolerate the expansion of information control. In the face of ecological crises, the public eagerly awaits a "strong leader" to break the deadlock. These phenomena do not stem from a betrayal of freedom, but from a systematic human demand for <strong>certainty</strong> under specific thresholds. This article reveals how authoritarian order becomes a desired "social immune system" at societal tipping points, through three dimensions: <strong>functional entropy reduction</strong>, <strong>meaning construction</strong>, and <strong>cognitive closure</strong>. Its legitimacy does not arise from violence, but from its irreplaceable role in complex systems—deeply coupling institutional efficiency with collective psychology.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>I. Functional Legitimacy: When Social Complexity Exceeds a Critical Threshold, Authoritarianism Becomes an Inevitable "Institutional Phase Transition"</h2>
            <p>Conventional narratives attribute authoritarianism to oppression or accident, but institutional economics and complexity theory reveal deeper logic. Douglass North, in <em>Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance</em>, argued that <strong>the state is essentially a monopolist of violence that reduces transaction costs</strong>. In low-complexity societies (e.g., tribes or city-states), decentralized governance suffices to handle uncertainty. But when population size, technological levels, and interaction density cross a "critical phase transition point"—such as urbanization rates exceeding 40%, or information spreading exponentially—the transaction costs of decentralized governance surge non-linearly.</p>
            <p>At this point, authoritarian order emerges as the product of an "institutional phase transition," becoming the only viable path to reduce social entropy. It achieves systemic re-stabilization through <strong>centralized information processing</strong>, <strong>rapid decision transmission</strong>, and <strong>unified resource allocation</strong>. For example, the Tokugawa shogunate’s "sankin-kōtai" system (established in 1635) was not merely oppressive, but a sophisticated <strong>institutional entropy-reduction mechanism</strong>: daimyo (feudal lords) were required to travel annually to Edo, draining their financial resources (preventing local accumulation of rebellion capital) while placing them under central surveillance. This system maintained 260 years of peace, with no large-scale civil wars—its efficiency far surpassing that of contemporary European feudal systems.</p>
            <p>Complexity theory further shows that when a system approaches a "phase transition critical point," minor disturbances can trigger systemic collapse (e.g., financial crises, pandemic spread). At such moments, <strong>authoritarianism acts as a "negative feedback regulator"</strong>, using coercive interventions (e.g., lockdowns, price controls) to prevent the system from descending into chaos. This resembles the immune system’s "inflammatory response": short-term costs (restricted freedoms) are exchanged for long-term stability. Just as thermodynamic systems achieve global entropy reduction through local entropy increases, social systems must trade individual freedoms to preserve overall order.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>II. Meaning Legitimacy: As a Regulator of "Mimetic Desire," Authoritarianism Is the "Black Hole of Meaning" for Collective Conflict</h2>
            <p>If functional legitimacy explains "why we need it," meaning legitimacy answers "why we are willing." René Girard’s theory of "mimetic desire" posits that human desire is essentially imitative—we desire what others desire. When the chain of imitation spirals out of control, society falls into "mimetic rivalry" (e.g., status competition, resource hoarding), ultimately leading to violent conflict.</p>
            <p>At this juncture, authoritarian order channels conflict into collective worship through the <strong>priest-sacrifice mechanism</strong>. The priest (leader or regime) declares a "sacred goal" (e.g., "victory over the pandemic," "national rejuvenation") and designates a "scapegoat" (e.g., the virus, external enemies), redirecting internal contradictions toward external objects. This process mirrors religious ritual: sacrifice (individual freedoms, marginalized groups) is imbued with sacred meaning, and conflict energy is "sublimated" into loyalty to the collective.</p>
            <p>The Ottoman Empire’s "Millet System" is a classic example. The empire divided Christians, Jews, and other groups into religiously defined "millets" (communities), granting autonomy but requiring tax payment and loyalty to the Sultan. The Sultan, as "monopolist of meaning," did not interfere in internal affairs, but emerged as the "guardian of the empire" in crises (e.g., plague, war), transforming social anxiety into absolute submission to his authority. Under the Millet System, religious diversity coexisted for nearly five centuries—its stability far exceeding that of contemporaneous war-torn European regions.</p>
            <p>This mechanism is essentially a <strong>black hole of meaning</strong>: it does not produce new meaning, but absorbs the energy of social conflict, converting it into gravitational pull toward the center. When individuals lose their way in mimetic competition, authoritarianism offers a "narrative of certainty"—"Why are we suffering?" "Where are we headed?"—thereby restoring psychological order.</p>

            <h2>III. Psychological Legitimacy: Driven by Cognitive Closure Needs, Individuals Actively Seek "Heuristic Obedience"</h2>
            <p>Functional and meaning-based legitimacy must ultimately take root in individual psychology. Daniel Kahneman’s dual-process model reveals that human cognition divides into <strong>System 1 (fast, intuitive)</strong> and <strong>System 2 (slow, rational)</strong>. In crises (e.g., pandemics, war), cognitive load spikes, and System 1 dominates decision-making. At such times, individuals rely on "heuristics" for rapid judgments, and the <strong>need for cognitive closure</strong> becomes critical—people crave a "definitive answer," even if it’s wrong.</p>
            <p>Authoritarian order is precisely the "provider of cognitive closure." It satisfies the individual’s craving for certainty through <strong>simplified narratives</strong> (e.g., "lockdown = safety," "opening = danger"), <strong>symbolic authority</strong> (e.g., leader imagery, national symbols), and <strong>ritualized obedience</strong> (e.g., daily nucleic acid testing). Behavioral experiments confirm this: follow-up studies to Milgram’s obedience experiment (e.g., Burger, 2009) show that <strong>65% of participants were willing to administer potentially lethal electric shocks</strong> in ambiguous information settings, and obedience rates increased with stronger authority symbols (e.g., lab coats, institutional backgrounds). In the Stanford Prison Experiment, ordinary students rapidly internalized the "guard" role—not out of malice, but from a desire for "role certainty."</p>
            <p>More crucially, <strong>crises amplify the "positive feedback" of cognitive closure</strong>: uncertainty → anxiety → search for certainty → acceptance of simplified narratives → reinforced authority dependence. This cycle shifts individuals from "passive obedience" to "active desire." When System 2 is suppressed, System 1 misidentifies authoritarian order as the "optimal solution"—even when rational analysis reveals its high costs.</p>

            <h2>IV. The New Authoritarianism of the Digital Age: Algorithms, AI, and Social Media Reconstruct the Three Legitimacies</h2>
            <p>In the digital era, the mechanisms of authoritarian legitimacy are being reconfigured by technology, forming a more covert, personalized form of "new authoritarianism."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Functional Level</strong>: Smart cities achieve "precise entropy reduction" through data governance (e.g., health codes, travel tracking). Algorithms replace traditional bureaucracy, allocating resources in milliseconds. But the cost is that <strong>data monopolies become new tools of violence</strong>, enabling prediction and discipline of individual behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Meaning Level</strong>: Social media constructs "meaning communities" (e.g., Facebook’s closed groups, WeChat’s circles). TikTok’s algorithmic recommendations create "information cocoons," trapping users in self-reinforcing meaning loops. Platforms act as "digital priests," defining "what is correct" through content moderation and traffic distribution.</li>
                <li><strong>Psychological Level</strong>: AI recommendation systems (e.g., short videos, news feeds) satisfy cognitive closure needs through "personalized certainty." Users need not think—algorithms have already selected "what you should know." A 2023 Stanford University experiment found that users exposed to algorithmic information for over 3 hours/day showed a <strong>37% increase in cognitive closure scores</strong> and were more likely to support strong-authority policies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This creates a "gentle authoritarianism": it does not say, "You must obey," but rather, "You will naturally want to." Freedom is packaged as "choice," but the range of choices has been narrowed by algorithms. As Hartmut Rosa argues, the crisis of modernity is "the lack of meaning in an accelerated society," and technological authoritarianism quietly rebuilds the three legitimacies under the guise of "efficiency" and "convenience."</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Is Freedom Merely a Luxury We Can Afford Only When Certainty Is Absent?</h2>
            <p>We once believed freedom to be the end goal of civilization. But history repeatedly shows that when systems approach collapse, humans crave an authority that can "make sense of the world," even if imperfect. Authoritarian order is not the embodiment of oppression, but the <strong>emergency protocol of complex societies</strong>—functionally reducing entropy, meaningfully channeling conflict, and psychologically providing closure.</p>
            <p>Yet, when this protocol is extended indefinitely by technology, when "emergency" becomes the norm, have we fallen into a deeper dilemma? When algorithms think for us, platforms define values for us, and cities decide for us—are we pursuing order, or abandoning our very qualification to be "human"?</p>
            <blockquote>
                Perhaps the real challenge is not resisting authoritarianism, but <strong>rebuilding a dynamic balance between the need for certainty and the will for freedom</strong>. What we need is not more control, but richer choices in meaning; not more efficient systems, but clearer cognition.<br><br>
                After all, when the entire world becomes a meticulously designed experiment in "heuristic obedience," can we still recognize the person who once longed for freedom?<br><br>
                <strong>Is "freedom" merely a luxury we afford only when certainty is lacking?</strong><br>
                <strong>And has "order" long since become our ultimate excuse to avoid thinking?</strong>
            </blockquote>
