            <h2>Bicycles: The Beacon of Future Sustainable Transport</h2>
            <p>In the face of severe global climate change and environmental pollution challenges, bicycles, with their zero-emission and low-energy characteristics, have become the epitome of eco-friendly transport. City planners are increasingly recognizing that the proliferation of bicycles can notably reduce carbon emissions and effectively alleviate traffic congestion, enhancing road use efficiency. With the booming sharing economy, bike-sharing systems have been successfully deployed in multiple cities, offering citizens a convenient and economical means of travel, further promoting the widespread application of bicycles. These initiatives not only aid in improving urban air quality but also bring tangible convenience to citizens' daily lives.</p>
