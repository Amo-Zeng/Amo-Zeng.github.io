            <h3>The Fusion of Environmental Conservation and Technology: IoT and Bicycles</h3>
            <h4>The Rise of Smart Bicycles</h4>
            <p>With increasing environmental awareness and rapid technological development, the integration of bicycles with the Internet of Things (IoT) has given birth to smart bicycles. Equipped with sensors, GPS, and internet connectivity, smart bicycles provide real-time data like speed, distance, and heart rate, and connect with smartphone apps for navigation, route planning, and weather forecasts.</p>
            <h4>Applications and Impact</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Air Quality Monitoring:</strong> Sensors on smart bicycles can monitor urban air quality in real-time, creating pollution maps to help cyclists choose healthier routes, while also providing data support to environmental departments.</li>
                <li><strong>Road Condition Feedback:</strong> By collecting road surface data, city managers can promptly repair roads, enhancing safety and the cycling experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Traffic Flow Analysis:</strong> Bicycle traffic data helps optimize urban traffic planning, reduce congestion, and promote green travel.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Data Monitoring:</strong> Cyclists' health data not only aids in personal health management but also provides a data foundation for public health policies.</li>

            <h3>Mental Health and Cycling: A Journey of Freedom</h3>
            <p>Cycling is an effective form of aerobic exercise that prompts the brain to release dopamine and serotonin, enhancing feelings of happiness and reducing the risk of depression and anxiety. Studies show that cycling in natural environments significantly lowers the stress hormone cortisol, helping individuals enter a meditative state, regulate emotions, and improve cognitive functions.</p>
            <h4>Nature Therapy and Flow Experience</h4>
            <p>Cycling offers the chance to connect with nature and experience flow. Cyclists can escape the urban hustle, enjoy changing landscapes, and shift focus away from daily stress. This experience not only benefits mental health but also improves quality of life, attracting more people to seek inner peace through cycling.</p>
