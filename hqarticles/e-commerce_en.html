            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>E-commerce has become a significant driver of the global economy, with its market size and influence continuously expanding. According to statistics, the global e-commerce market reached nearly $5 trillion in 2022 and is projected to exceed $7 trillion by 2025. However, with the rapid growth of e-commerce, its impact on the environment and society has become increasingly significant.</p>

            <h2>Sustainability and Green Logistics</h2>
            <p>E-commerce plays a crucial role in the global green economic transformation. By reducing the need for physical stores, e-commerce decreases land use and energy consumption. Nonetheless, environmental optimization in logistics is particularly critical. Technological innovations are reshaping logistics models, with electric delivery vehicles and recyclable packaging materials reducing environmental impact.</p>
            <p>For example, Amazon announced in 2021 that it aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 and has invested billions of dollars in the development and application of green logistics technologies. Additionally, the German e-commerce giant Zalando has achieved 100% recyclable use of all its delivery packaging. These examples showcase the concrete achievements and future potential of e-commerce in green logistics.</p>

            <h2>Privacy Protection and Data Security</h2>
            <p>With the development of e-commerce, privacy protection and data security have become core challenges. E-commerce platforms face risks of privacy breaches and data misuse when collecting consumer data. Legislation such as the EU's GDPR and the US's CCPA provides protection frameworks, and technological means such as encryption and blockchain enhance data security.</p>
            <p>The博弈 and cooperative relationships between consumers, businesses, and regulators require all parties to engage in dialogue and collaboration to jointly formulate and adhere to best practices in data privacy protection.</p>

            <h2>Social Responsibility and Fair Trade</h2>
            <p>E-commerce platforms are not only hubs of economic activity but also bear the responsibility of promoting social equity and economic justice. Fair pricing mechanisms and supply chain transparency ensure consumers receive reasonable prices while safeguarding producers and suppliers.</p>
