                <p>In the current era where technological civilization sweeps across the globe, the concept of the "life cycle" has long overflowed its original biological context, extending to the processes of generation and消亡 (demise) of non-human entities such as digital identities, infrastructure, and cultural memes. They do not exist in isolation but are intertwined and reflective of each other under the mediation of technology, collectively forming a profound dialectical picture: digital identities reveal the flux of subjectivity, infrastructure imprints the will to power in materiality, and cultural memes refract the reconstruction of collective consciousness. These three dimensions, like the three modes of manifestation under what Heidegger called the "Gestell" (Enframing), point to the same core proposition amidst the interweaving of data streams, technological objects, and symbolic networks—<strong>the essence of the life cycle is, in fact, the never-ending game of power, nature, and consciousness within the field of technological civilization</strong>.</p>

                <h3>I. Digital Identity: The Algorithmic Colonization of Subjectivity and the Poetics of Micro-Resistance</h3>
                <p>Digital identities undergo a full cycle of transformation: generation, iteration, migration, and湮灭 (obliteration). From the moment of registration, the flesh-and-blood body is abstracted into a data entity, completing the initial transfer of subjectivity; the continuous intervention of algorithms reduces identity to a variable within a feedback loop, constantly modified and optimized; cross-platform migration further compresses the polyphony of humanity, turning it into a tradable, calculable data commodity; and the persistent residue after a digital identity's obliteration—the so-called "digital ghost"—further blurs the boundary between existence and nothingness, challenging the philosophical foundation of traditional views on life and death.</p>
                <p>In this process, algorithmic power advances unimpeded. As Byung-Chul Han points out in the "transparent society," the mechanism of self-exploitation transforms subjectivity into an object that can be monitored, predicted, and controlled. Users are not only "the watched" but also actively participate in this watching mechanism. Platforms and states achieve microscopic penetration of biopower through data governance. As Foucault said, power no longer represses life but "produces life." However, it is precisely within such nets of control that micro-practices against algorithms breed: the deployment of false information, the use of privacy tools, and even conscious "digital invisibility" can be seen as conscious resistance of awareness within the cracks of the system. The life cycle of a digital identity is thus a fluid site of constant negotiation and mutual construction between power and subjectivity in the river of data.</p>

                <h3>II. Infrastructure: The Material Inscription of Power and the Dialectical Revenge of Nature</h3>
                <p>Infrastructure, throughout its entire process of planning, construction, maintenance, and abandonment, continuously演绎 (enacts) a material game between power and nature. The routing of cables and layout of power grids in the planning stage延续 (extend) the political logic of colonial geography; the act of construction is like a violent implantation, embedding technological objects into the body of nature, with deep-sea ecosystems and indigenous lands becoming silent sacrifices; during maintenance and upgrades, power seizes the opportunity to further extend its control, such as smart grids enhancing efficiency while strengthening monitoring potential; and in the abandonment stage, the toxic legacy of e-waste and spatial ruins become nature's revenge in the form of "delayed backlash."</p>
                <p>The life cycle of infrastructure constitutes a typical field of what Bruno Latour calls the "actor-network": humans, technological objects, ecological environments, capital, and power interact within it, jointly shaping the social-material fate of technology. It reveals a double will inherent to modernity: on one hand, attempting to彻底征服 (completely conquer) nature through technology, yet on the other hand,不得不面对 (having to face) nature's fierce dialectical feedback in the forms of vulnerability, collapse, and pollution. And in some situations—such as the transformation of industrial rust belts into cultural landscapes, or abandoned facilities being re-appropriated by communities—we also witness the germination of a "second life": a temporary reconciliation, pointing towards the possibility of symbiosis between technological objects and nature, the retreat of power, and the articulation of ecological justice.</p>

                <h3>III. Cultural Memes: Collective Consciousness and Algorithmic Shaping in an Era of Rapid Obsolescence</h3>
                <p>The传播周期 (dissemination cycle) of cultural memes—outbreak, mutation, paradigmization, and沉寂 (quiescence)—resembles the high-speed evolution of cultural DNA in the digital environment. The outbreak phase relies on algorithmic推送 (push) to achieve viral spread; the mutation phase depends on community rewriting to embed resistant meanings; subsequently, memes are either co-opted as commercial symbols or lose their original vitality through paradigmization, eventually precipitating as digital fossils, becoming archaeological evidence of the zeitgeist.</p>
                <p>The life cycle of memes演绎 (enacts) the core paradox of digital culture: the coexistence of rapid obsolescence and regenerativity, fragmentation and totality. Platform algorithms act as the invisible hand of "cultural selection," attempting to guide collective consciousness towards standardization; while users' creative mutations, parodies, and reinterpretations maintain the openness and diversity of cultural symbols. Here, Hegel's linear progression of "Absolute Spirit" gives way to Deleuze's "rhizomatic becoming." Culture is no longer sedimented classics but a flowing web of meaning. Memes thus become a phenomenon of consciousness mediated by technology: they are both pushed by algorithms and reshaped by human intent; they are both a medium of power and a vehicle for resistance.</p>

                <h3>IV. The Triadic Dialectic: The Entangled Network of Data, Power, and Technological Mediation</h3>
                <p>These three types of life cycles are not isolated from each other but are tightly intertwined within the underlying structure of technological civilization:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shared Substrate of Data Flow</strong>: Identity data relies on infrastructure for transmission and storage, while simultaneously constituting the raw material for meme dissemination; interaction data from memes feeds back into identity modeling, driving algorithm iteration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Domain Operation of Power Structures</strong>: Capital and the state control data flow through infrastructure, regulating both identity and memes through algorithmic rules; meanwhile, identity's anti-algorithmic behaviors and memes' subcultural rewriting continuously deconstruct power at the底层 (grassroots/underlying) level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ontological Turn of Technological Mediation</strong>: Technology is no longer an external tool but a constitutive environment and order. It simultaneously mediates subjective cognition, material configuration, and cultural expression, becoming an ontological force that reshapes the essence of life.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Conclusion: Between the Logic of Control and the Possibility of Symbiosis</h3>
                <p>The life cycle in technological civilization ultimately reveals the eternal game of three forces—power, nature, and consciousness—within technological media. Power attempts to achieve comprehensive control over life forms through technology—datafying identity, colonizing infrastructure, institutionalizing cultural memes; nature executes dialectical revenge through backlash, collapse, and ecological debt; and human consciousness—whether manifested as individual awareness, community governance, or cultural creation—始终寻找 (constantly seeks) agency and freedom within the fissures.</p>
                <p>There is no ultimate victor in this game, only constantly shifting temporary balances. As Heidegger warned, the essence of technology is not the technological object itself, but the mode of being it frames. Therefore, the true way out for civilization lies not in abandoning technology, but in reflecting on its enframing essence and重建 (rebuilding) its ethical foundation. We need to attempt to turn technological mediation from a "logic of control" to a "logic of symbiosis": allowing digital identities to regain narrative authority, letting infrastructure carry ecological justice, enabling cultural memes to retain creative vitality. Only in this way can we, amidst the dialectical conflicts of power, nature, and consciousness, safeguard the dignity, diversity, and flourishing of every life—whether human or non-human.</p>
