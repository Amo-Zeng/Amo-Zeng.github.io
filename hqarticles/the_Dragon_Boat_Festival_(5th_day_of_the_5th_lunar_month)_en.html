            <h3>Harmonious Coexistence of Tradition and Modernity: A New Dragon Boat Festival of Cross-Border Integration</h3>
            <p>In the fast-paced modern society, traditional elements of the Dragon Boat Festival such as the warm fragrance of mugwort, the refreshing scent of calamus, and the deliciousness of rice dumplings still provide people with a tranquil harbor. However, with the progress of the times, the Dragon Boat Festival is no longer merely a traditional festival commemorating Qu Yuan's drowning and hanging mugwort to ward off evil and disease; it is gradually evolving into a stage where creativity and culture collide, infusing it with new vitality and vigor through cross-border integration.</p>
            <p><strong>The emergence of "Internet celebrity zongzi" is a product of the collision between tradition and modernity.</strong> Innovative zongzi such as coffee zongzi and ice cream zongzi not only bring unprecedented taste experiences but also offer young people a new understanding of tradition. These novel zongzi are not only a feast for the taste buds but also a manifestation of cultural innovation, becoming a highlight of the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
            <p><strong>The combination of Hanfu and Cosplay injects more modern elements into the Dragon Boat Festival.</strong> During the festival, hosting Hanfu parades and Cosplay-themed activities allows people to experience the beauty of traditional Chinese clothing up close and fosters interactions among participants, encouraging more young people to understand and appreciate Hanfu culture. Such events not only enrich the festival's forms but also make traditional culture shine anew in modern society.</p>

            <h3>Emotional and Cultural Inheritance: The Continuation of Personal Memories</h3>
            <p>The Dragon Boat Festival is not only the inheritance of traditional culture but also the continuation of unique memories in everyone's heart. Whether it's learning to wrap zongzi with elders in childhood or the excitement of watching dragon boat races by the riverside as an adult, everyone has their own stories about the Dragon Boat Festival. These precious memories serve not only as emotional寄托 but also as an important carrier of cultural heritage.</p>
            <p><strong>Documenting memories is crucial for inheriting Dragon Boat Festival culture.</strong> By delving into the folk, interviewing people of different ages, and recording their stories related to the Dragon Boat Festival, we can create visual materials or books to preserve the tradition and emotion that are fading away. The power of images and words can transcend time and space, solidifying memories and enabling future generations to understand and feel the essence of the Dragon Boat Festival culture.</p>
            <p><strong>The rise of social media provides a more convenient platform for sharing and inheriting Dragon Boat Festival memories.</strong> Everyone can share their favorite traditions, special snacks, or the wonderful moments spent with family on social media. These shares can help more people experience the atmosphere of the festival and evoke interest and respect for this traditional event. The interactions and discussions on social media can also promote cultural exchanges and integration, strengthening community cohesion.</p>
            <p><strong>Offline activities are equally important for inheriting Dragon Boat Festival memories.</strong> Organizing activities such as memoir writing and oral history not only allows participants to relive their own Dragon Boat Festival memories but also creates a richer cultural record through collective creation and exchange. These activities can be initiated by communities, schools, or cultural institutions, attracting participants of all ages and raising awareness of the importance of protecting and inheriting intangible cultural heritage.</p>
