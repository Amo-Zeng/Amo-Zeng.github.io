            <h3>History and Development</h3>
            <p>The origins of Chebyshev polynomials can be traced back to the mid-19th century when Chebyshev first proposed these polynomials to solve the problem of optimal uniform approximation of functions. These polynomials quickly attracted academic attention due to their significant advantage in minimizing approximation errors. Over time, Chebyshev's student Andrey Markov, along with other mathematicians like Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Karl Weierstrass, further developed the theory and applications of these polynomials, securing their place not only in numerical analysis and probability theory but also in fields like physics, engineering, and computer science.</p>
