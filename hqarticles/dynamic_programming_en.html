            <h2>Multi-Dimensional Optimization and Application of Dynamic Programming</h2>
            <p>Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant calculations. In modern computational science, dynamic programming not only intersects with convex optimization theory but also closely integrates with machine learning, distributed computing, and quantum computing. This article will explore the theory and applications of dynamic programming in these intersecting fields, revealing its deep mathematical structure and strategies for enhancing computational efficiency.</p>
