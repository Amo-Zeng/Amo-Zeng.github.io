**Translation to English:**

Hello! The term "数甲 (Shu Jia)" you mentioned could have multiple interpretations. To assist you better, please clarify the following:

1. **If referring to numeral systems in Oracle Bone Script**:  
   The Oracle Bone Inscriptions (Shang Dynasty texts) contain a complete numerical system, including **digits 1-10** (e.g., 一, 二, 三, 五, 七) and **place values** like 十 (ten), 百 (hundred), 千 (thousand), and 万 (ten thousand). For example:
   - "三万四千六百五" (34,650) is directly represented by combining characters.
   - Special numbers like "〇" (zero) are absent, likely due to practical limitations on bone carvings.

   Specify the field (e.g., number theory, sequences, symbolic notation) for a targeted explanation.

3. **If a typo or other context**:  
   Provide additional details, such as your research topic or specific questions.
