                <p>Since its establishment in the mid-20th century, the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) has become the undisputed "gold standard of science" in medicine and public policy. Its core principles—randomization and blinding—are seen as the essential path to causal truth. However, when we examine RCTs through a broader interdisciplinary lens, we find that this seemingly neutral "methodological tool" is deeply embedded in a complex network of historical construction, power structures, and mechanisms of human behavior.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>I. Historical-Philosophical Dimension: Randomness as the Ritualized Construction of a Modernist Faith</h3>
                <p>The authority of the RCT was not naturally bestowed but is the result of historical evolution. In the early 20th century, "randomization" was still a marginal statistical concept, used only in Fisher's agricultural experiments to control for soil heterogeneity. Yet, when this method was successfully applied in the 1948 British streptomycin trial for tuberculosis, randomization leaped from a <strong>technical tool</strong> to a <strong>symbol of scientific legitimacy</strong>.</p>
                <p>This transformation was not a natural victory of methodology but an epistemological "construction of faith." As philosopher Ian Hacking stated, randomization is essentially the "institutional taming of the unknown"—since humans cannot control all confounding factors, they transform uncontrollability into manageable probabilistic noise through random allocation. What we trust is not the result itself but the "unbiasedness" of the process: random draws, double-blinding, procedural transparency—these ritualistic procedures endow medical knowledge with an <strong>institutionalized legitimacy</strong>.</p>

                <h3>II. Sociological Dimension: Structural Power and Group Justice Dilemmas in RCTs</h3>
                <p>Beneath the表象 of "scientific objectivity" in RCTs lurks a deep ethical crisis: they may systematically exclude or exploit vulnerable populations, even justifying injustice in the name of "science."</p>
                <p>In public policy experiments, RCTs often rely on collaboration with government agencies and community organizations, a process that inadvertently replicates existing power structures. Vulnerable groups—such as low-income families, ethnic minorities, and educationally marginalized populations—are often excluded for "operational convenience" or "data purity." For example, in an RCT on rural education in India, higher-caste villages were more likely to be selected for the experimental group, while lower-caste communities were excluded, rendering the findings inapplicable to the groups most in need of help.</p>
                <p>Traditional ethical review focuses on individual informed consent and risk minimization but neglects <strong>structural inequalities</strong>. Vulnerable individuals might passively accept unfair arrangements under the表象 of "voluntary consent." Therefore, the concept of "<strong>just randomization</strong>" must be introduced: before random allocation, a <strong>power structure audit</strong> should be conducted to identify the power dynamics and interests of all parties involved; <strong>differentiated randomization designs</strong> should be employed (e.g., setting higher allocation probabilities for the most impoverished groups); and <strong>justice compensation mechanisms</strong> should be established to ensure delayed intervention for the control group post-trial.</p>

                <h3>III. Behavioral Science Dimension: The Distortion of Human Response Mechanisms by Blinding Designs</h3>
                <p>Another core pillar of RCTs—blinding, especially double-blinding—faces profound challenges from behavioral psychology. It is built on a "stimulus-response" model, treating humans as passive responding entities and ignoring the complexity of human cognition.</p>
                <p>The placebo effect is not merely psychological suggestion but involves expectancy mechanisms, classical conditioning, and the activation of neural reward systems. In antidepressant RCTs, placebo response rates are as high as 30-40%, leading many trials to fail to show drug-placebo differences. Double-blinding mixes these psycho-biological responses into the placebo group without parsing their mechanisms, ultimately underestimating the drug's effect in real clinical practice—because clinical practice lacks the highly standardized "placebo context" of RCTs.</p>
                <p>Therefore, a behavioral shift in trial paradigms must be promoted, constructing a <strong>dynamic adaptive trial design</strong>: introducing behavioral pilot tests to identify key cognitive biases; integrating psychological variables (e.g., expectation levels, trust) as moderating factors; employing contextualized informed consent, turning the consent process into a data collection phase; and using partial or open designs for high-risk bias groups.</p>

                <h3>IV. Integrated Critique: The Triple Dilemma and Common Challenge of RCTs</h3>
                <p>The above three perspectives reveal the <strong>triple dilemma</strong> of RCTs:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Historical Constructiveness Dilemma</strong>: Randomization is mythologized as a scientific faith, ignoring its context-dependency and replaceability;</li>
                    <li><strong>Power Structural Dilemma</strong>: RCTs replicate and solidify social inequalities in implementation, with ethical frameworks lagging behind methodological innovation;</li>
                    <li><strong>Behavioral Complexity Dilemma</strong>: Blinding designs suppress natural human response mechanisms, leading to distorted causal inference.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>All three point to a core issue: <strong>the pursuit of "methodological purity" in RCTs comes at the cost of ecological validity, social justice, and cognitive authenticity</strong>. It attempts to control complexity through formal procedures (randomization, blinding) but excludes real-world dimensions like history, power, and behavior as "noise."</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>V. Future Pathways: Towards an Integrated Paradigm of "Contextualized RCTs"</h3>
                <p>We urgently need a new RCT paradigm—the <strong>Contextualized RCT</strong>, which argues that RCTs should simultaneously address historical constructiveness, power structures, and behavioral complexity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Historical Dimension</strong>: Explicitly state the historical background and symbolic meaning of randomization in trial design, avoiding methodological dogmatism;</li>
                    <li><strong>Power Dimension</strong>: Incorporate "just randomization" into ethical review, requiring researchers to conduct power structure audits and commit to justice compensation;</li>
                    <li><strong>Behavioral Dimension</strong>: Integrate behavioral pilot tests and response modeling to identify key cognitive biases and optimize blinding designs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the age of artificial intelligence, this transformation is more feasible. AI can assist in <strong>modeling power relations</strong> to identify structural inequalities in trials; optimize informed consent frameworks and blinding strategies through <strong>behavioral simulation and prediction</strong>; and even complement RCTs by combining machine learning causal inference methods (e.g., counterfactual prediction, heterogeneous treatment effect estimation).</p>

            <section class="conclusion">
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>RCTs should neither be deified nor discarded. They are a mirror, reflecting the limitations and possibilities of science in a complex world. Only by reconstructing their boundaries through interdisciplinary critique can we move beyond methodology towards true epistemic justice.</p>
