            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Environmental justice and environmental governance are crucial topics for global sustainable development. Their implications extend beyond current environmental protection and equity distribution, deeply rooted in historical accumulation, present predicaments, and future challenges. With the rapid technological advancements and the rise of non-state actors (NSAs), the landscape of environmental governance is undergoing profound changes. This article will explore the temporal and spatial interplay of environmental justice from historical, present, and future dimensions, analyze the evolving role of non-state actors in environmental governance, and discuss new challenges in technology empowerment, risks, and governance, ultimately proposing a multi-stakeholder environmental governance system.</p>

            <h2>I. Temporal Dimensions of Environmental Justice: Interplay of History, Present, and Future</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Historical Dimension: The Dual Shackles of Colonialism and Industrialization</h3>
            <p>The historical dimension of environmental justice is deeply rooted in the processes of colonialism and industrialization. During the colonial era, Western powers laid the foundation for environmental injustice through the plunder of global resources and environmental destruction. The colonized countries were forced to become resource extraction sites, providing cheap raw materials and labor, while Western nations externalized the pollution and environmental costs of industrialization to these regions.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Present Dimension: Global and Local Environmental Equity Disparities</h3>
            <p>On the spatial scale, the manifestations of environmental justice vary by region. At the global level, environmental justice is primarily reflected in the unequal distribution of environmental rights and interests between developed and developing countries. At the local level, environmental justice becomes more complex, with particularly striking disparities in environmental rights and interests between urban and rural areas.</p>
            <h3>1.3 Future Dimension: Climate Change and Intergenerational Environmental Justice</h3>
            <p>Global environmental issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss pose severe challenges to environmental justice for future generations. The impacts of climate change are not evenly distributed, with developing countries and vulnerable populations suffering the most severe consequences.</p>

            <h2>II. The Evolving Role of Non-State Actors in Environmental Governance: From "Outsiders" to "Co-Governors"</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Role Evolution: From "Outsiders" to "Insiders"</h3>
            <p>For a long time, environmental governance was deemed the exclusive domain of national governments, while non-state actors (NSAs) were regarded as auxiliary policy executors or protesters. However, the exacerbation of global environmental crises and the emergence of governance dilemmas are prompting a reevaluation of this traditional perception.</p>
            <h3>2.2 Multi-Stakeholder Participation: Building an Inclusive Environmental Governance System</h3>
            <p>The transformation of NSAs' roles provides an opportunity to build a more inclusive and diverse environmental governance system. Traditional environmental governance systems often center on governments, neglecting the participation and诉求 of various sectors of society.</p>
            <h3>2.3 Empowerment through Digital Technology and Social Media</h3>
            <p>Digital technology, social media, and other emerging forces are reshaping the organizational forms, mobilization methods, and influence of NSAs, providing new tools and platforms for their participation in environmental governance.</p>

            <h2>III. Technological Governance: Dual Challenges of Environmental Politics and Technological Advancement</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Technological Empowerment: The Rise of Citizens and Environmental Organizations</h3>
            <p>Technological advancements have provided citizens and environmental organizations with unprecedented environmental rights to information, participation, and oversight. Through technologies such as big data, the Internet of Things, and social media, citizens can acquire environmental information in real-time, participate in environmental decision-making, and oversee government and corporate actions.</p>
            <h3>3.2 Technological Risks: The Double-Edged Sword of Innovation</h3>
            <p>While technological innovation offers new possibilities for environmental protection, it also brings potential environmental and social risks. Applications of technologies such as artificial intelligence and gene editing may have unforeseen impacts on ecosystems.</p>
            <h3>3.3 Technological Governance: Balancing Development and Protection</h3>
            <p>Facing the opportunities and challenges brought by technological progress, constructing an effective technological governance framework has become an urgent priority. Technological governance needs to balance the relationship between technological development and environmental protection, avoiding technological monopolies and environmental injustice.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>IV. Building a Multi-Stakeholder Environmental Governance System</h2>
            <p>The future of environmental governance will no longer be a solo act but a symphony of multi-stakeholder participation. NSAs will evolve from demonstrators to co-governors, jointly composing a new chapter in environmental governance with governments, enterprises, and social organizations.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The temporal dimensions of environmental justice reveal the complexity and urgency of this issue. Historical environmental injustices, accumulated through colonialism and industrialization, continue to affect global environmental governance; present environmental equity disparities exist at global, national, and local levels, especially between urban and rural areas; future environmental justice must ensure intergenerational fairness while addressing climate change and biodiversity loss. The evolving roles of non-state actors and technological advancements offer new opportunities and challenges for environmental governance. Only through historical reflection, present action, and future planning can we truly build a sustainable and equitable environmental future.</p>
