            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the context of today's globalization and digitalization, multinational corporations (MNCs), social media, and local governments play crucial roles in global environmental governance. Their global supply chains, lobbying activities, information dissemination, and policy innovations have profound impacts on environmental policies. This article will explore the roles of these entities in environmental politics from various angles, including the impact of their global supply chains and lobbying activities on environmental policies, the role of social media in environmental politics, and the leadership of local governments in environmental policy innovation.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Global Supply Chains of Multinational Corporations and Environmental Policies</h3>
            <p>The global supply chains of multinational corporations span the world, encompassing every link from raw material procurement to final product sales. The complexity and breadth of these supply chains give multinational corporations significant influence over environmental policies. Firstly, through their supply chain management, multinational corporations can directly impact the utilization of global resources and pollution levels. For example, by adopting sustainable procurement policies, multinational corporations can reduce their negative environmental impact. Additionally, multinational corporations can use their market power to drive suppliers to adopt more environmentally friendly production methods.</p>
            <p>However, the supply chains of multinational corporations also present environmental challenges. For instance, the procurement activities of multinational corporations can lead to the overexploitation of natural resources and the destruction of ecosystems. Moreover, the globalized production models of multinational corporations can increase carbon footprints, exacerbating climate change issues. Therefore, the role of multinational corporations in environmental policies is a double-edged sword; they can promote environmental protection through proactive supply chain management and lobbying activities, but they can also exacerbate environmental problems through poor management and lobbying.</p>

            <h3>Lobbying Activities of Multinational Corporations and Environmental Policies</h3>
            <p>The lobbying activities of multinational corporations are an important way for them to influence environmental policies. Through lobbying, multinational corporations can directly influence the formulation of environmental policies at both the national and international levels. For example, multinational corporations can lobby for stricter environmental regulations to promote environmental protection. However, their lobbying activities can also lead to the relaxation of environmental policies. For instance, multinational corporations may lobby against stricter environmental regulations to reduce their production costs and legal risks.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the lobbying activities of multinational corporations can indirectly influence environmental policies by shaping public opinion. For example, multinational corporations can use advertising and media campaigns to enhance their environmental image, thereby influencing the public's perception and attitudes towards environmental issues. This indirect influence can further drive or hinder the formulation and implementation of environmental policies.</p>

            <h3>How Does Social Media Shape Public Perception and Action on Environmental Issues?</h3>
            <p>Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram play a crucial role in shaping public perception of environmental issues. Through real-time updates and wide dissemination, these platforms can quickly bring environmental issues to the forefront of public attention. For example, the Amazon rainforest fires in 2019 were rapidly spread through social media, sparking global attention and discussion.</p>
            <p>Additionally, social media provides a platform for public engagement in environmental actions. Through online petitions, virtual gatherings, and social media campaigns, the public can more easily participate in environmental protection actions. For example, the #ClimateAction and #FridaysForFuture hashtags have been widely shared on social media, encouraging people to take action, reduce carbon footprints, and support environmental policies.</p>

            <h3>How Do Environmental Activists and Organizations Use Social Media to Drive Policy Change?</h3>
            <p>Environmental activists and organizations use social media in various ways to drive policy change. Firstly, they can use social media for information dissemination and education, enhancing public awareness and understanding of environmental issues. For example, Greta Thunberg shares her environmental advocacy and activities on Twitter and Instagram, attracting a large following and support.</p>
            <p>Secondly, social media provides a platform for environmental organizations to organize and mobilize the public. Through online petitions and social media campaigns, environmental organizations can quickly gather supporters, exerting strong public pressure to compel governments and businesses to adopt environmental measures. For example, Greenpeace has successfully driven some countries and companies to adopt stricter environmental policies through several online petition campaigns.</p>

            <h3>How Does Misinformation and Disinformation on Social Media Affect Environmental Politics?</h3>
            <p>Although social media plays a significant role in driving environmental politics, misinformation and disinformation can have adverse effects. The spread of false information can mislead the public, weakening their understanding and willingness to act on environmental issues. For example, some climate change denial misinformation has been widely spread on social media, leading some members of the public to doubt the severity of climate change.</p>
            <p>To address the challenge of misinformation, environmental activists and organizations need to strengthen information verification and debunking false information. For example, Climate Feedback is an organization of scientists dedicated to verifying and debunking misinformation about climate change on social media. Additionally, social media platforms need to strengthen the monitoring and combating of false information to ensure the authenticity and reliability of information.</p>

            <h3>Local Governments Driving Environmental Policy Innovation in the Absence of National and International Action</h3>
            <p>The efforts of local governments in environmental policy innovation are often a response to the lack of action at the national and international levels. For example, after the United States announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in 2017, many U.S. cities and states declared their commitment to the agreement's emission reduction targets. These local governments have implemented and enforced strict environmental regulations, promoted the development of renewable energy, and encouraged low-carbon travel through public transportation and bike lanes.</p>
            <p>Additionally, local governments are using innovative financial tools and incentive mechanisms to drive environmental protection. For example, New York City has issued green bonds to raise funds for environmentally friendly infrastructure projects. These innovations not only promote environmental protection but also stimulate economic growth and job creation.</p>

            <h3>Best Practices of Cities and Local Governments in Addressing Climate Change and Environmental Protection</h3>
            <p>The best practices of cities and local governments in addressing climate change and environmental protection typically include the following aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Promotion of Renewable Energy:</strong> Many cities support the development of solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources through legislation and policies. For example, Copenhagen, Denmark, plans to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025 through large-scale investments in wind and solar energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Green Transportation:</strong> Cities develop public transportation, bike lanes, and pedestrian paths to reduce car usage. For example, Paris has significantly reduced urban transportation carbon emissions by expanding its public transportation network and building bike lanes.</li>
                <li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> Cities implement waste sorting and recycling policies to reduce waste disposal and incineration. For example, Kobe, Japan, has achieved efficient waste management through strict waste sorting and recycling policies.</li>
                <li><strong>Green Spaces:</strong> Cities increase parks and green areas to improve the urban environment. For example, Singapore has significantly increased its green areas through the "Green City" plan, enhancing the quality of life for residents.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Local Governments Enhancing Their Influence in Environmental Politics Through Cross-Regional Cooperation and Network Building</h3>
            <p>Local governments can significantly enhance their influence in environmental politics through cross-regional cooperation and network building. For example, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group is a network of over 80 global cities committed to jointly addressing climate change. These cities share best practices, technologies, and resources to collectively drive the implementation of environmental protection policies.</p>
            <p>Additionally, local governments collaborate with businesses and non-governmental organizations to drive environmental protection. For example, many cities partner with businesses to promote green buildings and renewable energy projects. These collaborations not only promote environmental protection but also drive economic development and technological innovation.</p>
