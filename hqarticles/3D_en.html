            <h3>Revolution of 3D Technology in the Field of Mental Health</h3>
            <p>With the increasing societal focus on mental health, 3D technology exhibits unprecedented application potential in this area. Particularly in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), phobias, and cognitive behavioral therapy, 3D virtual reality (VR) technology creates a safe and controlled therapeutic environment for patients. For example, PTSD patients can gradually face and adapt to traumatic scenarios in a simulated environment using 3D VR technology, without the psychological stress of the real world. Additionally, 3D technology significantly enhances the interactivity and immersion of cognitive behavioral therapy, making the treatment process more vivid and effective.</p>
