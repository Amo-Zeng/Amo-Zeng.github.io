            <h3>The Role of Combustible Ice in Global Energy Strategy</h3>
            <p>Due to its <strong>vast reserves</strong> and <strong>clean properties</strong>, combustible ice plays a pivotal role in diversifying global energy supply. As an alternative energy source, it not only reduces dependency on traditional fossil fuels, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, but also enhances national energy security and reduces reliance on energy imports from specific regions. Economically, the development of combustible ice has spurred technological innovation, created job opportunities, and could become a new growth point. However, its development also faces technical challenges, environmental risks, and high economic costs. Therefore, <strong>international cooperation</strong> is crucial, including technology sharing, setting environmental protection standards, resource sharing, and establishing legal frameworks.</p>

            <h3>Balancing Ecosystem Services with Combustible Ice Extraction</h3>
            <p>The extraction of combustible ice has various negative impacts on marine ecosystems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Disturbance</strong>: Extraction activities directly disrupt the seafloor topography, leading to the loss of marine habitats.</li>
                <li><strong>Chemical Pollution</strong>: The release of methane and chemical additives alters the chemical environment of seawater, affecting marine life.</li>
                <li><strong>Temperature Changes</strong>: Changes in temperature gradients in deep-sea environments might destabilize ecosystems.</li>
                <li><strong>Noise Pollution</strong>: Disrupts marine life that relies on sound for communication.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In response, several ecological compensation and restoration measures have been proposed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Using Thermal Energy to Restore Biodiversity</strong>: Utilizing the thermal energy from extraction processes to create suitable marine environments, promoting the growth of corals and other organisms.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Engineering</strong>: Installing artificial reefs and restoring seabed vegetation to provide new habitats and stabilize seabed sediments.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Compensation</strong>: Establishing marine protected areas and ecological compensation funds for ecosystem recovery and research.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Assessment</strong>: Setting up long-term ecological monitoring systems and conducting environmental impact assessments.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These measures aim to <strong>balance economic development with environmental protection</strong>, achieving sustainable extraction strategies. Further enhancements can be made through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-time Monitoring</strong>: Using advanced sensors and monitoring equipment to observe the ecological impacts in real time.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Compensation Mechanisms</strong>: Establishing effective compensation mechanisms to ensure ecological recovery in affected areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Engagement</strong>: Encouraging public participation in environmental conservation and raising environmental awareness.</li>
            </ul>
