            <h3>1. From "Scaffolding" to "Full-Stack Tool": The Mission Upgrade of Node.js</h3>
            <h4>Early Positioning: The "Backyard" for Front-End Engineers</h4>
            <p>Initially, Node.js was regarded as the "backyard" for front-end engineers, primarily used for writing simple scripts and tools:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Build Tools</strong>: Such as Webpack, Gulp, to enhance front-end engineering efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>CLI Tools</strong>: Such as Vue CLI, create-react-app, to simplify the front-end development process.</li>
                <li><strong>Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</strong>: Leveraging Node.js's ability to run JavaScript, achieving more efficient page loading and SEO optimization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, these application scenarios were mostly limited to auxiliary tools for front-end development, and Node.js did not truly touch the core areas of back-end development.</p>

            <h4>Role Transformation: Empowering Front-End Engineers to Step into Back-End Development</h4>
            <p>With the deepening of front-end engineering, the tasks required by front-end engineers have become increasingly complex:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Management</strong>: Need to interact with back-end APIs, handle complex data structures and business logic.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Optimization</strong>: Optimize page loading speed and rendering performance to enhance user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Security</strong>: Prevent common web attacks and ensure user data security.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These tasks exceed the traditional scope of front-end development, prompting front-end engineers to acquire more back-end skills. As a language that can handle both front-end and back-end development, Node.js naturally became the best choice for front-end engineers to enter the back-end field.</p>

            <h4>Full-Stack Development: The Core Advantages of Node.js</h4>
            <p>Node.js can become a powerful tool for full-stack development, thanks to the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Isomorphic Advantage</strong>: Using the same language on both front-end and back-end reduces development and maintenance costs and improves code reusability.</li>
                <li><strong>Event-Driven, Non-Blocking I/O Model</strong>: Efficiently handles high-concurrency requests, suitable for building real-time applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Rich Ecosystem</strong>: npm has a vast number of open-source modules covering everything from database operations to API gateways.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In practical applications, Node.js is widely used for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>BFF (Backend For Frontend) Layer</strong>: Providing customized API interfaces for the front-end.</li>
                <li><strong>Microservices Architecture</strong>: Developing lightweight microservice modules.</li>
                <li><strong>Full-Stack Frameworks</strong>: Such as NestJS, Meteor, providing complete back-end solutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through these application scenarios, Node.js has achieved a remarkable transformation from a front-end auxiliary tool to a core full-stack development tool.</p>

            <h3>2. From "Single-Threaded Asynchronous Non-Blocking" to "High-Performance Event-Driven": The Technical Revolution of Node.js</h3>
            <h4>Traditional Perspective: Single-Threaded and Asynchronous Non-Blocking</h4>
            <p>Node.js initially gained fame for its "single-threaded asynchronous non-blocking" characteristics. This design made Node.js highly efficient in handling I/O-intensive tasks, avoiding the overhead of thread switching in traditional multi-threaded models.</p>

            <h4>Core Mechanism: Event-Driven Programming Model</h4>
            <p>However, with a deeper understanding of Node.js, we realize that it is not just a runtime environment but also a high-performance event-driven programming model. Through the event loop and callback mechanisms, Node.js frees I/O operations from the main thread, allowing developers to focus on business logic and write more efficient and concise code.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Event-Driven</strong>: All I/O operations are asynchronous and notify the main thread upon completion.</li>
                <li><strong>Callback Mechanism</strong>: Provides a simple way to handle asynchronous operations, simplifying complex logic.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimization of Event Loop</strong>: Leveraging the libuv library, Node.js achieves an efficient event-driven model across different platforms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Profound Impact: The Innovation of Programming Paradigms</h4>
            <p>Node.js's event-driven model has not only influenced the JavaScript ecosystem but also had a profound impact on other languages and frameworks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python's Twisted</strong>: Borrowed the event-driven concept from Node.js.</li>
                <li><strong>Go's Goroutines</strong>: Was partially inspired by Node.js.</li>
                <li><strong>Microservices Architecture</strong>: Achieves asynchronous communication through message queues and event buses.</li>
                <li><strong>Front-End Development</strong>: Frameworks like React and Vue have borrowed the event-driven concept, enhancing the flexibility of front-end development.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>New Paradigms of Full-Stack Development</h4>
            <p>With Node.js, developers can use the same language (JavaScript) and programming paradigm (asynchronous, event-driven) to build front-end and back-end applications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Front-End Build Tools</strong>: Webpack, Vite.</li>
                <li><strong>Front-End Frameworks</strong>: React, Vue.js.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Platform Applications</strong>: Electron.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This consistency not only reduces learning costs but also improves development efficiency.</p>

            <h4>Best Practices for Microservices Architecture</h4>
            <p>Node.js's event-driven and non-blocking I/O model makes it an ideal choice for microservices architecture.

            <h4>Limitless Possibilities for Cross-Platform Development</h4>
            <p>Node.js is not limited to web development but has expanded into the IoT and desktop application fields:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IoT</strong>: With Node-RED, developers can build efficient stream processing applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Desktop Applications</strong>: Using Electron, developers can build cross-platform desktop applications.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This cross-platform capability makes Node.js a bridge connecting different devices and platforms.</p>
