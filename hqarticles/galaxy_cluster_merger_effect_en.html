            <h2>Galaxy Cluster Mergers: A Multidimensional Probe of Cosmic Evolution</h2>
            <p>The vastness and mystery of the universe have always attracted countless scientists to explore its essence. As the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe, galaxy clusters play a crucial role in the cosmic merger process, which is not only an important component of cosmic evolution but also provides us with a unique window to unravel the deeper mysteries of the universe. The gravitational potential perturbations, changes in material distribution, and gas heating and redistribution generated during galaxy cluster mergers have profound implications for the formation and evolution of large-scale cosmic structures, while also presenting new challenges and opportunities for our cosmological measurements. This article will explore the multidimensional cosmological significance of galaxy cluster merger effects from three perspectives: baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signals, dynamic evolution and mass function reconstruction of dark matter haloes, and gas heating and redistribution of hot gas distribution.</p>

            <h3>I. Enhancement and Distortion of BAO Signals: New Challenges in Cosmological Measurements</h3>
            <p>The BAO signal originates from the interaction between baryons and photons in the early universe, forming density fluctuations akin to sound waves. These fluctuations leave characteristic scales in the material distribution, similar to "sound wave ripples," which can be observed in the current large-scale cosmic structures. The uniqueness of the BAO signal lies in its scale being closely related to cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and dark energy density, making it widely used as a "standard ruler" for measuring the history of cosmic expansion and the properties of dark energy.</p>
            <p>However, the introduction of galaxy cluster merger processes adds new complexity to this issue. Galaxy cluster mergers are one of the most violent structure formation events in the universe. When two galaxy clusters collide, their internal dark matter, gas, and stellar systems undergo complex interaction processes. This process inevitably leads to gravitational potential perturbations and changes in material distribution. First, gravitational potential perturbations cause changes in the local material density. This change not only affects the internal structure of the galaxy cluster but also generates additional density fluctuations on a large scale. These fluctuations superimpose with the BAO signal, potentially enhancing or distorting the original BAO characteristics. Second, changes in material distribution, especially the redistribution of gas components, also affect the BAO signal. During galaxy cluster mergers, collisions of gas clouds release intense energy, leading to the redistribution of hot gas. This redistribution not only changes the temperature structure of the galaxy cluster but may also generate new density fluctuations on a large scale, thereby affecting the observation of the BAO signal.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Signal Enhancement</strong>: During galaxy cluster mergers, perturbations in gravitational potential and changes in material distribution may generate additional density fluctuations on a large scale. These fluctuations superimpose with the original BAO signal, leading to an enhancement of the BAO characteristics in certain areas. This enhancement effect may cause us to overestimate the rate of cosmic expansion, thereby affecting the measurement of dark energy properties.</li>
                <li><strong>Signal Distortion</strong>: On the other hand, nonlinear effects generated during galaxy cluster mergers may cause the characteristic scale of the BAO signal to shift. This distortion effect not only affects the shape of the BAO signal but may also lead to systematic errors in our measurements of cosmological parameters. For example, if the characteristic scale of the BAO signal is elongated, we may underestimate the rate of cosmic expansion; conversely, if the characteristic scale is compressed, we may overestimate the expansion rate.</li>

            <h3>II. Dynamic Evolution and Mass Function Reconstruction of Dark Matter Haloes: A New Perspective on Large-Scale Cosmic Structures</h3>
            <p>During galaxy cluster mergers, the dynamic evolution of dark matter haloes has profound implications for the formation and evolution of large-scale cosmic structures. Traditionally, the mass function of dark matter haloes has been considered static, depending only on cosmological parameters. However, the kinetic and momentum exchange during galaxy cluster mergers leads to dynamic evolution of the mass function of dark matter haloes, presenting new challenges to existing theories of the formation and evolution of large-scale cosmic structures.</p>
            <p>Dark matter haloes are structures formed by the aggregation of dark matter in the universe, and their mass and distribution are crucial for the study of large-scale cosmic structures. In isolated galaxy clusters, the evolution of dark matter haloes is mainly influenced by internal gravitational forces, and their mass function (i.e., the number distribution of dark matter haloes of different masses) remains relatively stable over a period of time. However, when galaxy clusters merge, the situation becomes complex. During mergers, the dark matter haloes of two or more galaxy clusters collide and merge, leading to the redistribution of kinetic energy and momentum. This interaction not only changes the mass and velocity distribution of individual dark matter haloes but may also trigger the formation of new dark matter haloes or the fragmentation of existing ones. For example, in massive galaxy cluster mergers, smaller dark matter haloes may be absorbed by larger ones or torn into smaller structures due to tidal forces.</p>
            <p>To understand the dynamic evolution of the mass function of dark matter haloes during mergers, researchers need to rely on theoretical models and high-resolution numerical simulations. At the theoretical level, researchers can use statistical physics and cosmological frameworks to build models describing the evolution of the mass function of dark matter haloes. For example, by analyzing the conservation relations of kinetic energy and momentum during mergers, the evolution equation of the mass function can be derived. Additionally, considering nonlinear effects, the model needs to incorporate the complexity of gravitational interactions to more accurately describe the dynamic evolution of dark matter haloes.</p>

            <h3>III. Gas Heating Mechanisms and Redistribution of Hot Gas Distribution: A Key Factor in Galaxy Formation and Evolution</h3>
            <p>During galaxy cluster mergers, the collision and energy release of gas clouds are another core physical mechanism. These gases, mainly consisting of hydrogen and helium plasma, constitute the majority of the mass of galaxy clusters and are the main source of X-ray radiation from galaxy clusters. During galaxy cluster mergers, the collision of gas clouds releases intense energy, heating the gas to extremely high temperatures (usually between several million and several billion Kelvin) and redistributing it throughout the galaxy cluster. This process not only changes the temperature structure and X-ray radiation characteristics of the galaxy cluster but may also have profound implications for galaxy formation and evolution.</p>
            <p>During galaxy cluster mergers, gas clouds of different temperatures and densities collide, resulting in various energy release and thermalization mechanisms, including the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shock Wave Heating</strong>: When gas clouds of two galaxy clusters collide at high speed, strong shock waves are generated. The high-speed gas at the forefront of the shock wave converts its kinetic energy into thermal energy, thereby heating the surrounding gas. This shock wave heating mechanism is one of the main ways of gas heating during galaxy cluster mergers.</li>
                <li><strong>Turbulent Heating</strong>: During mergers, gas clouds undergo intense turbulent motion. Turbulence can generate small-scale kinetic energy disturbances in the gas and convert kinetic energy into thermal energy through viscous dissipation mechanisms.</li>
                <li><strong>Radiative Heating</strong>: Heated high-temperature gas emits a large amount of radiation in the X-ray band. This radiative energy can further heat the surrounding gas, especially in areas with high gas density.</li>
                <li><strong>Gravitational Heating</strong>: The release of gravitational potential energy during galaxy cluster mergers also contributes to gas heating. When the dark matter haloes of two galaxy clusters approach each other, gravitational potential energy is released and converted into the kinetic energy of the gas, which is then converted into thermal energy through shock wave or turbulent mechanisms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>IV. Conclusion: Multidimensional Cosmological Significance of Galaxy Cluster Merger Effects</h3>
            <p>Galaxy cluster merger effects provide a new research dimension for our cosmological measurements. By deeply studying the enhancement and distortion effects of galaxy cluster mergers on BAO signals, the dynamic evolution and mass function reconstruction of dark matter haloes, and the heating and redistribution of hot gas distribution, we can not only improve the accuracy of cosmological parameter measurements but also gain a more comprehensive understanding of the formation and evolution of large-scale cosmic structures. This research direction not only has important theoretical significance but also provides new challenges and opportunities for future cosmological observations.</p>
