            <h2>Galaxy Cluster Mergers: Multidimensional Probes of Cosmic Evolution and Unsolved Mysteries</h2>
            <p>Galaxy cluster mergers are among the most dynamic events in the universe, not only shaping the large-scale structure of the cosmos but also providing a unique laboratory for studying dark matter, the origins of cosmic rays, and galaxy evolution. However, the complexity of galaxy cluster mergers is far from being fully explained by a single theory, and the underlying physical mechanisms remain shrouded in mystery. This article delves into the multidimensional effects of galaxy cluster mergers from three innovative perspectives—dark matter substructures, extreme particle accelerators, and galactic metabolic disorders—revealing their profound footprints in cosmic evolution and complex dynamic processes, while also exploring potential breakthroughs for future research.</p>

            <h3>1. Dark Matter Substructure: Dynamical Relics and Unsolved Mysteries of Cosmic Chemistry</h3>
            <p>As the dominant component shaping the structure of the universe, the nature and structure of dark matter remain one of the central mysteries of modern cosmology. Traditional research methods have primarily focused on the evolution and distribution of visible matter. However, with advancements in observational technologies (e.g., JWST) and numerical simulations (e.g., IllustrisTNG), we can now trace the deep footprints of dark matter in the evolution of cosmic structures. Yet, whether the nature of dark matter aligns with the predictions of the ΛCDM model remains an unsolved mystery.</p>
            <p>During galaxy cluster mergers, dark matter substructures (e.g., dark matter subhalos) undergo stripping, perturbation, and even fusion, processes that are physically analogous to molecular collisions and dissociations in chemical reactions. Dynamical friction is a key mechanism in this process, causing dark matter subhalos to settle into the core region of the main halo or even be completely stripped. However, does this process fully align with the predictions of the ΛCDM model? Certain observational anomalies, such as discrepancies between gravitational lensing distortions and model predictions, may hint at deeper complexities in dark matter, such as self-interactions or additional degrees of freedom.</p>
            <p>Moreover, gravitational lensing provides a powerful tool for studying the distribution of dark matter. In some strong gravitational lensing systems, the bending paths of starlight do not match the expected mass distribution, and these anomalies may be dynamical relics of stripped dark matter substructures. By combining high-resolution infrared observational data from JWST with numerical simulations, we can more accurately reconstruct the spatial distribution and evolutionary history of dark matter. In the future, could these observational data reveal non-standard properties of dark matter, challenging or refining mainstream cosmological models? This will be a key focus of future research.</p>

            <h3>2. Extreme Particle Accelerators: Amplification of Primordial Magnetic Fields and Non-Thermal Radiation Bursts</h3>
            <p>Galaxy cluster mergers are not only crucial for cosmic structure formation but also serve as natural laboratories for extreme astrophysical phenomena. During mergers, immense gravitational interactions generate powerful shock waves, which amplify primordial magnetic fields from microgauss levels to microgauss levels through turbulent mechanisms, triggering non-thermal radiation bursts and offering new explanations for the origins of cosmic rays. However, does the acceleration mechanism of cosmic rays rely solely on shock waves? Are there other undiscovered physical mechanisms in the amplification of magnetic fields?</p>
            <p>The turbulent motion at the shock front is analogous to plasma turbulence experiments in laboratories, but on a cosmic scale, its energy and magnitude reach extremes. Scientists use the LOFAR low-frequency radio telescope to observe synchrotron radiation at the shock fronts of mergers, where the spectral characteristics of synchrotron radiation can reflect the strength and distribution of magnetic fields. Combined with X-ray observations (e.g., eROSITA), the spatial separation of thermal and non-thermal components can be detected, further revealing the energy distribution and particle acceleration mechanisms during mergers. However, can these observations fully explain the extreme energy distribution of cosmic rays? In the future, with the accumulation of more high-precision observational data, we may discover new mechanisms of particle acceleration or even reveal the multi-source origins of cosmic rays.</p>
            <p>This research not only provides new perspectives on the origins of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (>1 PeV) but also offers cosmic-scale references for laboratory plasma turbulence studies. However, the physical conditions in the cosmos differ significantly from those in laboratories. Can we simulate cosmic-scale turbulence processes in laboratories in the future? This will be a key focus of interdisciplinary research.</p>

            <h3>3. Galactic Metabolic Disorders: Cold Gas Stripping and Cross-Scale Feedback of Starburst Activity</h3>
            <p>The evolution of galaxies is often described as a dynamic equilibrium system, where gas accretion and star formation activities mutually regulate each other, akin to the metabolic processes of living organisms. However, when galaxies undergo merger events, this balance is disrupted by gravitational perturbations, triggering a series of cross-scale chain reactions, leading to what is termed "galactic metabolic disorders." This disorder provides a dynamic explanatory framework for understanding the "rapid quenching" mechanism of galaxies, but its specific mechanisms remain largely unresolved.</p>
            <p>Merger events first significantly perturb the distribution of cold gas in galaxies through gravitational tidal forces, disrupting the flow of cold gas. Cold gas is the primary raw material for star formation, and its stripping directly suppresses star formation activities in the outer regions of galaxies. By observing molecular gas dynamics with ALMA, we can trace the distribution and motion changes of cold gas during mergers. However, does the stripping of cold gas rely entirely on gravitational tides? Are there other mechanisms (e.g., magnetic fields or radiation fields) involved?</p>
            <p>The stripping of cold gas may also lead to its accumulation in the galactic center, triggering AGN outbursts. AGNs release enormous energy through radiation and jets, further heating or stripping the gas within the galaxy, creating a positive feedback loop. However, is the intensity and duration of AGN feedback sufficient to explain the rapid quenching of galaxies? In the future, by tracking ionized gas outflows with integral field spectrographs (e.g., MUSE), we will be able to more precisely reveal the impact of AGN feedback on galactic gas dynamics.</p>
            <p>While cold gas is being stripped, merger events may also trigger intense starburst activities in certain regions, characterized by the rapid formation of a large number of stars in a short period. Starburst activities not only consume the remaining gas but may also further heat or strip gas through supernova explosions and stellar winds, exacerbating galactic metabolic disorders. However, are the triggering conditions for starburst activities solely dependent on merger events? In the future, by constructing a three-dimensional phase diagram of "merger stage-feedback intensity," we will be able to quantify the feedback intensity at different stages of the merger process, revealing the relationships between cold gas stripping, AGN outbursts, and starburst activities.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Galaxy cluster mergers are a crucial aspect of cosmic structure formation and serve as natural laboratories for studying dark matter, the origins of cosmic rays, and galaxy evolution. By exploring the dynamical relics of dark matter substructures during mergers, we have uncovered new clues about the nature of dark matter but have also raised more unanswered questions. As extreme particle accelerators, galaxy cluster mergers significantly amplify primordial magnetic fields through turbulent mechanisms, triggering non-thermal radiation bursts and providing new explanations for the origins of cosmic rays, but their acceleration mechanisms require further exploration. The "galactic metabolic disorders" induced by mergers, by analogy with biological metabolism, reveal the complex dynamic processes in galaxy evolution and offer new perspectives for understanding the rapid quenching of galaxies, but their specific mechanisms still require in-depth study through multi-wavelength observations and numerical simulations.</p>
            <p>In the future, with further advancements in high-resolution observational technologies (e.g., JWST, ALMA, MUSE) and numerical simulations (e.g., IllustrisTNG), we will be able to gain a deeper understanding of the complex physical processes of galaxy cluster mergers, uncovering more mysteries of the universe. These studies will not only advance the field of astrophysics but may also provide new insights for other disciplines, such as plasma physics and biophysics.</p>
