            <h2>Rooted Locally, Soaring Globally: The Era Significance of Internationalization at Home</h2>
            <p>In the tide of globalization, the education sector is undergoing a profound transformation unlike any before. Traditional study abroad models send students out of their home countries, allowing them to experience diverse cultures and expand their international perspectives in foreign lands. However, with the rapid advancements in technology and the increasing frequency of international exchanges, a new educational concept—**Internationalization at Home**—is emerging and gradually becoming a significant force in reshaping the future of education.</p>

            <h3>Rooted Locally, Embracing the World: The Era Significance of Internationalization at Home</h3>
            <p>**Internationalization at Home** is not a negation of traditional study abroad models but a more inclusive and innovative supplement. It breaks the geographic constraints, enabling more students who aspire to receive international education to absorb international elements in their local environments without traveling abroad. By introducing international curricula, foreign faculty, cross-border cooperation projects, and cutting-edge technological means, Internationalization at Home constructs a virtual classroom that transcends national boundaries, allowing students to feel the global pulse and appreciate the charm of multiculturalism without leaving home.</p>
            <p>This educational model not only reflects respect for cultural diversity but also emphasizes the organic integration of international elements on the foundation of local culture, creating a unique educational ecosystem. It aims to cultivate students' **cultural dialogue abilities**, enabling them to deeply understand the essence of their own culture while appreciating and embracing the unique values of other cultures. This **intercultural competence** is an indispensable core competitiveness for 21st-century talents.</p>

            <h3>Educational Equity and Global Citizenship: The Dual Mission of Internationalization at Home</h3>
            <p>**Internationalization at Home** provides a new solution to educational equity. Traditional study abroad models often exclude many talented but financially disadvantaged students due to their high costs. In contrast, Internationalization at Home lowers the threshold for international education through technology empowerment and resource sharing, allowing more students to access high-quality educational resources equally. This transformation not only promotes the democratization of education but also lays a foundation for cultivating diverse talents with international perspectives.</p>
            <p>**Educational equity and internationalization** are not opposing concepts but mutually reinforcing and promoting. The introduction of international educational resources can effectively reduce educational disparities and enhance overall educational quality. The realization of educational equity ensures that every student can receive international education equally, thereby cultivating **global citizens** who possess both global perspectives and a sense of social responsibility, contributing to building a fairer and more inclusive world.</p>
