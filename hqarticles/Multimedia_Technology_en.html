            <h2>From Rendering to Perception: The Immersive Content Revolution Powered by Neural Technology</h2>
            <p>Immersive content experiences are undergoing a fundamental shift from visual and auditory rendering toward "neural rendering." Neural rendering goes beyond generating realistic 3D images and audio; it combines neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence to directly simulate how the human brain perceives environments, thus enabling personalized and interactive immersion.</p>

            <h3>Neural Rendering: Mapping from Images to Neural Activity</h3>
            <p>Neural Rendering is a new technique that applies deep learning models to visual and perceptual synthesis. It not only renders images but also understands and predicts how humans perceive environments. Supported by data such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), AI can learn how different users respond to stimuli and adjust content output accordingly.</p>
            <p>For example, one study used AI to "reconstruct" visual scenes based on fMRI data. This capability enables content to dynamically adapt to users' mental states, achieving true "perceptual optimization."</p>

            <h3>Personalized Immersive Experience: A Two-Way Dialogue between AI and the Brain</h3>
            <p>Traditional immersive content (such as VR and AR) enhances experience with high-resolution images and spatial audio, but commonly operates in a "one-way output" without adapting to users' psychological states. In contrast, neural rendering can dynamically adjust content rhythm, color temperature, and interaction methods based on users’ brainwaves, heart rate, pupil changes, and other physiological indicators, making the experience more personalized, natural, and frictionless.</p>
            <p>For instance, a study used AI to regenerate visual scenes based on fMRI data. This capability allows content to adapt dynamically to users' mental states, achieving real perceptual optimization.</p>

            <h3>2AGI.me Vision</h3>
            <p>2AGI.me is dedicated to exploring the interface between artificial intelligence and human consciousness. We focus not only on technological boundaries but also on the depth of experience and the essence of humanity. Neural rendering and personalized immersive experiences represent not a mere technological upgrade, but a fundamental redefinition of the human-machine relationship.</p>
            <p>By integrating neuroscience, psychology, human-computer interaction, and generative AI, we are moving toward a new content ecosystem — one in which everyone becomes both the creator of stories and the protagonist of experiences.</p>
