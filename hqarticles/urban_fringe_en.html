            <h2>Challenges and Opportunities in Urban Fringe Areas</h2>
            <p>Urban fringe areas, as transition zones between cities and nature, often face multiple challenges such as ecological degradation, loss of cultural heritage, and economic stagnation. However, the rapid advancement of modern technology provides a unique opportunity for comprehensive regeneration.</p>

            <h3>I. Integration of Ecological Restoration with Smart Technology</h3>
            <h4>1. Smart Ecological Horticulture Projects:</h4>
            <p>Ecological horticulture projects implemented in urban fringe areas can leverage smart sensors and IoT technology to optimize plant growth environments. Smart systems can monitor soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels in real-time, precisely adjusting irrigation and fertilization to enhance vegetation recovery. Additionally, drones and satellite technology are used for ecological monitoring, ensuring that ecological restoration projects are effectively implemented at both macro and micro levels.</p>
            <h4>2. Community Engagement and Technology Education:</h4>
            <p>Involving community residents in ecological restoration through smartphone apps or virtual reality (VR) technology for ecological education and participatory design. Residents can learn about the local ecosystem through these platforms, participate in the design of nature reserves and ecological horticulture projects, enhancing their sense of responsibility and belonging to the environment.</p>

            <h3>II. Innovative Strategies for Cultural Preservation</h3>
            <h4>1. Digital Preservation of Cultural Heritage:</h4>
            <p>Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and 3D scanning technology to digitally preserve cultural heritage in urban fringe areas, like ancient buildings and traditional crafts. These digital resources can be used for academic research and exhibitions, and virtual tours can attract more visitors, promoting cultural tourism economy.</p>
            <h4>2. Interactive Events Combining Culture and Technology:</h4>
            <p>By organizing events that blend technology with culture, such as smart traditional festivals, AR crafts exhibitions, traditional culture is preserved and promoted in a modern form. These events can integrate with smart city platforms to provide interactive experiences, increasing engagement from both residents and tourists.</p>

            <h3>III. Economic Regeneration and the Sharing Economy</h3>
            <h4>1. Application of Sharing Economy Models:</h4>
            <p>Urban fringe areas can activate idle resources through shared office spaces, community gardening, and cooperatives. IoT and blockchain technologies can establish more transparent and efficient resource-sharing platforms, promoting rational allocation and utilization of resources. For example, shared office spaces can integrate with smart office systems to optimize resource usage and reduce waste.</p>
            <h4>2. Role of Social Enterprises:</h4>
            <p>Social enterprises can provide employment opportunities and social services in fringe areas. With smart technology, they can optimize operational efficiency, such as providing personalized training through big data analysis to enhance employment capabilities, or using mobile health services powered by 5G and AI technology to increase service coverage and quality.</p>

            <h3>IV. Comprehensive Strategies and Policy Support</h3>
            <h4>1. Smart City Planning:</h4>
            <p>Planning for urban fringe areas requires a holistic perspective, incorporating ecological, cultural, and economic development into a unified smart city framework. This should include smart transportation systems, intelligent allocation of public services, and spaces for innovation combining culture and technology.</p>
            <h4>2. Policy and Educational Support:</h4>
            <p>Government and related institutions should provide policy support, including financial aid, technical training, and legal protection. Simultaneously, through education and promotional activities, public awareness of smart city concepts can be raised, fostering ecological consciousness and cultural pride.</p>
