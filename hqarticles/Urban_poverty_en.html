            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Urban poverty is a multidimensional and complex social phenomenon involving economic, environmental, and social layers. In the context of digital transformation, environmental pollution, and insufficient social capital, urban poor face multiple challenges. This article will explore urban poverty from three perspectives: the digital divide and economic opportunities, environmental justice and poverty, and social capital and community networks, and propose comprehensive solutions.</p>

            <h2>I. Digital Divide and Economic Opportunities</h2>
            <p>In today's highly digitalized world, the digital divide has become one of the major challenges faced by the urban poor. This divide is not only about the ownership of technological devices but also reflects significant differences in access to information, educational resources, job opportunities, and social services.</p>
            <h3>Policy Recommendations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure Investment</strong>: Governments should heavily invest in infrastructure to ensure every community has access to high-speed internet. For instance, the "Broadband Expansion Program" in the USA has expanded broadband coverage and provided free Wi-Fi hotspots, ensuring low-income families can also benefit from internet services.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Subsidies and Sharing Programs</strong>: Offer subsidies for devices and establish device-sharing centers to help low-income families acquire necessary internet equipment. Some cities like New York have implemented "One Laptop Per Family" programs to ensure each household has at least one internet-capable device.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Education and Training</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Community Training Centers</strong>: Set up free digital literacy courses in community centers, libraries, and schools, teaching basic computer usage, online safety, and digital economy knowledge.</li>
                        <li><strong>Job Training and Employment</strong>: Collaborate with tech companies to provide internships and job opportunities, helping residents enter the digital economy. Design multi-level vocational training courses for different age groups and skill levels, such as programming, data analysis, and online marketing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Digital Navigator Services</strong>: Provide one-on-one guidance for residents unfamiliar with digital technology, helping them address daily internet usage issues and improve their problem-solving capabilities.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Community Project Example</h3>
            <p><strong>"Digital Bridge" Project</strong>: In New York, nonprofit organizations work with the government to provide free internet access points and computer training courses for residents, helping them secure employment opportunities. Additionally, this project includes digital navigator services to assist residents with daily internet usage issues.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Urban poverty is a multidimensional challenge that requires comprehensive consideration from the digital divide, environmental justice, and social capital. Through implementing infrastructure investments, green building projects, community organizations, and cooperatives, we can significantly enhance economic opportunities, quality of life, and community cohesion for the urban poor. Policymakers, community leaders, and all sectors of society must work together to ensure these measures are sustainably and effectively implemented, promoting comprehensive community development, social justice, and prosperity. By enhancing social capital, promoting environmental justice, and narrowing the digital divide, we can create a fairer, more prosperous, and sustainable future.</p>
