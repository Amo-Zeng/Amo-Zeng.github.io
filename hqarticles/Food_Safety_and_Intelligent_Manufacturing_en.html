            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Food safety has always been a focal point globally, and with consumers' increasing demands for food quality, traditional food production and supply chain management are facing significant challenges. The rise of intelligent manufacturing technologies offers innovative solutions for food safety. This article will delve into the application of blockchain technology in food traceability, real-time monitoring with smart sensors and AI in food processing, and precision management in food packaging and sorting through robotics and automation, illustrating how these technologies work together to enhance transparency and safety in the food supply chain.</p>

            <h3>Application of Blockchain Technology in Food Traceability</h3>
            <p>Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable characteristics, brings unprecedented transparency and security to the food supply chain.</p>
            <h4>Core Advantages</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Blockchain records every step from raw materials to final products, making every link in the supply chain visible.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Once information is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered, effectively reducing the possibility of food fraud.</li>
                <li><strong>Traceability:</strong> Consumers can easily scan and access information about the food's journey from farm to fork, enhancing trust in food safety.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Real-World Case Studies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Walmart's Blockchain Traceability System:</strong> In collaboration with IBM, Walmart established a blockchain system for the pork supply chain from China to the US, achieving full monitoring from production to sale, enhancing supply chain transparency, and enabling rapid source tracing when issues arise.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Potential Challenges</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical Cost:</strong> The implementation of blockchain requires high initial investment and ongoing maintenance costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Standardization Issues:</strong> Currently, blockchain technology lacks uniform standards, leading to interoperability issues between different systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy Concerns:</strong> Consumers' personal information and purchasing habits might be exposed on the blockchain.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Real-Time Monitoring with Smart Sensors and AI in Food Processing</h3>
            <p>Smart sensors and AI technology are playing an increasingly critical role in food processing.</p>
            <h4>Core Functions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Monitoring:</strong> Smart sensors monitor key parameters like temperature and humidity in real-time to ensure food is processed under optimal conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Prediction:</strong> Through data analysis, AI can predict food safety risks such as microbial growth or spoilage and take preventive measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic Adjustment:</strong> Based on monitoring data, AI systems can automatically adjust production parameters to ensure food quality and safety consistency.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Real-World Case Studies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nestlé's Smart Sensor Project:</strong> On chocolate production lines, Nestlé uses smart sensors to monitor temperature and humidity in real-time, optimizing the production process and ensuring product quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Unilever's AI Risk Prediction System:</strong> Unilever uses AI to monitor ice cream production, predicting potential quality issues like melting risk, and adjusts refrigeration equipment parameters to prevent such issues.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Potential Challenges</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical Complexity:</strong> Professional knowledge is needed to install and maintain these systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> Handling large amounts of data requires robust security measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Issues:</strong> The implementation and maintenance costs of the system are relatively high.</li>
            </ul>
