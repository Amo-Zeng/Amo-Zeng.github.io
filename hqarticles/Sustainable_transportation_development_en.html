            <p>With the rapid urbanization, transportation issues have increasingly become a bottleneck hindering the development of cities. Challenges such as traffic congestion, environmental pollution, and resource waste not only reduce the efficiency of city operations but also threaten the quality of life for residents and the sustainable development of cities. Traditional transportation planning models often focus on "extending routes" but overlook the "last mile" pain point, leading to a decline in the attractiveness of public transportation and a persistently high usage rate of private cars. Meanwhile, the disconnect between transportation systems and urban ecology further exacerbates environmental problems. Against this backdrop, a revolution in urban mobility is悄然兴起, not only aiming to efficiently solve the "last mile" problem but also
