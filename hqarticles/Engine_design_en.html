            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Against the backdrop of increasing global concern over energy efficiency and environmental impact, the limitations of traditional internal combustion engine technology have become increasingly apparent. The energy losses during combustion, greenhouse gas emissions, and reliance on fossil fuels have prompted scientists and engineers to explore more efficient and environmentally friendly alternatives. This article will delve into three revolutionary directions in future engine design: breakthroughs in bionics and new materials, the integration of miniaturization and intelligence, and unconventional "non-combustion" power sources. The combination of these three areas will not only transform the design of power engines but also open up new possibilities for future vehicles and aircraft.</p>
