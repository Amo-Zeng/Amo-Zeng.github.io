            <h2>Roman Sculpture: A Brilliant Jewel in the History of Western Art</h2>
            <p>Roman sculpture, a brilliant jewel in the history of Western art, is often seen as the successor to Greek art. However, this inheritance is not a simple replication or imitation but a magnificent transformation of art. Roman artists, while absorbing the essence of Greek art, infused their own unique cultural DNA, ultimately surpassing Greek art. This process is not only reflected in the techniques and expressive power of art but also in the deep integration of sculpture with urban spaces. Through sculpture, the Roman Empire permanently inscribed the authority of rulers, the glory of the empire, and the memory of history into stone, symbolizing imperial power and culture.</p>

            <h3>From Greece to Rome: The Magnificent Transformation of Art</h3>
            <p>The rise of Roman sculpture is inseparable from the influence of Greek art. In the 3rd century BCE, with the expansion of the Roman Empire, the influence of Greek art gradually permeated Roman culture. Roman artists not only learned from Greek sculpture the idealized aesthetic principles, such as the perfect proportions of the human body, the harmonious rhythm of movement, and the idealized facial expressions but also widely borrowed the themes and expressive methods of Greek sculpture. For example, the gods, heroes, and athletes in Roman sculpture often bear distinct Greek style characteristics, and in some works, Greek originals were directly copied.</p>
            <p>However, the Romans' imitation was not a mere replication but a process of understanding the essence of Greek art through reference. This process was not only reflected on a technical level but also in the profound absorption of aesthetic concepts. While imitating Greek sculpture, Roman artists gradually mastered how to express the inner emotions and spiritual states of characters through sculpture, laying a solid foundation for their subsequent artistic innovations.</p>

            <h3>From Imitation to Transcendence: The Unique Artistic Language of Roman Sculpture</h3>
            <p>Although Roman sculpture began with the imitation of Greek art, it ultimately surpassed Greek art in themes, techniques, and social functions. Roman sculpture's themes became more diverse, not only portraying mythological heroes and gods but also extensively involving historical figures, ordinary citizens, and domestic life. Roman artists used sculpture to record the glorious history of the empire and created many realistic images, such as emperors, generals, philosophers, and citizens. This diversity of themes made Roman sculpture a more inclusive and diverse art form.</p>
            <p>Roman sculpture also surpassed Greek sculpture in social and political functions. While Greek sculpture primarily served religion and mythology, Roman sculpture was closely integrated with political power. The Roman Empire used sculpture to portray the majestic images of rulers and spread the authority and glory of the empire. For example, the bas-reliefs on triumphal arches recorded the victory exploits of generals, and the portrait sculptures of emperors displayed the divine and majestic presence of rulers. These sculptures were not only artistic expressions but also visual narratives of politics and culture, serving the ruling needs of the empire.</p>

            <h3>The Perfect Integration of Roman Sculpture with Urban Spaces</h3>
            <p>The relationship between Roman sculpture and urban spaces was inseparable; sculpture often became an extension and supplement to buildings, jointly constructing the visual narrative of Roman urban spaces. From triumphal arches to temples, from plazas to theaters, Roman sculpture enriched the expressive power of architecture with its unique artistic language,赋予了空间更深层次的意义。</p>
            <h4>Triumphal Arches and Bas-reliefs: A Visual Ode to Victory</h4>
            <p>Triumphal arches were one of the most representative buildings of the Roman Empire, often adorned with numerous bas-reliefs recording the victory exploits of generals and the glorious moments of the empire. For example, the bas-reliefs on the Arch of Titus depict the Roman army's conquest of Jerusalem, showcasing the might of the Roman military and the splendor of victory. These bas-reliefs were not only artistic expressions but also visual narratives of politics and history.</p>
            <h4>Temples and Statues: Sacred Visual Symbols</h4>
            <p>Roman temples were not only places of religious activity but also exhibition spaces for sculptural art. The entrances, colonnades, and interior spaces of temples were often decorated with numerous statues and bas-reliefs, reflecting the Romans' reverence and awe for the gods. For example, the statues of the Pantheon, with their solemn postures and intricate carvings, created a sacred and majestic atmosphere. These statues were not only symbols of religious faith but also visual expressions of Roman culture, reflecting the Romans' understanding of cosmic order and their pursuit of eternity.</p>
            <h4>Plazas and Monuments: The Spiritual Heart of the City</h4>
            <p>The public plazas of Rome were the core spaces of the city, and the sculptures and monuments in these plazas not only beautified the urban landscape but also shaped the collective memory and spiritual symbols of the city. Taking the Roman Forum as an example, the sculptures and monuments in the forum recorded the history of the empire and the achievements of heroes, becoming the visual focus of citizens and visitors. For instance, the statue and monument of Caesar, through sculptural form, showcased Caesar's greatness and immortality, becoming visual symbols of Roman imperial history. These sculptures were not only artistic decorations but also spiritual symbols of the city, reinforcing citizens' sense of belonging and loyalty to the empire.</p>

            <h3>Sculpture and the Memory of the Empire: The Eternal Visual Pursuit</h3>
            <p>Roman sculpture was not only an artistic expression but also a visual witness to history. Through sculpture, the Roman Empire permanently inscribed its historical events, heroic figures, and imperial glory into urban spaces, making sculpture a witness and participant in urban history. The bas-reliefs on triumphal arches recorded the victory exploits of generals, and the portrait sculptures of emperors showcased the divine and majestic presence of rulers. These sculptures were not only artistic decorations but also visual witnesses to history, strengthening citizens' identification with history and loyalty to the empire.</p>
            <h4>Monumental Sculptures: Visual Records of History</h4>
            <p>Roman urban spaces were filled with numerous monumental sculptures, such as war memorials, victory columns, and statues of historical figures, which recorded the glorious history of the empire and the achievements of heroes, becoming visual witnesses to urban history. For example, the bas-reliefs on the Column of Trajan detailed the war process of Emperor Trajan's conquest of Dacia, showcasing the bravery of the Roman army and the splendor of victory. These monumental sculptures were not only records of history but also visual displays of imperial glory, reinforcing citizens' identification with history and loyalty to the empire.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: From Imitator to Transcendent, From Stone to Eternity</h3>
            <p>Roman sculpture began as an "imitator" of Greek art but, through continuous absorption, innovation, and breakthrough, ultimately surpassed Greek art. Roman artists not only inherited the idealized aesthetics of Greek sculpture but also created a unique art form through realistic depiction, diversity of themes, and the strengthening of political functions. At the same time, the perfect integration of Roman sculpture with urban spaces not only shaped Rome's unique urban landscape but also provided valuable inspiration for subsequent art and urban planning.</p>
            <p>The success of Roman sculpture lies not only in its精湛的技艺与深刻的内涵，but also in its profound understanding of the essence of art: art should not be confined to a fixed model but should continuously explore new possibilities through reference. It is this process of imitation to transcendence that makes Roman sculpture not only an important symbol of ancient Roman culture but also an immortal chapter in the history of Western art. Through sculpture, the Roman Empire permanently inscribed the authority of rulers, the glory of the empire, and the memory of history into stone, making it the "Empire on Stone," an eternal visual narrator.</p>
