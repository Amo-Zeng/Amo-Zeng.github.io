            <h3>I. From "Humanization" to "Personalization": New Dimensions in Trust Services</h3>
            <p>Before the rise of the digital economy, "humanized" services were the gold standard in the service industry, emphasizing a people-centric approach and providing warm, meticulous service experiences. However, as the digital wave swept across, the limitations of "humanized" services gradually became apparent: scaling bottlenecks, inefficiency, and lack of personalization made it difficult to meet the growing demand for personalized services.</p>
            <h4>1.1 Limitations and Challenges of "Humanized" Services</h4>
            <p>Traditional "humanized" services rely on significant human input, making scaling difficult; at the same time, manual services are less efficient and struggle to cope with massive information and rapidly changing market environments. Additionally, "humanized" services often become superficial and fail to truly understand and meet the personalized needs of each customer.</p>
            <h4>1.2 The Rise of "Personalized" Services</h4>
            <p>"Personalized" services compensate for the shortcomings of "humanized" services through data-driven insights, efficiency improvements, and deep connections. Based on big data and artificial intelligence technologies, service providers can accurately identify customer needs and provide tailored service solutions; through automation and intelligent processes, service efficiency is significantly improved; through continuous interaction and feedback, deeper customer relationships are established, enhancing customer loyalty.</p>
            <h4>1.3 The Critical Role of Trust</h4>
            <p>Whether in "humanized" or "personalized" services, trust remains the core. However, in the transition from "humanized" to "personalized" services, maintaining trust faces new challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Security</strong>: Personalized services rely on the collection and analysis of vast amounts of data, increasing the risk of data breaches;</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithm Transparency</strong>: Personalized recommendation algorithms are often seen as "black boxes," making it difficult for customers to understand their logic;</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Connection</strong>: Technology-driven services may weaken emotional interactions between people, leading to a colder service experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To address these challenges, service providers must adhere to ethical standards, enhance technical capabilities, prioritize customer experiences, and treat "trust" as the core link in service transformation.</p>

            <h3>II. From "Centralization" to "Decentralization": Blockchain Reshapes Trust</h3>
            <p>As digitalization deepens, the shortcomings of centralized trust mechanisms become increasingly evident. Relying on centralized institutions such as banks, governments, or platforms to establish trust not only incurs high costs but also presents risks of centralized trust crises and limited scope.</p>
            <h4>2.1 The Dilemmas of Centralized Trust Mechanisms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Trust Costs</strong>: Regulatory and operational costs of centralized institutions are ultimately borne by users;</li>
                <li><strong>Concentrated Trust Risks</strong>: Problems with centralized institutions can lead to severe trust crises;</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Trust Scope</strong>: The service range of centralized institutions is constrained by their capabilities, making it difficult to meet global and diverse needs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.2 Blockchain: A Revolution in Decentralized Trust</h4>
            <p>Blockchain technology, with its decentralized, immutable, and traceable features, brings a profound transformation to trust services. Blockchain enables trust to be established without relying on centralized institutions by maintaining a transparent, publicly verifiable transaction record through a distributed ledger. Its core advantages include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decentralization</strong>: Eliminates single points of failure and reduces trust risks;</li>
                <li><strong>Immutability</strong>: Ensures data authenticity and credibility;</li>
                <li><strong>Traceability</strong>: Provides reliable evidence for accountability and dispute resolution.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.3 Blockchain's Reconfiguration of Trust Services</h4>
            <p>Blockchain technology has already demonstrated significant potential in areas such as finance, supply chain management, identity authentication, and data sharing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Finance</strong>: Enables peer-to-peer value transfer, reducing transaction costs and increasing efficiency;</li>
                <li><strong>Supply Chain Management</strong>: Enhances information transparency and traceability, protecting consumer rights;</li>
                <li><strong>Identity Authentication</strong>: Provides secure and trusted digital identity services;</li>
                <li><strong>Data Sharing</strong>: Builds trusted data sharing platforms, promoting data value discovery.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although blockchain technology still faces challenges such as performance, security, and regulation, its decentralized nature offers infinite possibilities for building a fairer, more transparent, and efficient trusted society.</p>

            <h3>III. From "Static" to "Dynamic": The Real-Time Evolution of Trust Services</h3>
            <p>In the digital era, traditional static trust models are no longer sufficient to keep pace with rapidly changing environments. Static trust models rely on third-party certifications and static data, facing issues such as information lag, data silos, and centralized risks.</p>
            <h4>3.1 The Dilemmas of Static Trust Models</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information Update Lag</strong>: Static mechanisms struggle to reflect real-time user behavior changes;</li>
                <li><strong>Data Silo Effect</strong>: Data between different platforms is difficult to interconnect;</li>
                <li><strong>Centralized Risks</strong>: Failures or misuse of a single trusted third party threaten user security.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3.2 The Rise of Dynamic Trust Services</h4>
            <p>Dynamic trust services build a more flexible and secure trust system through real-time data collection, intelligent algorithm evaluation, and decentralized architecture:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Data Collection</strong>: Utilizing IoT and blockchain technology to obtain user behavior data in real time;</li>
                <li><strong>Intelligent Algorithm Evaluation</strong>: Dynamically assessing user risk through machine learning and data mining technologies;</li>
                <li><strong>Decentralized Architecture</strong>: Based on blockchain technology, reducing centralized risks and increasing transparency.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3.3 Application Scenarios of Dynamic Trust Services</h4>
            <p>Dynamic trust services have already demonstrated significant potential in fintech, the sharing economy, and social networks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fintech</strong>: Enabling instant loan approvals and intelligent risk control;</li>
                <li><strong>Sharing Economy</strong>: Ensuring platform security and user experience;</li>
                <li><strong>Social Networks</strong>: Combating fake information and online fraud.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although dynamic trust services still face challenges such as data security, algorithm fairness, and legal regulations, their development prospects are vast. In the future, as technology advances and societal awareness improves, dynamic trust services will become an important cornerstone for building a safer and more trusted digital society.</p>
