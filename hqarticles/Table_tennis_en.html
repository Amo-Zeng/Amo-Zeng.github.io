            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into daily life — from personalized content recommendations to facial recognition systems. However, this widespread adoption of AI raises concerns about data privacy. AI models often require vast amounts of personal data to function effectively, leaving individuals vulnerable to misuse, data breaches, and unauthorized surveillance.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is essential for users to understand how their data is collected, processed, and protected while engaging with AI-powered services and tools.

            <h2>Risks and Ethical Concerns</h2>
            <p>
                AI technologies such as machine learning and natural language processing collect data from various sources, including browsing behavior, social media profiles, and biometric information. When not properly secured or anonymized, these data sets can lead to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Loss of user privacy through profiling</li>
                <li>Unintended bias in decision-making algorithms</li>
                <li>Data leaks and identity theft incidents</li>
                <li>Increased surveillance in public and private sectors</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Strategies for Protecting Personal Data</h2>
            <p>
                While data privacy concerns are growing, users can take practical steps to protect their information in an AI-driven world:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Review and limit the permissions granted to AI tools and mobile apps</li>
                <li>Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA)</li>
                <li>Be cautious with personal details on public platforms or social media</li>
                <li>Opt out of data sharing where possible</li>
                <li>Stay updated on data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="policy">
            <h2>Policy and Governance in the AI Age</h2>
            <p>
                Governments and organizations worldwide are beginning to implement laws and frameworks to regulate AI and protect digital rights. Policies such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) offer transparency and control, allowing users to access, modify, or delete the data collected about them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving forward, collaboration between technology providers, lawmakers, and users will be essential in creating a secure digital ecosystem.
