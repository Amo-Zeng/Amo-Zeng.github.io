            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Modernism, the artistic and cultural revolution that began at the end of the 19th century and continued throughout the 20th century, not only subverted traditional artistic rules in form, but also profoundly influenced every aspect of human society at the level of thought and culture. Through its reflection on modern lifestyle, reconstruction of global cultural diversity, and dialectical process of self-deconstruction, modernism profoundly shaped the various facets of human society. Modernism is both an aesthetic revolution of "decoupling," a "cultural translator" of globalization, and a concept that continuously self-deconstructs and reshapes itself. These three identities intertwine to form the complex and profound essence of modernism.</p>

            <h3>I. Modernism: An Aesthetic Revolution of Decoupling for Lifestyle</h3>
            <p>The birth of modernism is closely linked to the industrialization process. At the end of the 19th century, the machine production, urbanization, and social division brought by the Industrial Revolution made human life more complex and burdensome than ever before. The traditional agricultural society was broken, and people's lifestyles were reconstructed by the assembly lines of factories, skyscrapers of cities, and the rapid iteration of modern technology. Meanwhile, the decorative art style of the Victorian era reached its peak in the fields of art and design, with excessive decoration and embellishment becoming the mainstream of the time.</p>
            <p>However, this "surplus" was not only reflected in the material plane but also manifested in the cultural plane. Excessive decoration, intricate social etiquette, and inflated material desires squeezed the spiritual and material lives of modern people. Against this backdrop, modernism emerged, attempting to "decouple" modern society by simplifying and returning to the essence.</p>
            <p>One of the core ideas of modernism is "functionalism," where design should be guided by function rather than decoration. This idea is particularly evident in architecture, design, and art. For example, the Bauhaus school advocated "less is more," emphasizing the simplicity and practicality of design; modernist architect Le Corbusier proposed that "a house is a machine for living," placing functional living space at the forefront. The intention of these ideas was not merely to pursue aesthetic simplification, but to make people's lives easier and more efficient through simplified design.</p>
            <p>The decoupling of modernism is not only reflected in the material plane but also in the spiritual plane. By removing excessive decoration and form, modernism sought to free people from the heavy burdens of material and spiritual life. However, the decoupling of modernism was not without cost. Although it attempted to lighten the burden of life through simplified design, modernism often brought new burdens in practice. For instance, while modernist architecture emphasized functionality, overly functional designs often ignored human emotional and psychological needs, leading to feelings of coldness and alienation; modernist art, by abstracting and decentralizing, broke free from traditional constraints but also lost its resonance with the masses, becoming a symbol of elitism.</p>

            <h3>II. Modernism: The "Cultural Translator" of Globalization</h3>
            <p>Modernism was not only a revolution in art but also a cultural revolution. It functioned like a "cultural translator," re-encoding various heterogeneous cultural elements into a universal artistic language during the wave of globalization. This language broke the traditional Western-centric model and established new cultural connections globally, thus revealing the dual identity of modernism in the context of globalization: both a deconstructor and a reconstructor of culture.</p>
            <p>The deconstruction of modernism is reflected in its rebellion against traditional art forms. Artists no longer contented themselves with mimicking the real world but began to boldly break traditional artistic rules. This rebellion was not only manifested in form but also in thought. They drew inspiration from cultures around the world, introducing non-Western art elements into the context of Western art. For example, Picasso's "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" was not only a subversion of traditional painting but also the first deep dialogue between African art and Western modernism. Through this dialogue, modernist artists liberated Western art from its own cultural traditions, making it a more inclusive and open artistic form.</p>
            <p>The reconstruction of modernism is reflected in its integration of global culture. By incorporating cultural elements from around the world into Western art, modernist artists created a new artistic language that could reflect the modernity of Western society while expressing the diversity of global culture. This reconstruction process is a bidirectional cultural translation. Western artists drew inspiration from non-Western cultures, while also allowing these cultures to enter the Western mainstream discourse in new forms. For example, the influence of Japanese ukiyo-e on European Impressionist painters not only led Western artists to rediscover the uniqueness of Eastern art but also allowed Eastern art to be reinterpreted and disseminated in the context of globalization.</p>
            <p>The global impact of modernism was not limited to the art field; it also profoundly influenced literature, architecture, design, and other fields. In literature, modernism broke traditional linear narrative structures through stream-of-consciousness and fragmented narrative methods, enabling literary works to express the inner world of modern people more freely. In architecture, modernism created a new architectural language through simple lines and functionalist design, which not only suited Western cities but also gradually became the common language of global urbanization.</p>
            <p>However, the globalization of modernism also brought new challenges. On one hand, the popularity of modernism may lead to cultural homogenization, causing the features of various cultures to gradually disappear; on the other hand, the diversity of modernism makes dialogue between different cultures more complex and layered. How to maintain cultural diversity in the globalization of modernism has become an important issue for modernism to address.</p>

            <h3>III. Modernism: A Concept of Continuous "Self-Decomposition"</h3>
            <p>Modernism is not only a revolution in aesthetics or culture but also a concept that continuously self-deconstructs and reshapes itself. From the urban wanderer in Baudelaire's writings to Flaubert's disenchantment with reality, and to Picasso's deconstruction of form, modernism has carried a gene of self-deconstruction from its inception. As Benjamin put it, modernism is "both a negation of tradition and a reconstruction of tradition." In this dialectic relationship, modernism is always in an unfinished state, constantly breaking itself and rebuilding itself.</p>
            <p>The self-deconstruction of modernism is not only reflected in the art field but also deeply reflects the internal contradictions of modernity. It is both a victory of human reason and a rebellion against rationalism; it is both a symbol of technological progress and a questioning of technological rule; it is both a manifesto of individualism and a projection of collective anxiety. As Derrida stated, "Deconstruction is not destruction; it is revelation." Through continuous self-deconstruction, modernism reveals the multiple aspects and internal tensions of modernity.</p>
            <p>This characteristic of self-deconstruction makes modernism an eternally open text. It is no longer a fixed aesthetics or ideology but a state that is always in the process of generation. It is precisely in this continuous deconstruction and reconstruction that modernism maintains its vitality and life force. It reminds us that true modernity lies not in adhering to a fixed mode but in maintaining the ability for continuous self-reflection and self-renewal.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Modernism is not only an aesthetic revolution but also a cultural movement that attempts to decouple modern lifestyle. It seeks to free people from the heavy burdens of material and spiritual life through simplification and a return to essence. At the same time, as a "cultural translator" of globalization, modernism breaks traditional cultural boundaries and creates a new global cultural language. However, the self-deconstruction trait of modernism makes it a continuously reshaping concept, revealing the multiple aspects and internal tensions of modernity. Today, we may re-examine the legacy of modernism to find a more balanced lifestyle, neither burdened by excessive materialism nor constrained by simplified forms, achieving a true balance between "decoupling" and "reconstruction."</p>
