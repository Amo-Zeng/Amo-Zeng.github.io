            <h3>Modernism Expression in the Digital Age</h3>
            <h4>Social Media: The New Stage for Modernism</h4>
            <p>Social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok provide unprecedented opportunities for modernism's self-expression. Users can express their inner emotions and individual experiences through images, text, and short videos. The immediacy and interactivity of these platforms allow the core ideas of modernism—individual uniqueness and emotional authenticity—to be more widely spread and shared.</p>
            <p>For example, TikTok creators use editing, music, and special effects to create works with strong personal styles. These works not only reveal the creators' inner worlds but also establish emotional resonance with the audience through interaction and comments. This method of creation aligns with the spirit of modernism because it emphasizes the unique perspective and authentic expression of emotions.</p>
            <h4>Blogs: The Power of Words and the Continuation of Modernism</h4>
            <p>Blogs, as a digital writing platform, continue and develop the literary tradition of modernism. Bloggers share their daily lives, thoughts, and emotions through personal websites or blogging platforms. This form of self-expression not only continues modernism's focus on individual experience but also allows more people to share and understand these experiences through the internet's wide reach.</p>
            <p>Modernist literature often uses fluid narrative structures and inner monologues. Bloggers can also use these techniques to express their inner worlds. For example, some bloggers use long self-reflections and emotional outpourings to explore the complexities of human psychology and the diversity of social realities. This writing method is not only a continuation of modernism but also makes this expression more vivid and direct through digital means.</p>
            <h4>Virtual Reality: The Future Path of Modernism</h4>
            <p>Virtual Reality (VR) technology provides richer and more diverse possibilities for modernism's self-expression. Through VR, users can immerse themselves in a virtual world created by themselves, expressing their inner emotions and individual experiences. This immersive experience allows the core ideas of modernism—individual uniqueness and emotional authenticity—to be more deeply represented.</p>
            <p>For example, some artists create virtual artworks through VR, which not only reveal the creators' inner worlds but also allow the audience to understand and experience these emotions more deeply through interaction and immersion. This method of creation aligns with the spirit of modernism because it emphasizes the unique perspective and authentic expression of emotions.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Fusion of Modernism in the Context of Globalization</h3>
            <h4>Global Spread of Modernism</h4>
            <p>Modernism originated in early 20th-century Europe and North America as a rebellion and innovation against traditional art and culture. It emphasizes individualization, innovation, and diverse expressions of reality. With the process of globalization, modernism's ideas and techniques have rapidly spread around the world, becoming an important part of global cultural exchange.</p>
            <h4>Modernism in Asia: Fusion and Innovation</h4>
            <p>In Asia, modernism is not just an imitation of Western art but a deep reflection and innovation on local culture. For example, Japanese modernist artists like Takamura Kōtarō and Sugimura Hiroshi created unique artistic styles by integrating Western modernism with traditional Japanese aesthetics. Takamura Kōtarō's sculpture "Nude" (1928) is an exemplar of this cultural fusion, showcasing both Western modernist abstract styles and traditional Japanese aesthetic elements.</p>
            <h4>Modernism in Africa: Self-Discovery and Expression</h4>
            <p>In Africa, the reception and variation of modernism are more reflected in the resistance against colonialism and racial oppression. African artists use modernist forms to express a renewed understanding of self-identity and cultural traditions. Nigerian artist Ben Enwonwu is a typical example, whose work "Anyanwu" (1955) combines traditional African sculptural styles with modernist abstract techniques, becoming a classic of African modern art.</p>
            <h4>Modernism in Latin America: Social Critique and Cultural Revival</h4>
            <p>In Latin America, modernism is not just artistic innovation but also a profound critique of social realities and a call for cultural revival. The Mexican mural movement and the Brazilian concrete art movement are important manifestations of modernism in Latin America. Diego Rivera's mural "Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in the Alameda Central" (1947) uses modernist techniques to express a deep reflection on Mexican history and social realities.</p>

            <h3>Dialogue between Modernism and Environmental Protection</h3>
            <h4>Modernist Literature and Environmental Protection</h4>
            <p>Modernist literary works often depict the loneliness and helplessness of humans in the process of industrialization and urbanization. For example, T.S. Eliot's poem "The Waste Land" reveals the emptiness and desolation of the human spirit through its portrayal of modern city life. This critique and reflection on modern society can also extend to concerns about the natural environment.</p>
            <p>In modernist literature, nature is often seen as a force opposing industrialization and urbanization. Virginia Woolf's "To the Lighthouse" intertwines natural landscapes and human emotions, showing the deep connection between humans and nature. This depiction is not just a praise of natural beauty but also a lament for the lost connection with nature in modern society.</p>
            <h4>Modernist Art and Environmental Protection</h4>
            <p>Modernist artworks can also convey concerns about environmental protection through visual language. For example, Pablo Picasso's "Guernica" reveals the dual destruction of nature and humanity by war through its portrayal of the horrors of war. This critique of war and violence can be extended to reflections on environmental destruction.</p>
            <p>Modernist abstract art explores the relationship between humans and nature through non-traditional visual expression. Kandinsky's abstract paintings use changes in color and form to express reverence for the natural world and critique of modern society. This abstract expression can inspire deep thoughts about environmental protection in the audience.</p>
            <h4>Modernist Architecture and Environmental Protection</h4>
            <p>Modernist architecture emphasizes functionality and simplicity in design, but in the context of environmental protection, this concept can be further developed into sustainable design. For example, Le Corbusier's architectural designs emphasize the integration of light, space, and nature, which can be applied to the design of modern green buildings.</p>
            <p>Green buildings not only respect the environment but also enhance the quality of human life. By using energy-efficient materials, natural light, and airflow, modernist architecture can achieve environmental protection goals while maintaining its aesthetic characteristics.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Modernism has found new survival spaces and expressive forms in the digital age and the context of globalization. Through social media, blogs, and virtual reality digital platforms, modernism's self-expression can be more widely spread and shared. At the same time, modernism's reception and variation in different cultural backgrounds during the globalization process have enriched cultural expressions around the world and promoted cultural exchange and fusion.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the dialogue between modernism and environmental protection is not just a continuation of modernist ideas but also their innovation and development. Through literature, art, and architecture, modernism can inspire people's attention and thoughts on environmental protection. In the current context of global environmental degradation, the reflective and critical spirit of modernism can provide new perspectives and driving forces for environmental protection.</p>
            <p>Through this dialogue, we can not only better understand the profound impact of modernism but also explore how to combine modernist ideas with the practical needs of environmental protection. This combination is not just a continuation of modernism but also its innovation and development. In the future, the dialogue between modernism and environmental protection will continue to drive social progress and promote the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature.</p>
