            <h2>Introduction: The Dynamic Interaction Between Signs and Reality</h2>
            <p>In the vast realm of human cognition and communication, "reference" is not only a bridge between signs and reality but also a dynamic, multidimensional interactive process. Traditional semiotic theories often view "reference" as a unidirectional relationship, where a sign points to an object, and the object becomes the signified of the sign. However, this unidirectional perspective overlooks the complex interactions between signs and objects, and how these interactions generate meaning within multiple dimensions of society, culture, and power. This article will re-examine the essence of "reference" from various angles, including the agency of signs, the characteristics of objects, bidirectional interaction, boundary fluidity, multiple references, fictionality, power relations, and ideology, to reveal the deep connections between signs and reality.</p>

            <h3>I. The Agency of Signs: The Cultural Power of Meaning Construction</h3>
            <p>Signs are not merely passive carriers of objects; they possess specific forms, meanings, and cultural connotations, actively participating in the construction of meaning. Take "roses" as an example. As a sign, "roses" not only refer to a type of plant but also carry rich symbolic meanings such as love, romance, and beauty. These meanings do not stem from the object itself but are attributed and interpreted by human culture. Under different cultural backgrounds, the symbolic meanings of "roses" may vary: in Chinese culture, they are more associated with beauty and friendship, while in Western culture, they are closely linked to love.</p>
            <p>The agency of signs is also reflected in their form itself, which influences meaning. For instance, both "roses" and "diamond rings" are symbols of love, but they differ significantly in form. "Roses," as plants, possess characteristics of life force and ephemerality, symbolizing the beauty and fragility of love, while "diamond rings," as human-made objects, symbolize eternity and preciousness, representing the steadfastness and permanence of love. This difference in form enriches the meaning of signs and reflects diverse cultural understandings and expressions of emotions.</p>

            <h3>II. The Agency of Objects: The Interplay of Characteristics and Cultural Context</h3>
            <p>Objects are not entirely passive recipients of signification; their own characteristics, history, and cultural context also influence the meaning of signs. Take "dragon" as an example. In different cultural contexts, the object referred to by "dragon" and its symbolic meanings may vary greatly. In Chinese culture, "dragon" symbolizes power, strength, and auspiciousness, serving as the totem of the Chinese nation, while in Western culture, "dragon" symbolizes evil and brutality, as a monster to be conquered by knights. This difference does not arise from the sign itself but from the connotations and meanings of the object "dragon" in different cultural contexts.</p>
            <p>The historical and cultural background of objects also influences the meaning of signs. For example, "red" symbolizes happiness and auspiciousness in Chinese culture, while in Western culture, it symbolizes danger and warning. This difference can be traced back to the origins and usage history of "red" in different cultures. In traditional Chinese culture, red is regarded as a color of celebration, while in Western culture, it is associated with bloodshed and war. This cultural background difference complicates signification and reveals the agency of objects within the semiotic system.</p>

            <h3>III. Bidirectional Interaction and Meaning Generation: A Dynamic Semiotic System</h3>
            <p>The relationship between signs and objects is not a simple unidirectional pointing but a dynamic, interactive process. This bidirectional interaction continuously generates new meanings. Take the internet slang "Versailles Literature" as an example. Initially, it referred to a literary style characterized by "bragging," but over time, its meaning evolved into a specific internet cultural phenomenon, used to调侃 those who deliberately show off and pretend to be casual. This evolution of meaning stems from the bidirectional interaction between signs and objects: on one hand, the sign "Versailles Literature" continuously absorbs new elements of internet culture; on the other hand, boastful behaviors in real life are constantly being symbolized, becoming the object referred to by "Versailles Literature."</p>
            <p>This bidirectional interaction makes the semiotic system an open, evolving system. The meaning of signs is not fixed but changes with time, space, and cultural contexts. For instance, the term "comrade" had specific political connotations during a particular historical period in China, while in contemporary society, it is more commonly used to refer to the LGBTQ+ community. This change reflects the complex interaction between signs and objects and reveals the dynamic and open nature of the semiotic system.</p>

            <h3>IV. Fluid Boundaries of Signs: An Open River of Reference</h3>
            <p>The boundaries of signs are not fixed but fluid, like a river that flows without ceasing. Take "artificial intelligence" as an example. When this concept was proposed in the 1950s, it referred to a simple rule-based logical system. With the passage of time and technological advancements, particularly the rise of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, the scope of "artificial intelligence" has expanded to include complex systems capable of autonomous learning, reasoning, and decision-making. This expansion of boundaries is not accidental but deeply influenced by context, culture, and cognition. Different historical backgrounds, technological environments, and social needs all reinterpret and redefine the scope of signification.</p>
            <p>This fluidity and openness of boundaries make the relationship of signification more complex and diverse. Signs are no longer merely tools of reference but dynamic, expanding networks of meaning. This expansion enriches the connotations of signs and provides more possibilities for human cognition and communication.</p>

            <h3>V. Multiple References and Meaning Competition: A Carnival of Signs</h3>
            <p>The world of signs is not a one-to-one relationship but more akin to a carnival where different signs interweave and collide, vying for dominance of meaning. Take "An Tai" as an example. In traditional Chinese culture, this concept plays multiple roles. It refers to both a philosophical thought seeking inner peace and harmony with nature and a method of achieving physical and mental health through the practice of breath regulation and meditation. This multiple reference is not chaotic but constructs a complex network of meaning, where different meanings are interrelated and mutually constrained, ultimately forming a dynamically balanced system.</p>
            <p>This multiple reference relationship reveals the ambiguity and diversity of signs, reflecting the multivalence of human culture. The meaning of signs is not singular and fixed but can be attributed with multiple interpretations through different reference methods. This diversity enriches the connotations of signs and makes them an indispensable part of human culture.</p>

            <h3>VI. Fictionality and Unreliability: The Boundary Between Reality and Imagination</h3>
            <p>The relationship between signs and reality is not always reliable. In some cases, this relationship may even be fictional. Take "mermaids" as an example. This image refers to a mythical creature that does not exist in reality. However, this does not mean that the sign "mermaids" is meaningless. On the contrary, it carries human longing for the ocean, exploration of the unknown, and imagination of romantic love. This fictional relationship of reference is not a flaw of signs but part of their charm. It provides humans with a space for imagination beyond reality, allowing us to freely soar between the boundaries of reality and fiction.</p>
            <p>This fictionality and unreliability make the relationship of signification more complex and multidimensional. Signs can point not only to reality but also to fiction, and even to imaginations beyond reality. This diversity enriches the connotations of signs and makes them an indispensable part of human culture.</p>

            <h3>VII. Power Relations and Manipulation of Reference: Ideological Infiltration</h3>
            <p>"Reference" is not merely a simple relationship between signs and objects; it also profoundly involves power relations and ideology. In society, who possesses the power to define the reference of signs directly relates to the distribution of discourse power. Mainstream media, government institutions, and academia are important holders of discourse power, shaping and maintaining social consensus through specific reference methods. For example, mainstream media often use specific vocabulary and expressions when reporting social events, which not only convey information about the events but also implicitly convey evaluations and stances on the events. This construction of reference methods often guides public attention and emotional tendencies, thereby influencing the formation of public opinion.</p>
            <p>Moreover, ruling classes and interest groups often utilize the reference function of signs to disseminate specific ideologies and values. For instance, advertisers use specific signs and imagery to refer to certain products, which not only convey product information but also shape consumer desires and needs. Political propaganda uses specific signs and discourse to shape and disseminate specific political ideologies and values. For example, national symbols (such as flags and emblems) are imbued with strong nationalism and patriotism, reinforcing national identity and mobilizing public support and participation.</p>

            <h3>VIII. Conclusion: The Polyphony of Reference and the Future of Signs</h3>
            <p>"Reference" is not merely a linguistic or semiotic issue; it profoundly involves multiple dimensions of power relations, ideology, and social culture. By analyzing the agency of signs, the characteristics of objects, bidirectional interaction, boundary fluidity, multiple references, fictionality, power relations, and ideology, we can comprehensively understand the complex interactions between signs and reality. This understanding not only helps us critically examine information and symbols but also enables us to better participate in and influence social change.</p>
            <p>The ambiguity and uncertainty of reference are not weaknesses of the semiotic system but sources of its vitality. It is this ambiguity and uncertainty that endow signs with fluidity, diversity, and creativity, allowing them to continuously evolve, expand, and regenerate in different contexts, cultures, and cognitions. In the digital era, the interaction between signs and objects is more frequent and complex, providing us with more opportunities and challenges to explore and understand the deeper meanings behind signs. By breaking the unidirectionality of reference and re-examining the relationship between signs and objects, we can better understand the meaning generation mechanism of signs and their significant role in social culture.</p>
            <p>In the future semiotic world, we will continue to explore the mysteries of reference, seeking balance between ambiguity and certainty, and discovering new possibilities within uncertainty. The interplay and symbiosis of signs and reality will become an important way for us to understand the world and construct meaning.</p>
