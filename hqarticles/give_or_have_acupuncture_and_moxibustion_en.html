            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Acupuncture, an ancient medical art that carries the wisdom of the Chinese nation for thousands of years, has been rejuvenated in the wave of modern medicine. However, traditional acupuncture therapy, centered on "needles" and "points," seems to struggle to fully adapt to the complex and ever-changing disease spectrum and the increasingly diverse needs of patients. "Acupuncture+" emerges as a solution, not just as a technical overlay, but as a revolutionary way of thinking, a necessary choice for the acupuncture discipline to embrace change and actively expand its application boundaries.</p>

                <li><strong>Laser Acupuncture:</strong> Using low-intensity laser to irradiate acupoints, it is painless and non-invasive, particularly suitable for patients afraid of traditional needle stimulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Ultrasound Acupuncture:</strong> Precisely detecting acupoint positions through ultrasound technology, improving treatment accuracy, suitable for complex disease treatment.</li>
            </ul>
