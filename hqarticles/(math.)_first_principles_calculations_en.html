            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Over the past few decades, scientific research, particularly in the fields of materials science and chemistry, has primarily relied on experimental-driven methods. However, this approach has faced numerous bottlenecks such as inefficiency, high costs, and unpredictable results. With the rapid advancement of computational power, first-principles calculations have gradually become a disruptive force reshaping the paradigm of scientific discovery. This computational method not only challenges traditional research pathways but also, through its high accuracy and universality, drives cross-disciplinary fusion, opening up new horizons for scientific research.</p>
