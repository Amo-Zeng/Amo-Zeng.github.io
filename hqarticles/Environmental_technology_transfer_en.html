            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the context of increasingly severe global environmental issues, environmental technology transfer has become a key tool for the international community to address climate change, pollution control, and ecosystem protection. However, the traditional model of environmental technology transfer, primarily centered around "technical assistance," where developed countries provide advanced technologies to developing countries, has achieved certain short-term successes but also revealed its limitations. These limitations include inadequate technical adaptability, lack of sustainability, and over-dependence on external support. Therefore, environmental technology transfer urgently needs to shift from "technical assistance" to "capacity building," by constructing more sustainable, equitable, and efficient cooperation models to promote the in-depth development of global environmental governance. This article will start from the limitations of "technical assistance," explore the core concepts of "capacity building," and propose new pathways from "one-way output" to "two-way interaction," and from "single technology" to "system solutions," aiming to provide deeper and more forward-looking insights for environmental technology transfer.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>I. Limitations of the Traditional "Technical Assistance" Model</h3>
            <p>In the traditional model of environmental technology transfer, developed countries, as the technology providers, offer advanced environmental technologies to developing countries, such as wastewater treatment, waste management, and renewable energy technologies. While this model has alleviated some environmental issues in developing countries to a certain extent, its limitations have also become increasingly evident:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Technical "Misfit"</strong>: Technologies developed in developed countries are often based on their own natural and social conditions. When applied in developing countries, they frequently fail to achieve expected effects due to environmental differences, inadequate infrastructure, and incomplete policies and regulations. For example, advanced wastewater treatment technologies may not be implemented in developing countries due to a lack of supporting pipeline systems.</li>
                <li><strong>"Here Today, Gone Tomorrow" Phenomenon</strong>: Technical assistance is usually one-time, lacking follow-up tracking and support, which makes it difficult for technologies to sustain operation and improvement in developing countries. For instance, some equipment may quickly become ineffective after installation due to a lack of maintenance and local technical personnel support.</li>
                <li><strong>Dependence Issues</strong>: The technical assistance model causes developing countries to rely long-term on external technical support, lacking自主研发和创新能力. This not only limits the process of technology localization but also places developing countries in a passive position in long-term environmental governance.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>II. Transition from "Technical Assistance" to "Capacity Building"</h3>
            <p>"Capacity building" emphasizes multi-level, multi-dimensional cooperation to help developing countries establish the ability to independently research, apply, and innovate environmental technologies, thereby achieving sustainable environmental governance. Compared to traditional "technical assistance," "capacity building" has the following significant advantages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Localization and Adaptive Modification of Technology</strong>: Capacity building not only focuses on technology transfer but also on technology localization. By collaborating with local research institutions and enterprises, environmental technologies suitable for local natural conditions and socio-economic situations are developed, avoiding the issue of technical "misfit." For example, joint research centers are established to develop low-cost, easy-to-maintain environmental technologies tailored to the specific needs of developing countries.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultivating Local Technical Talent</strong>: The core of capacity building lies in talent cultivation. By establishing technical training systems, providing educational resources, and offering practical opportunities, a team of professionals with environmental technology research, application, and management capabilities is cultivated in developing countries. This not only helps sustain technology application but also lays the foundation for future technological innovation.</li>
                <li><strong>Building a Comprehensive Legal, Regulatory, and Standards Framework</strong>: Capacity building also includes helping developing countries formulate and improve environmental-related laws, regulations, standards, and policy systems, providing institutional guarantees for technology application and promotion. For example, assisting in the development of technical standards for water pollution control to ensure the normative and effective application of technology.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>III. From "One-Way Output" to "Two-Way Interaction": Shaping a New Cooperative Model for Environmental Technology Transfer</h3>
            <p>In the context of global environmental protection and sustainable development, the traditional "one-way output" model can no longer meet the complex needs of environmental governance. Developing countries, through long-term environmental governance practices, have accumulated rich experience and wisdom, which are equally valuable. Therefore, environmental technology transfer should shift from "one-way output" to "two-way interaction," building an equal, mutually beneficial, and win-win technical transfer mechanism.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Equal Cooperation and Benefit Sharing</strong>: In the process of technology transfer, developing countries are not only recipients of technology but also co-developers. Through joint research, technology sharing, and benefit distribution mechanisms, mutual benefits are achieved. For example, establishing joint development platforms to encourage both parties to participate in technology research and development, creating localized environmental solutions suitable for local needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Two-Way Flow of Experience and Wisdom</strong>: Although developed countries possess advanced technologies, developing countries have accumulated rich practical experience in addressing local environmental issues. By establishing joint development platforms and experience exchange mechanisms, both parties can jointly explore localized environmental solutions suitable for local needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Localization and Innovation Capacity Building</strong>: The "two-way interaction" model emphasizes the localization of technologies and the cultivation of innovation capabilities. By jointly establishing research centers and cultivating local technical talent, developing countries can gradually possess the ability for independent research and innovation, enabling sustainable technology application.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>IV. From "Single Technology" to "System Solutions": A New Paradigm for Environmental Technology Transfer</h3>
            <p>Environmental issues are often complex and systemic, and the introduction of a single technology is insufficient to address the root problems. Therefore, environmental technology transfer should shift from "single technology" to "system solutions," providing comprehensive solutions that cover technology, policy, funding, management, and other aspects to address specific environmental issues.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Technology Integration</strong>: System solutions emphasize the integration and synergy of technologies. For example, in water pollution control, in addition to introducing advanced wastewater treatment technologies, it is also necessary to consider pollution source control, water resource management, public participation, and other aspects to form a complete technology chain.</li>
                <li><strong>Policy Support</strong>: System solutions require policy support and guidance. By formulating and implementing relevant environmental laws, regulations, standards, and incentive mechanisms, a favorable policy environment is provided for technology transfer and application.</li>
                <li><strong>Funding Assurance</strong>: System solutions require sufficient financial support. By establishing diversified financing channels, such as international aid, government grants, and enterprise investments, financial assurance is provided for technology transfer and application.</li>
                <li><strong>Management Optimization</strong>: System solutions emphasize the optimization and coordination of management. By establishing an efficient organizational management system, the smooth implementation of technology transfer and application is ensured, achieving long-term sustainability.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Case Study: System Solutions for Water Pollution Control</h3>
            <p>Taking water pollution control as an example, the construction of system solutions can be carried out from the following aspects:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pollution Source Control</strong>: Control industrial, agricultural, and domestic pollution source emissions through technical means and policy measures, reducing the pollution load of water bodies.</li>
                <li><strong>Wastewater Treatment Technology</strong>: Introduce advanced wastewater treatment technologies, such as biological treatment and membrane technology, to improve treatment efficiency and water quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Resource Management</strong>: Through scientific water resource management, optimize the allocation and utilization of water resources, improving water resource utilization efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Participation</strong>: Enhance public environmental awareness through education and public participation, fostering a social atmosphere where the entire society collaborates in water pollution control.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>V. Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The transition from "technical assistance" to "capacity building" marks a new stage in the development of environmental technology transfer. By constructing an equal and mutually beneficial cooperation mechanism, cultivating local technical talent, and providing system solutions, environmental technology transfer not only addresses environmental issues faced by developing countries but also helps them establish independent environmental technology research and application capabilities. This model is not only more sustainable and equitable but also provides new momentum and direction for global environmental protection and sustainable development. Future environmental technology transfer should place greater emphasis on "capacity building," jointly constructing a harmonious future for humans and nature.</p>
