            <h3>1. Environmental Pollution: The Invisible Legacy of Nuclear Accidents</h3>
            <p>The core issue of the Three Mile Island accident was the partial meltdown of the nuclear reactor core, leading to the leakage of a large amount of radioactive substances. Although most of the radioactive substances were contained within the nuclear plant, a small amount entered the atmosphere and water sources, which still had an undeniable impact on the local environment. After the accident, the nearby Susquehanna River became a potential pollution source. Although the radioactive levels in the river water did not reach dangerous standards, the panic caused by the accident led local residents to have long-term doubts about the safety of nuclear energy.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the accident resulted in radioactive contamination of the surrounding soil and vegetation. Although the contamination level was low, this "invisible legacy" serves as a reminder that the consequences of nuclear accidents are often slow and lasting. Decades later, scientists are still monitoring the ecosystem around Three Mile Island to assess the impact of the accident on wildlife and plant populations. Fortunately, the ecosystem of Three Mile Island was not catastrophically damaged by the accident, but this does not mean that the threat of environmental pollution has been completely eliminated.</p>

            <h3>2. Public Health: A Long-Unsolved Mystery</h3>
            <p>One of the most concerning issues for the public following the Three Mile Island accident was the impact of radioactive substance leakage on health. Although the accident did not result in any direct deaths, long-term epidemiological studies suggest that the accident may be associated with certain health issues. For example, the incidence of thyroid cancer among local residents increased in the years following the accident, although the association has not been conclusively proven, causing widespread concern.</p>
            <p>More importantly, the Three Mile Island accident exposed the inadequacies in public health monitoring after nuclear accidents. After the accident, authorities failed to provide the public with accurate information about radiation exposure in a timely manner, leading to panic and the spread of rumors. This information asymmetry not only exacerbated social distrust but also sounded the alarm for future nuclear accident responses. Today, nuclear energy management agencies place greater emphasis on transparency and public participation to ensure that accurate information can be conveyed promptly in the event of an accident.</p>

            <h3>3. Media Communication: The Game of Information Transparency and Public Trust</h3>
            <p>The Three Mile Island accident occurred during a period of rapid expansion in media influence, and nuclear energy technology was still a mysterious and unknown emerging technology for the public. Against this backdrop, the opacity of information, exaggerated media reporting, and the slow response from the government and experts together catalyzed a game of information transparency and public trust.</p>
            <p>Initially, the operator of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station, Metropolitan Edison, did not immediately inform the public of the severity of the accident. It was not until radiation monitoring data showed abnormalities that the government and media gradually intervened. However, due to a lack of systematic understanding of nuclear accidents, the early communication from the government and experts was hesitant and inconsistent. For example, a report received by the Governor of Pennsylvania stated that the nuclear reactor could "melt down," but the government did not immediately convey this information to the public. This opacity of information directly caused public panic.</p>
            <p>In the case of the Three Mile Island accident, the media was not only a disseminator of information but also a magnifying glass for public questioning of government transparency. Due to the specialized nature of nuclear energy technology, the public's reliance on the government was high, but the government's slow response and vague statements quickly transformed this reliance into distrust. For example, then-President Jimmy Carter visited the Three Mile Island nuclear plant and stated that "everything was under control." However, this statement was far from the reality and led to a sharp decline in public trust in the government.</p>

            <h3>4. Cultural Significance: The Global Nuclear Narrative from Fear to Reflection</h3>
            <p>The Three Mile Island accident was not just a regional disaster; it triggered a global discussion on nuclear energy technology, becoming a symbol of the relationship between nuclear energy technology and human future during the Cold War era. After the accident, the public began to question the safety and controllability of nuclear energy technology, and anti-nuclear movements quickly emerged. Nuclear energy, once a symbol of hope, transformed into a global symbol of fear.</p>
            <p>The Three Mile Island accident had a profound impact on the creation of science fiction literature and films. Before the accident, nuclear energy was often depicted in science fiction as a powerful tool that could drive human social progress. However, after the accident, nuclear energy gradually became a potential destructive force, symbolizing human technological失控 and uncertainty about the future. For example, the 1984 book "The Day After" depicts a post-nuclear war apocalyptic scenario, where the loss of control over nuclear energy is seen as a symbol of the collapse of human civilization. Similar works include the 1983 film "The Day After," which, set against the backdrop of the Three Mile Island accident, portrays the catastrophic impact of nuclear disasters on society.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Three Mile Island accident deeply influenced artistic creation. Many artists used their works to express reflections on nuclear energy and concern for the future of humanity. For example, German artist Joseph Beuys' 1982 work "7000 Oaks" symbolizes human hope for the future and reflections on nuclear energy through the planting of oak trees. This work is not only a cultural response to the Three Mile Island accident but also an artistic protest against global nuclear policies.</p>

            <h3>5. From History to the Future: The Evolution of Technological Advancements and Social Responses</h3>
            <p>From a historical perspective, the Three Mile Island accident became a watershed, marking significant changes in nuclear energy management and social response measures. Following the accident, the U.S. government strengthened the safety regulation of nuclear power plants and established stricter nuclear safety standards. For example, the "Nuclear Regulatory Commission" (NRC) introduced a "defense-in-depth" strategy to ensure that multiple layers of protection are in place to prevent core meltdown in the event of an accident. Additionally, automation and remote monitoring technologies in nuclear power plants have been significantly improved to reduce the possibility of human error.</p>
            <p>At the same time, social response measures have also evolved. After the Three Mile Island accident, nuclear energy management agencies placed greater emphasis on public participation and transparency, developing more comprehensive emergency response plans. For example, following the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan (2011), nuclear energy management agencies around the world learned from the lessons of Three Mile Island and further improved nuclear accident response mechanisms.</p>
            <p>However, technological advancements and social response measures still face challenges. Although the safety of modern nuclear power plants has significantly improved, the potential risks of nuclear accidents have not been completely eliminated. The future of nuclear energy depends not only on technological innovation but also on social understanding and trust. How to balance the economic benefits of nuclear energy with its potential risks, and how to build an effective global nuclear safety culture, are questions that still need to be explored through practice.</p>
