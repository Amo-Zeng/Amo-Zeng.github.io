**Surgical Treatment of Intrahepatic Stones: Open, Laparoscopic, and Hepatic Resection Approaches**

With the advancement of diagnostic techniques and surgical methods, the treatment of intrahepatic stones has evolved and improved. Intrahepatic stones account for approximately 20% of all liver stones, but the percentage varies in different countries and regions. The key to successful treatment is complete stone clearance, removal of the diseased bile ducts and affected liver tissue, and restoration of free biliary drainage and bile flow.

### 1. Indications for Surgery
- Repeated episodes of cholangitis with fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice.
- Obstruction of the bile ducts with associated cholestasis.
- Stones associated with strictures or malignancy.
- Presence of large stones not amenable to endoscopic or medical treatment.
- Liver atrophy or fibrosis caused by long-standing biliary obstruction.

### 2. Surgical Techniques
There are three main surgical approaches for the treatment of intrahepatic stones: open surgery, laparoscopic surgery, and hepatic resection.

#### 2.1 Open Surgery
Open surgery involves the use of a traditional incision, often through the right subcostal area. Once the liver and bile ducts are exposed, the stones can be removed under direct vision. This method allows for complete exploration of the biliary tree and is particularly useful when there is significant anatomical distortion due to previous surgeries or chronic inflammation.

#### 2.2 Laparoscopic Surgery
Laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive option that involves making small incisions and using specialized instruments to remove the stones. This method offers faster recovery and shorter hospital stays compared to open surgery. However, it may be technically challenging, especially in cases of complex stone distribution or biliary anatomy.

#### 2.3 Hepatic Resection
Hepatic resection may be required in cases of focal liver damage due to long-standing stone disease. This procedure involves removing the affected portion of the liver and is particularly effective when there is associated liver atrophy, fibrosis, or malignancy.

### 3. Postoperative Care
Proper postoperative care includes:
- Monitoring for complications such as bile leak, infection, or bleeding.
- Maintaining adequate nutrition and hydration.
- Regular follow-up imaging to assess for recurrence.

### 4. Outcomes and Complications
Overall, surgical treatment of intrahepatic stones is associated with high success rates, although recurrence can occur, especially if the underlying biliary disease is not fully addressed. Common complications include postoperative infection, bile leakage, and hepatic insufficiency.
