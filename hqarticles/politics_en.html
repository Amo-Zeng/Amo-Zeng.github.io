            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>With the rapid advancement of technology, the severity of environmental issues, and the deep exploration of psychological science, the field of political science is continuously expanding. New areas like digital democracy and cyber politics, environmental politics and ecological justice, and affective politics with cognitive science, not only offer unique perspectives for study but also intertwine in modern political participation and policy-making, shaping a complex political ecosystem.</p>

            <h3>Digital Democracy and Cyber Politics</h3>
            <h4>The Rise of Cyber Politics</h4>
            <p><strong>The Rise of Cyber Politics:</strong> The widespread use of the internet and social media has significantly increased the speed and scope of political information dissemination. Citizens can now participate in political activities more conveniently and broadly through online voting, e-petitions, and political mobilization on social media. Historic events like the "Arab Spring" and "Occupy Wall Street" have demonstrated the enormous potential and impact of cyber politics.</p>

            <h4>Practices and Challenges of Digital Democracy</h4>
            <p><strong>Practices and Challenges of Digital Democracy:</strong> The application of digital technology, like electronic voting and online petitions, enhances the transparency of democracy and public participation. For instance, Estonia's electronic voting system ensures election fairness through digital identity verification. However, digital democracy also faces challenges such as political polarization and the spread of misinformation. Social media algorithms might exacerbate echo chambers, leading to polarization of views, while fake news threatens the quality of democracy.</p>

            <h4>Response Strategies</h4>
            <p><strong>Response Strategies:</strong> To address these challenges, governments and society need to adopt multiple strategies, including establishing robust digital identity verification systems, developing smart algorithms to detect and filter misinformation, and collaborating with social media platforms. For example, the EU's "Action Plan Against Disinformation" is an attempt to combat misinformation through platform measures.</p>
