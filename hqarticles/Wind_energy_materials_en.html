            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the context of global energy structure transformation, wind energy, as a clean and renewable energy form, is increasingly being emphasized by countries around the world. The development of wind power technology not only promotes the optimization of the energy structure but also provides an important solution to address climate change. However, the efficiency, stability, and environmental friendliness of wind power are closely related to its core materials. From early wood and metal to modern composite materials and biomimetic designs, the evolution of wind energy materials not only reflects technological progress but also serves as a key driver of sustainable development. This article will explore the evolution of wind energy materials, technological breakthroughs, application prospects, and future development directions from the perspectives of materials science, biomimicry, and sustainable development.</p>

            <h3>Core Content</h3>
            <h4>I. Evolution of Key Technologies and Materials</h4>
            <h5>1. Early Stage: Application of Wood and Metal</h5>
            <p>Early wind turbines were relatively simple in design, primarily using wood and metal as materials. Wood, due to its lightweight and ease of processing, was widely used in the manufacture of wind wheels; metal was used for support structures and transmission systems. However, these materials had noticeable shortcomings in durability and corrosion resistance, limiting the long-term operational efficiency of wind turbines.</p>
            <h5>2. Middle Stage: Rise of Aluminum Alloy and Fiberglass</h5>
            <p>With technological advancements, aluminum alloy and fiberglass (glass-fiber reinforced plastic) began to replace wood and traditional metals. Aluminum alloy, with its high strength, lightweight, and excellent corrosion resistance, became one of the main materials for wind turbine blades; fiberglass, due to its excellent mechanical properties and low density, was widely used in the manufacturing of blades and nacelle covers. The application of these materials significantly improved the efficiency and lifespan of wind turbines.</p>
            <h5>3. Modern Stage: Innovation in Composite Materials and Advanced Alloys</h5>
            <p>Entering the 21st century, wind turbines have gradually shifted towards larger scale and offshore development, placing higher demands on materials. Carbon fiber reinforced composite materials, due to their exceptionally high strength-to-weight ratio and fatigue resistance, have become the preferred material for new wind turbine blades; meanwhile, the application of corrosion-resistant alloys and nanomaterials has further enhanced the reliability of wind turbines in harsh environments.</p>
            <h4>II. Application of Biomimicry in Wind Energy Material Design</h4>
            <h5>1. Concept and Significance of Biomimicry</h5>
            <p>Biomimicry is the study of natural biological structures, functions, and behaviors to apply them in human technological innovation. After millions of years of evolution, many organisms have developed intricate structures and mechanisms that efficiently adapt to environments and optimize energy use. The core idea of biomimicry is "learning from nature," leveraging these biological characteristics to design more efficient, environmentally friendly, and reliable artificial systems.</p>
            <h5>2. Key Technologies of Biomimicry in Wind Energy Material Design</h5>
            <p>The application of biomimicry in wind energy material design covers several key technical areas, mainly including the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blade Shape Optimization</strong>: Through biomimetic research, blades with hawk-wing structures can be designed, mimicking the characteristics of hawks reducing air resistance during flight, thereby improving wind energy conversion efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Material Surface Modification</strong>: Microstructures similar to shark skin can reduce air friction and improve material durability.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Material Design</strong>: Mimicking the mechanism of sunflowers, devices capable of automatically adjusting their shape according to wind direction and speed can be designed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>III. From "Green" to "Greener": Sustainable Development of Wind Energy Materials</h4>
            <h5>1. Sustainable Development of Blade Materials</h5>

In recent years, researchers have increasingly turned to more environmentally friendly materials, such as carbon fiber reinforced composite materials and natural fiber reinforced composite materials.</p>
            <h5>2. Sustainable Development of Tower Materials</h5>
            <p>Traditional wind turbine towers mostly use steel. In recent years, aluminum alloy and fiber reinforced composite materials have gradually come into focus.</p>
            <h5>3. Sustainable Development of Bearing Materials</h5>
            <p>Traditional bearing materials mostly use steel. In recent years, ceramic bearing materials have gradually gained attention.</p>
            <h4>IV. Application Areas and Prospects</h4>
            <h5>1. Onshore Wind Power</h5>
            <p>By optimizing blade materials and overall structures, the capacity and annual power generation of onshore wind turbines have been continuously increasing, with costs significantly reduced.</p>
            <h5>2. Offshore Wind Power</h5>
            <p>Advanced corrosion-resistant materials and composite material technologies provide important support for the development of offshore wind power.</p>
            <h5>3. Distributed Wind Power</h5>
