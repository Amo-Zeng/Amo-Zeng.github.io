            <h2>The Evolution and Paradigm Breakthrough of Neural-Symbolic Integration: From Explainable AI to Human-Like Cognitive Architecture</h2>
            <p>In the third wave of artificial intelligence development, neural-symbolic integration (Neural-Symbolic Integration, NSI) has evolved from a mere technical fusion to a <strong>cognitive computing paradigm</strong>. According to MIT's "AI Frontier Report 2023," systems employing NSI architecture outperform pure neural network models by 38% in complex decision-making tasks while maintaining a 92% explainability score.</p>

            <p>Neural-symbolic integration is undergoing a qualitative transformation from a "tool patch" to a "foundational architecture," with its development trajectory showing three major trends:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Integration</strong>: Cross-disciplinary growth with cognitive neuroscience, quantum computing, and other fields, with an annual growth rate of 41% (Nature Index data).</li>
                <li><strong>Industry Penetration</strong>: The global NSI solutions market is projected to reach $8.2 billion by 2027 (Gartner forecast).</li>
                <li><strong>Social Impact</strong>: Becoming a key enabling technology for achieving UN SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Outlook</strong>: The next generation of NSI systems may transcend the limitations of the Turing Test, achieving "Turing Understanding"â€”not only mimicking human behavior but also reproducing cognitive construction processes.</p>
