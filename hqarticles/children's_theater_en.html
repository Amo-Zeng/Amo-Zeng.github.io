            <h2>Stage and Games: Arenas for Emotion and Thought</h2>
            <p>Throughout the course of human civilization, the stage and games have always been arenas for emotion and thought, key forces in shaping individuals and society. From ancient Greek theater to modern digital games, these seemingly different forms collectively construct a complex "brain-building" process. Through emotional resonance, social cognition, and creativity, they shape future citizens.</p>

            <h3>1. Brain-Building on Stage: The Intersection of Emotion and Cognition</h3>
            <p>The stage is a laboratory for emotion and thought. Actors transform abstract emotions and complex thoughts into concrete actions through performance. This transformation is driven by highly coordinated and creative brain activity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identity Reconstruction</strong>: When actors step into a role, the prefrontal cortex processes self-awareness, while the hippocampus helps retrieve background information about the character.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Resonance and Mirror Neurons</strong>: Through the activation of mirror neurons, actors experience the emotional fluctuations of the character and convey them to the audience through emotional resonance.</li>
                <li><strong>Improvisation and Creativity</strong>: Improvisation in theater is the neural basis of creativity. Actors develop their creative skills through improvisational training.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Social Experimentation: Shaping the Values of Future Citizens</h3>
            <p>Children's theater is not merely entertainment; it is a profound social experimentation arena. By fostering multicultural integration, cultivating civic awareness, and practicing cooperation and communication, it shapes the values of future citizens.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multicultural Integration</strong>: Children's theater provides a window for kids to encounter diverse cultures, nurturing their open-world perspective.</li>
                <li><strong>Civic Awareness and Social Responsibility</strong>: Through exploring social issues, theater sparks children's interest and critical thinking about societal problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Practicing Cooperation and Communication</strong>: Theater performance is a collective art. Children learn to listen, understand, and coordinate with others during performances.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The stage and games are not only arenas for testing emotions and thoughts but also forges shaping future citizens. In the future, theater and games will continue to play a crucial role in shaping human emotion, cognition, and creativity, helping us co-write a more diverse, innovative, and inclusive future.</p>
