            <h2>From Linguistic Theory to AI Applications</h2>
            <p>Throughout the history of linguistic research, the "Agent-centered Theory" has long dominated our understanding of sentence structure and semantic roles. This theory firmly asserts that the agent, as the initiator and controller of actions, holds an undisputed dominant position in both semantics and syntax. However, as linguistic theories have evolved and real-world language phenomena have been studied in depth, we have gradually come to recognize that the centrality of agents is not unshakable. The projection of semantic roles can undergo significant changes in different sentence patterns and contexts. This realization not only challenges traditional linguistic theories but also provides new dimensions for natural language understanding (NLU) models in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

            <h3>Limitations of Agent-centered Theory and the Rise of Non-canonical Agents</h3>
            <p>The core of the Agent-centered Theory lies in treating the agent as the primary driving force of a sentence, which is particularly effective in analyzing active sentences. For example, in the sentence "John kicked the ball," "John" as the agent is clearly the initiator of the action "kicked," and its dominant position in syntax and semantics is unquestioned. However, when we turn to passive sentences, causative sentences, or other complex sentence patterns, the central position of the agent begins to be challenged.</p>
            <p>In the passive sentence "The ball was kicked by John," although the agent "John" remains the initiator of the action, its syntactic status has been weakened, and the recipient of the action "the ball" has become the subject of the sentence. This shift in sentence pattern demonstrates that the central role of the agent is not unassailable, and the projection of semantic roles can undergo significant changes in different sentence patterns.</p>
            <p>Non-canonical agents refer to roles that are not considered typical agents under the framework of the traditional Agent-centered Theory. These roles may include tools, environmental factors, or even abstract concepts. For example, in the sentence "The wind broke the window," "the wind" as the agent is not a traditional initiator of actions but a natural phenomenon. However, from the perspective of semantic role projection, "the wind" still functions as an agent, albeit with weaker agentivity. Similarly, in the sentence "The policy led to economic growth," "the policy" as an abstract concept also serves as an agent, albeit in a more indirect and abstract manner.</p>
            <p>The rise of non-canonical agents reflects the diversity and flexibility of language use. In actual language communication, we often need to express actions or events that are not initiated by traditional agents. This diversity indicates that the definition and projection of semantic roles are not static but deeply influenced by context and sentence structure.</p>

            <h3>Semantic Role Projection and Cognitive Metaphor: Bridging Language and Thought</h3>
            <p>Semantic Role Projection is the process of mapping semantic roles (such as agents, patients, tools, etc.) onto syntactic structures. Under the traditional Agent-centered Theory framework, the projection of agents is often direct and explicit, while in the context of non-canonical agents, this projection becomes more complex and implicit.</p>
            <p>For example, in the sentence "The hammer broke the glass," "the hammer" as a tool assumes the role of an agent. This projection is not based on the agent's initiative but on its crucial role in the realization of the action. This diversity in projection methods indicates that the definition and projection of semantic roles are not static but deeply influenced by context and cognitive frameworks.</p>
            <p>The rise of non-canonical agents is closely related to cognitive metaphor. Cognitive metaphor is the cognitive process of mapping one conceptual domain (the source domain) to another (the target domain). For example, in the sentence "The wind broke the window," "the wind" can become an agent because we metaphorically view it as a powerful entity capable of initiating actions. This metaphorical projection allows non-canonical agents to be widely used in language expression.</p>
            <p>The combination of semantic role projection and cognitive metaphor provides a bridge from language to thought. Language is not merely a monologue of agents but a complex multidimensional cognitive mapping process. Through semantic role projection, we can map abstract cognitive concepts to concrete language expressions; through cognitive metaphor, we can project the characteristics of one conceptual domain onto another, thereby achieving the diversity and flexibility of language.</p>

            <h3>Semantic Role Projection and AI: Building More Accurate Natural Language Understanding Models</h3>
            <p>In the field of artificial intelligence, the construction of natural language understanding (NLU) models relies on the accurate identification and projection of semantic roles. Traditional NLU models often follow the Agent-centered Theory, treating the agent as the core of the sentence. However, with the rise of non-canonical agents, such models show limitations in handling complex sentence patterns and diverse language phenomena.</p>
            <p>To build more accurate NLU models, we need to incorporate a diversity of perspectives on semantic role projection. By identifying and processing non-canonical agents, models can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the semantic structure of sentences, thereby improving their ability to handle complex sentence patterns. For example, when processing the sentence "The wind broke the window," the model not only needs to identify "the wind" as an agent but also understand its non-canonical role in the realization of the action.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the diversity of semantic role projection can also help models better handle context dependency. In different contexts, the same semantic role may have different projection methods. For example, in the sentence "The policy led to economic growth," the projection method of "the policy" as an agent differs from traditional agents, and the model needs to dynamically adjust based on the context.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The rise of non-canonical agents marks a new stage in linguistic research. The limitations of the Agent-centered Theory are increasingly evident when faced with complex and varied language phenomena, while the diversity of semantic role projection provides new perspectives and methods for our research. By breaking away from the Agent-centered Theory, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the semantic structure of language and explore the essence of language use and understanding more deeply.</p>
            <p>In the field of artificial intelligence, the diversity of semantic role projection offers new ideas for building more accurate NLU models. By identifying and processing non-canonical agents, models can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the semantic structure of sentences, thereby improving their ability to handle complex sentence patterns. The deepening of this research direction is bound to have a profound impact on the development of linguistic theories and practical applications, as well as bringing new breakthroughs to natural language processing technology in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
