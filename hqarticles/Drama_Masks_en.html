            <h2>I. Dispelling the Myth of "Reality": Has the Mask Set the Soul of Performance Free?</h2>
            <p>Since its inception, performing arts has been closely linked to "reality." Should actors "truly" portray their characters, and can audiences gain emotional resonance through "real" performances? These questions have been at the heart of controversies in theatre history. The mask, as a special performance tool, provides a new perspective on this issue: by stripping away the "reality" of appearances, the mask may liberate the actor's soul and introduce a new dimension to performance.</p>
            <h3>The Application and Significance of Masks in Ancient Greek Tragedy</h3>
            <p>Masks played a crucial role in ancient Greek theatre, especially in tragic performances. With audiences in large outdoor theatres, actors' voices and expressions were difficult to convey clearly. Masks solved this problem, with two main functions: amplifying the actor's voice through the mask's resonance chamber to ensure it reached the audience, and altering the actor's appearance to help the audience quickly identify the character's identity, emotions, and personality.</p>
            <h3>The Application and Significance of Masks in Modern Theatre: "Madagascar"</h3>
            <p>Modern theatre has gradually broken away from the traditional framework of "realistic" performance. Bertolt Brecht's theory of the "alienation effect" emphasized deliberately breaking the fourth wall to create a distance between the audience and the stage, allowing the audience to maintain a rational critical attitude and reflect deeper on the plot and social reality. Brecht's ideas have been continuously practiced in modern theatre, and the use of masks is one of the most representative methods.</p>
            <h3>How Masks Influence Audience and Actor Experiences Through the "Alienation Effect"</h3>
            <p>The special function of masks in performing arts lies not only in their appearance and sound but also in the "alienation effect" they create. The "alienation effect" breaks the emotional bond between the audience and the actor, preventing the audience from directly feeling the character's emotions and allowing them to think more rationally about the social and philosophical issues behind the plot.</p>
            <h3>Does the Mask Provide Another Possibility for Performance, Liberating the Actor's Body Language?</h3>
            <p>The use of masks not only changes the audience's experience but also offers new possibilities for the actor's performance. By covering the actor's facial expressions, masks force them to rely more on body language and voice to convey emotions and character states. This performance method makes the actor's body a more significant tool for expression, thereby liberating their body language.</p>

            <h2>II. The Ambiguity of Masks: A Carnival of Multiple Interpretations</h2>
            <p>As a symbol, masks inherently carry rich cultural connotations and symbolic meanings. They are like a mirror, reflecting the multiple dimensions of identity, the deep spectrum of emotions, and becoming an intriguing window for interpreting human nature.</p>
            <h3>How Masks Hide and Reveal Identity</h3>
            <p>The existence of masks is a philosophical discussion about identity. They are both a concealment and a revelation, navigating this seeming contradiction with ease. In ancient Greek tragedy, the masks worn by actors allowed the same character to convey emotions and enabled different actors to portray the same role.</p>
            <h3>How Masks Suppress and Release Emotions</h3>
            <p>When a mask is worn, emotions also enter a fascinating polyphonic state. During carnival festivals, people can laugh and dance freely under the mask, sweeping away their daily suppression. Mikhail Bakhtin called this state "carnivalesque," freeing emotions from the constraints of daily discipline and allowing them to soar freely in the sky of imagination.</p>
            <h3>How Masks Become a Window for Audience Interpretation</h3>
            <p>Masks are also a gateway to infinite interpretations. They invite the audience to participate in the exploration of human nature, seeking answers in endless possibilities. In Shakespeare's "Macbeth," when the protagonist wears Duncan's mask, we see not only a misplacement of identity but also a fierce collision between desire and morality.</p>

            <h2>III. Masks Under Technological Innovation: A New Experience in Performance in the Digital Age</h2>
            <p>In contemporary society, the rapid development of technology has not only changed our way of life but also profoundly affected the forms of art and performance. As an ancient performance medium, masks, under the context of the digital age, have been revitalized through technological innovations such as virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI), and 3D printing.</p>
            <h3>The Combination of Virtual Reality (VR) Technology and Masks: Immersive Theatre Experience</h3>
            <p>The rise of virtual reality technology has brought audiences an unprecedented theatre experience. When VR technology is combined with masks, the audience is no longer a passive spectator but can truly "enter" the performance world.</p>
            <h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Driven Dynamic Masks: A Richer Performance Tool</h3>
            <p>The introduction of artificial intelligence has infused masks with new vitality, turning them from static decorations into intelligent devices that can dynamically change with emotions and剧情.</p>
            <h3>3D Printing Technology: Precision and Personalization in Mask Making</h3>
            <p>The popularity of 3D printing technology has made mask-making more precise and personalized. Traditional mask-making often relies on manual carving and mold-making, with long production cycles and difficulty in achieving large-scale personalized customization.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>From ancient Greek tragedy to modern theatre, and finally to technological innovations in the digital age, the application of masks in performing arts has undergone a transformation from a practical tool to a symbolic medium. Masks are no longer merely a solution to technical performance issues but have become a tool for changing the experiences of both the audience and the actor.</p>
