            <h2>Group Polarization and the Decline in Decision Quality: A Perspective from Decision Science</h2>
            <p>Group polarization refers to the phenomenon where the views of group members tend to become more extreme during group discussions. This phenomenon not only affects the harmony within the group but, more importantly, has a profound impact on the quality of group decisions. This article will explore from the perspective of decision science how group polarization leads to a decline in decision quality and analyze its potential dangers.</p>
