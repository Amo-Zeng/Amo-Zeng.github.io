            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the historical flow, every era has its unique blueprint of dreams. These dreams not only carry the hopes of the nation but also outline the future of the state. From the "Self-Strengthening Dream" of the late Qing Dynasty to the "Liberation Dream" of the Republic of China, and then to the "Prosperity Dream" of the early People's Republic, until the modern "Chinese Dream," the changes in form and content of these visions reflect profound thinking and unremitting pursuit of China in different historical stages. This article will analyze these national development visions from different periods to explore how the "Chinese Dream" serves as a phased goal in the modernization process, summarizing historical experiences and looking forward to future development. Additionally, this article will delve into the role of the "Chinese Dream" in shaping individual values and social stratification, as well as its transformation in global governance, showing how the "Chinese Dream" interacts and integrates with the dreams of other countries under the background of globalization to jointly promote social progress.</p>

            <h2>I. National Dreams in Historical Evolution</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>The "Self-Strengthening Dream" of the Late Qing Dynasty: Awakening in Crisis</h3>
                    <p>In the mid-19th century, the invasion of Western powers plunged China into an unprecedented crisis. Against this backdrop, the late Qing government and a group of intellectuals began to advocate the idea of "self-strengthening," attempting to save the country from peril by learning Western technology and systems. The "Self-Strengthening Dream" of this period was mainly embodied in the practice of the Self-Strengthening Movement, targeting military and economic modernization. Although this dream was not fully realized for various reasons, it marked the beginning of China's modernization process and laid the foundation for future development.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>The "Liberation Dream" of the Republic of China: Calls for Democracy and Science</h3>
                    <p>After the Revolution of 1911, the establishment of the Republic of China shifted the national development vision to "liberation." Intellectuals and politicians of this era called for democracy and science, trying to achieve national independence and ethnic liberation through political reforms and social progress. The May Fourth Movement, as a landmark event of this period, proposed the slogan of "Mr. Democracy" and "Mr. Science," becoming an integral part of the "Liberation Dream." Although the dream of liberation in the Republic of China was not completely realized in the turbulent political environment, it had a profound impact on later political and social changes.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>The "Prosperity Dream" of the Early People's Republic: Exploration of Socialism</h3>
                    <p>After the founding of New China, the vision of national development shifted to "prosperity." Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country was committed to achieving rapid economic development and national strength through the socialist path. Although this process encountered numerous twists and challenges, the core idea of the "Prosperity Dream"—to achieve national modernization through collectivism and planned economy—laid the foundation for later reform and opening up.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>"The Chinese Dream": A Phased Goal of Modernization</h3>
                    <p>Entering the 21st century, China proposed the "Chinese Dream" as a new national development vision. Compared with the "Self-Strengthening Dream," "Liberation Dream," and "Prosperity Dream" of the past, the "Chinese Dream" not only inherits the historical experiences of the predecessors but also emphasizes more on its contemporaneity and inclusiveness. It emphasizes not only the rejuvenation of the nation but also individual happiness and the nation's position on the global stage. The proposal of this dream marks a new stage in China's modernization process, aiming to achieve comprehensive economic, social, and cultural development through deepening reforms and innovation-driven strategies.</p>

            <h2>II. The Individual Dimension of the Chinese Dream: Pursuit of Diverse Values and Social Stratum Mobility</h2>
            <p>As a grand blueprint at the national level, the "Chinese Dream" encompasses not only the development of the nation and the rejuvenation of the ethnic group but also a deep connection with the destiny of every individual. Against this national aspiration, the shaping of individual values and the mobility of social strata present unprecedented complexity and diversity.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>The Chinese Dream and the Shaping of Individual Values</h3>
                    <p>The "Chinese Dream" is not only a national vision but also a cultural atmosphere that motivates individuals to pursue their personal dreams. Under this atmosphere, individual values have undergone significant changes. Sociological studies show that values are crucial psychological factors guiding individual actions, and the "Chinese Dream" has profoundly influenced people's value orientations through media, education, policies, and multiple channels.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pursuit of Self-Actualization</strong>: The Chinese Dream emphasizes the combination of personal dreams with national dreams, leading more and more people to focus on self-actualization. Whether through educational improvement, career development, or entrepreneurship to achieve financial freedom, individuals are pursuing higher levels of self-value.</li>
                        <li><strong>Enhancement of Social Responsibility</strong>: The Chinese Dream encourages not only personal success but also social responsibility. Under this value guidance, individuals not only pursue maximum personal benefits but also begin to pay attention to the overall social interests and public welfare. This change is particularly evident among the younger generation, who are more focused on balancing social contributions with personal achievements.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Social Stratum Mobility Inspired by the Chinese Dream</h3>
                    <p>As a national vision, the core of the "Chinese Dream" lies in achieving comprehensive social progress and individual development. Under the impetus of this vision, social mobility presents new characteristics.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Expansion of Educational Opportunities</strong>: Education is a crucial path to social mobility. During the implementation of the "Chinese Dream," the fair distribution of educational resources has become a policy priority. By improving the quality of education in rural and impoverished areas and lowering the entry threshold for higher education, the government provides more people with opportunities for upward mobility.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rise of the Entrepreneurial Boom</strong>: The "Chinese Dream" encourages innovation and entrepreneurship, providing a broad platform for aspiring individuals. Policy support, funding assistance, and the optimization of the entrepreneurial environment have led more and more young people to choose entrepreneurship as a means to achieve social stratification.</li>
                        <li><strong>Diversification of Career Choices</strong>: Under the guidance of the "Chinese Dream," career choices are no longer limited to traditional stable positions but show a diversified trend. From the internet industry to cultural and creative industries, from scientific research to social services, diverse career options provide more development opportunities for individuals from different backgrounds.</li>
                    </ul>

            <ol>
                <li><h3>The Globalization Context of the Chinese Dream</h3>
                    <p>The origin of the "Chinese Dream" can be traced back to the ancient Silk Road, where China's exchanges with other regions of the world began. With the deepening of globalization, the "Chinese Dream" is no longer merely a national dream but has become an integral part of the world dream. The connotation of the "Chinese Dream" has gradually expanded, encompassing not only the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation but also active participation in and the promotion of building a community with a shared future for mankind.</p>

China actively participates in international organizations and multilateral mechanisms, promoting the reform and improvement of the global economic governance system through initiatives such as the Belt and Road and regional economic cooperation. China's participation not only enhances its influence on the international stage but also provides new ideas and solutions for global governance.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Belt and Road Initiative</strong>: As an important measure to promote the globalization process, the Belt and Road Initiative aims to promote economic development in countries along the route through infrastructure construction and trade investment. The "Chinese Dream" is fully reflected in this initiative, promoting the formation of an open, inclusive, balanced, and beneficial regional economic cooperation framework through the principles of consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits.</li>
                        <li><strong>Regional Economic Cooperation</strong>: China actively participates in the regional economic integration process, promoting the establishment of new multilateral financial institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).

                        <li><strong>Global Climate Governance</strong>: As a responsible major country, China plays an important role in global climate governance. The realization of the "Chinese Dream" not only requires sustainable development of the domestic economy but also promotes green development on a global scale. China actively participates in international climate cooperation such as the Paris Agreement, promoting global efforts to address climate change.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><h3>The Interaction and Integration of the Chinese Dream with Other National Dreams</h3>
                    <p>In the context of globalization, the "Chinese Dream" and the dreams of other countries are not isolated but mutually influential and integrated. Through dialogue, exchange, and cooperation, national dreams can be jointly realized, promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cultural Exchange and Mutual Learning</strong>: The mutual learning of civilizations between the "Chinese Dream" and the dreams of other countries and regions enhances understanding and respect among different civilizations. Through cultural exchanges, educational cooperation, and other means, the "Chinese Dream" and the dreams of other countries can harmoniously coexist and achieve diversity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Economic Win-Win</strong>: The integration of the "Chinese Dream" and the dreams of other countries at the economic level promotes global economic development. Through trade, investment, technological innovation, and other means, the "Chinese Dream" and the dreams of other countries form mutual complementarity and achieve win-win results.</li>
                        <li><strong>Global Responsibility</strong>: The realization of the "Chinese Dream" requires China to undertake more global responsibilities and promote the establishment of a fair and reasonable international order. Through participation in global governance, providing global public goods, and other means, China demonstrates a great power's sense of responsibility and promotes world peace and development.</li>
                    </ul>
