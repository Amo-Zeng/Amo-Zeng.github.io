            <h2>Data Ethics and Social Responsibility</h2>
            <p>In the digital age, data has become a key resource driving social progress and economic development. However, with the widespread application of data, issues of data ethics, social responsibility, and management complexity have become increasingly prominent. Data stewardship, as a critical component in ensuring data quality and security, not only needs to focus on technical issues but should also consider ethical, social responsibility, and interdisciplinary integration perspectives to ensure that data usage does not exacerbate social inequality, infringe on personal privacy, or be used for discriminatory decisions. This article will explore the importance and practical approaches of data stewardship from the dimensions of data ethics and social responsibility, interdisciplinary integration, and intelligence.</p>
            <h3>1. The Necessity of Data Ethics</h3>
            <p>Data ethics refers to adhering to certain moral norms and ethical principles in the processes of data collection, processing, analysis, and application, ensuring that data usage does not have negative impacts on individuals and society. The core of data ethics lies in balancing the benefits of data utilization with potential risks, ensuring that data usage aligns with the general values of society.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Protecting Personal Privacy:</strong> The collection and use of personal data must respect individual privacy rights, ensuring that the processes of data collection and processing are transparent, legal, and fair. Data stewards should ensure that user consent is explicitly obtained during data collection and implement necessary technical measures to protect data security, preventing data breaches and misuse.</li>
                <li><strong>Preventing Discriminatory Decisions:</strong> Data-driven decisions should avoid discrimination based on sensitive attributes such as race, gender, religion, and age. Data stewards should establish mechanisms to review datasets and algorithm models, ensuring they do not contain biases or discriminatory elements, promoting a fair and inclusive social environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting Data Transparency:</strong> The process of data usage should be transparent, ensuring that the public can understand the sources, processing methods, and purposes of data usage. Data stewards should promote data transparency by establishing data usage reporting mechanisms, enhancing public trust in data usage.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Manifestation of Social Responsibility</h3>
            <p>Data stewardship not only needs to focus on ethical issues but should also take on social responsibilities to ensure that data usage promotes sustainable social development.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Promoting Social Equity:</strong> Data usage should help reduce social inequality and promote social equity. Data stewards should pay attention to the social impact of data usage, ensuring that data usage does not exacerbate social inequality but helps solve social problems and improve social well-being.</li>
                <li><strong>Supporting Sustainable Development:</strong> Data usage should support sustainable development goals, such as environmental protection and resource conservation. Data stewards should encourage and support the application of data in areas like environmental protection and climate change, promoting sustainable social development.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Public Participation:</strong> Data usage should enhance public participation, ensuring that the processes and outcomes of data usage can be supervised and evaluated by the public. Data stewards should establish public participation mechanisms, encouraging the public to provide feedback and suggestions on data usage, enhancing social oversight of data usage.</li>
            </ul>
