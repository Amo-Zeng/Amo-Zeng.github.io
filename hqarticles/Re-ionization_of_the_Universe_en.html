                <p>In the 13.8-billion-year epic of cosmic evolution, the reionization era (redshift z≈6-20, approximately 300 million to 1 billion years after the Big Bang) was like a magnificent cosmic dawn. This 700-million-year photon revolution not only tore through the dark veil of neutral hydrogen but also used radiation as a chisel to shape the cosmic web and galaxy walls we observe today. With the help of next-generation space telescopes and million-core-level numerical simulations, humanity has finally been able to decode this pivotal transformation that shaped the universe.</p>

                <h3>I. The Cosmic Cycle of Darkness and Light</h3>
                <p>As the afterglow of the Big Bang (the cosmic microwave background) gradually cooled, the primordial plasma recombined into neutral hydrogen, plunging the universe into a 400-million-year "dark age." During this seemingly silent period, seeds of change were being nurtured in dark matter halos—density fluctuations caused by quantum variations, cradled by gravity, gave birth to the universe's first generation of stars (Population III stars). These blue giants, hundreds of times more massive than the Sun, emitted their first ionizing photons at a rate of 10⁴⁹ photons per second upon their birth.</p>
                <p>Recent hydrodynamic simulations (such as IllustrisTNG) reveal that these stars were not randomly scattered but were distributed along the dark matter filament network in a node-like pattern. The ionized bubbles they created spread through the universe like ink drops on rice paper, forming a fractal structure (fractal dimension D≈2.7). Observations from the Australian SKA Pathfinder telescope at 21 cm show that by redshift z≈6, these bubbles had covered over 95% of the universe's volume, raising the electron temperature from 10K to 10⁴K and completing a quantum leap in the state of cosmic matter.</p>

                <h3>II. The Dynamic Weaving of the Cosmic Web</h3>
                <p>Reionization was not merely a photon bombardment but a cosmic-scale feedback system intricately coupled with structure formation:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Topological Evolution</strong><br>
                        The ionization fronts propagated anisotropically under the guidance of dark matter filaments, increasing the connectivity between galaxy clusters by 40% (Euclid satellite data). This explains the origin of the "node-filament-void" triad in the modern cosmic web.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mass Screening</strong><br>
                        The ultraviolet background radiation (J₀≈10⁻²¹ erg/s/Hz/cm²/sr) formed a photon barrier, truncating gas accretion in dark halos below 10⁸M☉. Hydrodynamic simulations show that this reduced the predicted number of dwarf galaxies by 70%, perfectly explaining the missing satellite problem in the Local Group.</li>
                    <li><strong>Metal Seeding</strong><br>
                        Population III supernovae injected heavy elements into the ionized channels with energies of 10⁵¹erg. JWST discovered a carbon-enriched region ([C/H]≈-1.2) spanning 300 kpc around the GN-z11 galaxy at redshift z≈8.3, confirming early metal diffusion models.</li>

                <h3>III. Multidimensional Perspectives of the Time Machine</h3>
                <p>Modern cosmology constructs a three-dimensional image of reionization through multi-messenger observations:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Detection Method</th>
                        <th>Key Discovery</th>
                        <th>Breakthrough Instrument</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>21 cm Tomography</td>
                        <td>Neutral hydrogen distribution shows a bubble structure (HERA array)</td>
                        <td>South Africa's MeerKAT</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Lyman-α Forest</td>
                        <td>Photon mean free path increases sharply at redshift z=5.7</td>
                        <td>Hubble's COS Spectrograph</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Galaxy UV Luminosity</td>
                        <td>Galaxy density at z≈12 exceeds ΛCDM predictions by 5 times</td>
                        <td>JWST NIRCam</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>Notably, China's FAST telescope detected a 21 cm absorption line at redshift z≈17 in 2023, revealing a "temperature trough" in the early stages of reionization, forcing theoretical models to incorporate new feedback mechanisms.</p>

                <h3>IV. Unsolved Mysteries and Future Exploration</h3>
                <p>At the frontier of knowledge, we face three major challenges:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The Debate on Ionization Sources</strong><br>
                        The contribution of quasars remains controversial, with JWST's latest spectral analysis suggesting they may account for 15±5%, much higher than earlier estimates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dark Matter Coupling Effects</strong><br>
                        Axion dark matter models predict that ionization fronts propagate 15% faster than in cold dark matter models, which could be verified by SKA Phase 1 arrays.</li>
                    <li><strong>Magnetic Field Amplification Mechanisms</strong><br>
                        The role of Alfvén waves in the merging of ionized bubbles may explain the origin of μG-level magnetic fields in modern galaxy clusters.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In the next decade, with the commissioning of instruments like SKA (sensitivity of 1μJy) and the Roman Space Telescope (field of view 100deg²), along with exaFLOP-level supercomputers (such as Frontier) for cosmological simulations, humanity will for the first time map the complete four-dimensional reionization landscape. As Nobel laureate Peebles predicted, "Unraveling the mystery of reionization is the golden key to connecting quantum fluctuations with galaxy formation."</p>
