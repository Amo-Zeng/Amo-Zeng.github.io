            <h2>Integration of Smart Technology with Cleaning Tools</h2>
            <p>Traditional cleaning tools like brooms, mops, and cloths have remained largely unchanged in form, but their functions are being empowered by smart technology. For example, smart robotic vacuum cleaners equipped with advanced sensors and algorithms can autonomously plan cleaning routes, avoid obstacles, and even return to charge when low on power. The advent of these robots not only eases the burden of household chores but also enhances cleaning efficiency and quality.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Personalized and Adaptive Cleaning Solutions</h2>
            <p>Another significant feature of smart technology is its ability to provide personalized and adaptive cleaning solutions. By learning users' habits and preferences, smart cleaning devices can adjust their operating modes to achieve optimal cleaning results. For instance, certain smart toilets can automatically adjust the temperature and strength of the rinse water based on individual hygiene habits, offering a more private and comfortable cleaning experience.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Environmental Perception and Intelligent Decision Making</h2>
            <p>Future cleaning tools will possess more advanced environmental perception capabilities, able to monitor air quality, humidity, and particle concentrations in real-time, thereby making intelligent decisions. For example, smart air purifiers can adjust their operating status based on indoor and outdoor air quality data to ensure the indoor air is always in the best condition. This enhancement in intelligent decision-making allows cleaning tools to more proactively maintain our living environment.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Energy Efficiency and Sustainability</h2>
            <p>The application of smart technology in cleaning tools also promotes the enhancement of energy efficiency and the practice of sustainability. Smart appliances typically come with energy management systems that monitor and optimize energy use, reducing unnecessary waste. For instance, smart dishwashers precisely control water temperature and washing time, ensuring cleaning effectiveness while significantly reducing water and electricity consumption.</p>
