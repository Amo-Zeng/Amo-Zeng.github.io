            <h3>I. Intelligent Monitoring and Maintenance: Deep Application of AI Technology</h3>
            <h4>1. Real-time Data Collection and Analysis:</h4>
            <p>Modern machine tools are integrated with various high-precision sensors capable of capturing rich data in real time. This data, processed and analyzed through advanced AI algorithms, can accurately predict the health of equipment. For example, by analyzing vibration data, AI systems can predict bearing wear before it leads to failure, enabling predictive maintenance which significantly reduces downtime and maintenance costs.</p>
            <h4>2. Energy Consumption Optimization and Equipment Lifespan Extension:</h4>
            <p>AI technology optimizes energy usage by monitoring and analyzing consumption data, reducing unnecessary waste. Simultaneously, AI can adjust operational parameters like cutting force and feed rate in real-time to extend tool life and enhance overall equipment efficiency.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>II. Modular Design: A New Era of Flexibility and Adaptability</h3>
            <h4>1. Achieving Flexible Production:</h4>
            <p>Modular design allows machines to adapt to diverse production needs by quickly changing modules. For instance, a machine can switch from processing small parts to handling large, complex components in minutes, enhancing production line flexibility, reducing idle time, and investment costs.</p>
            <h4>2. Reducing Maintenance and Upgrade Costs:</h4>
            <p>Modular design makes equipment maintenance more efficient; when a module fails, only that module needs replacing rather than the entire machine. Additionally, technological upgrades become simpler as they can be implemented by replacing specific modules, avoiding large-scale equipment overhauls.</p>
