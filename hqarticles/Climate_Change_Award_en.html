                <p>When global climate award ceremonies conclude amidst flashing lights, we rarely question: do these "solutions" truly address the essence of the climate crisis? Why are more and more awards criticized as "green showcases"? Why do technological breakthroughs keep emerging while the ecological crisis continues to worsen? The answer lies not in the technology itself, but in the <strong>structure of discourse power</strong> behind these awards—climate awards are no longer just recognition mechanisms but power machines defining "what constitutes climate action." However, this machinery is deeply entrenched in three structural ruptures: <strong>knowledge exclusion, capital collusion, and emotional absence</strong>. Only by breaking these three shackles can climate awards potentially shift from "tool recognition" to "civilization restructuring ceremonies."</p>

                <h3>I. Knowledge Rupture: Exclusion of Local Wisdom under Global Standards</h3>
                <p>Climate awards have long used Western scientific paradigms as the sole criterion, equating "effectiveness" with "quantifiability, replicability, and capitalizability." Local knowledge passed down for millennia—such as the "water eye" water-finding technique in Africa's Sahel, adaptive stilt houses in Bangladesh, and the "Pachamama" crop rotation system in the Andes—has hardly ever entered the mainstream award arena. Anthropologist Arturo Escobar points out that modern science often treats local knowledge as "pre-modern remnants," while packaging itself as "universal truth." The judging criteria of awards—technological maturity, carbon reduction data, return on investment—are essentially a form of <strong>scientific colonialism</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>A deeper issue is that this exclusion serves a technocentric view of climate governance. We are told that the crisis can only be solved by carbon capture, AI models, and renewable energy engineering. Local practices—such as community co-management, restraint, and rotational grazing—are deemed "non-transformative." The UN's "2023 Adaptation Gap Report" reveals: locally-led adaptation measures cover 80% of vulnerable populations but receive only 10% of funding. Awards, as "legitimizing institutions," not only fail to correct this imbalance but reinforce the knowledge hierarchy. For example, an African solar project won an award, but the "water guardianship system"传承 (chuánchéng - passed down) by female elders was ignored—the award recognized the technology but discarded the culture and system.</p>
                
                <p>The way out lies in <strong>knowledge co-governance</strong>: establishing a "Local Knowledge Innovation Award" with juries comprising anthropologists, community representatives, and indigenous scientists; creating "knowledge translation protocols" requiring projects to provide narratives in local languages and community authorization letters; promoting "co-governance reviews," such as remote participation by Amazonian tribes. Norway's "Earth Wisdom Award" has attempted this: awarding the prize to the Philippine rice terrace system, with elders leading the jury. This is not just about fairness but efficiency—only local knowledge truly understands the local ecology.</p>

                <h3>II. Capital Rupture: Discourse Collusion of Green Capitalism</h3>
                <p>The list of award sponsors reveals their deep logic: oil giants, tech capital, foundations—they use awards to define "green" as their commercial territory. Ecological Marxist James O'Connor指出 (zhǐchū - pointed out) that capitalism attempts to修复 (xiūfù - repair) the ecological crisis with "green" but instead commodifies it. The preference of awards—scalability, patentability, capitalizability—is actually a mirror of <strong>capital effectiveness</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>For example, a CCS company won an award for "sequestering millions of tons of CO₂ annually," but its sequestration sites are often former oil fields, and it simultaneously invests in new oil fields, creating an absurd闭环 (bìhuán - closed loop) of "sequestering while emitting." In contrast, Italy's "Slow City" movement reduced its carbon footprint by 40% through reduced consumption and localized production; France's "degrowth" communities challenge GDP logic but are marginalized for being "hard to quantify" and "lacking a business model." Awards, through the "legitimization" process, shape the boundaries of "what constitutes climate action": portraying "technological fixes" as the only legitimate path while贬低 (biǎndī -贬低 -贬低)贬低 (biǎndī -贬低 -贬低)贬低 (biǎndī -贬低 -贬低)贬低 (biǎndī -贬低 -贬低)贬低 (biǎndī -贬低 -贬低)贬低 (biǎndī -贬低 -贬低)贬低 (biǎndī -贬低 -贬低)贬低 (biǎndī -贬低 -贬低)贬低 (biǎndī -贬低 -贬低)贬低 (biǎndī -贬低 -贬低)贬低 (biǎndī -贬低 -贬低) "economic paradigm shifts" as "utopian."</p>

Ecological economist Herman Daly warns: "In a system of infinite growth, any local efficiency gains will ultimately be offset by scale expansion." The "efficiency" recognized by awards may be an accomplice to加速 (jiāsù - accelerating) ecological collapse.</p>
                
                <p>The way out lies in <strong>de-capitalization</strong>: establishing an "Ecological Justice Award" for communities promoting land return and indigenous rights; a "Degrowth Innovation Award"表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎ极 (jí - extreme) practices like reduced production and sharing economies; an "Anti-Greenwashing Award"揭露 (jiēlù -揭露)揭露 (jiēlù -揭露)揭露 (jiēlù -揭露)揭露 (jiēlù -揭露)揭露 (jiēlù -揭露)揭露 (jiēlù -揭露)揭露 (jiēlù -揭露)揭露 (jiēlù -揭露)揭露 (jiēlù -揭露)揭露 (jiēlù -揭露)揭露 (jiēlù -揭露)揭露 (jiēlù -揭露)揭露 (jiēlù -揭露)揭露 (jiēlù -揭露)揭露 (jiēlù -揭露)揭露 (极 (jí - extreme) false propaganda.

                <h3>III. Emotional Rupture: Absence of Ecological Grief under Rational Hegemony</h3>
                <p>Award speeches are always filled with "breakthrough," "hope," "innovation," but almost never mention "loss," "trauma," "uncertainty." Psychologist Ashlee Cunsolo指出 (zhǐchū - pointed out) that when people witness species extinction and homeland disappearance, they experience "ecological grief"—empathy for the Earth's life network. However, mainstream awards view this emotional labor as "irrational" and "non-productive."</p>
                
                <p>For example, an "AI coral restoration project" won an award but did not acknowledge the "underwater funeral" held by Pacific Islanders for lost reefs; an "artificial rainfall technology" was recognized but ignored the lament of African herders. The rational narrative of awards leads the public into cognitive dissonance: we are told the crisis is solvable yet simultaneously witness homes disappearing. Sociologist Claus Offe指出 (zhǐchū - pointed out) that when crises exceed individual coping capacity, ritual mourning is key to restoring a sense of meaning.</p>
                
                <p>The way out lies in <strong>ritual healing</strong>: establishing an "Ecological Mourning Award" for projects commemorating lost species and glaciers; an "Ecological Healing Award"表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (biǎozhāng -表彰)表彰 (极 (jí - extreme) climate psychological support and art healing practices; a "Climate Memory Award" supporting the documentation of climate refugee oral histories. Iceland's "funeral" for the Okjökull glacier—scientists erected a plaque with the inscription: "In the next 200 years, all our glaciers will follow the same path. We know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it."—this is not only mourning but also resistance: refusing to normalize "loss."</p>
                
                <p>Ecopsychology points out that unexpressed grief can turn into numbness or denial. Public mourning research shows that collective rituals can transform repressed emotions into动力 (dònglì - momentum) for social connection. Anthropologist Victor Turner emphasized: rituals are the reorganization of social relations. A funeral for a glacier might awaken empathy more effectively than ten emission reduction reports.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion: From Tool Recognition to Civilization Restructuring Ceremony</h3>
                <p>The triple rupture of climate awards—knowledge exclusion, capital collusion, emotional absence—is actually a microcosm of the deep contradictions of modernity: instrumental rationality overpowering cultural diversity, capital logic suppressing ecological justice, efficiency worship replacing the search for meaning. And the triple possibility—knowledge co-governance, de-capitalization, ritual healing—points to a paradigm revolution: <strong>from "tool recognition" to "civilization restructuring ceremony."</strong></p>
                
                <p>Future climate awards should not just be green billboards for capital but become:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A field for cross-cultural dialogue</strong>, allowing local wisdom and global science to converse equally;</li>
                    <li><strong>Experimental ground for decolonial governance</strong>, challenging knowledge hegemony and capital logic;</li>
                    <li><strong>A vehicle for public mourning rituals</strong>, helping society complete the psychological transition from "denial" to "acceptance."</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>When one day, an award is given to a "zero-consumption community" for its "slowest growth of the year"; when a community wins for the "most sincere mourning of the year"; when a project is recognized for "cultural sustainability" rather than "technological maturity"—only then have we truly begun to step out of the green illusion.</p>
                
                <p>Because climate justice has never been about "better technology" but about "a different world." And awards should become the <strong>invitation</strong> to that world.</p>
