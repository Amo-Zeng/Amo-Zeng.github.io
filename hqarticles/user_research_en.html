            <h2>Beyond User Boundaries: Exploring New Frontiers of User Value Through Technology and Strategy Integration</h2>
            <p>In the wave of the digital era, enterprises are facing unprecedented market complexity and diversity of user needs. The traditional "target user" strategy, while providing clear market positioning for businesses in the past, has gradually revealed its limitations, unable to fully meet the expectations of enterprises in innovation and sustainable development goals. Meanwhile, the rapid development of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies, as well as the deeper application of the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) model, have brought unprecedented possibilities for user research and business strategies. This article will delve into how to transcend the traditional thinking of "target users," fully leverage VR/AR technology, and deeply integrate the CLV model to construct a more comprehensive and profound user value system.</p>

            <h3>1. Breaking the Limitations of "Target Users": Uncovering the Potential Value of "Non-Target Users"</h3>
            <p>When defining "target users," enterprises usually base their decisions on demographic characteristics and consumer behavior, dividing users into "core" and "peripheral" groups. However, this classification often overlooks users who seem to be outside the "core" range, and these users may hold significant market potential and innovation opportunities.</p>
            <p>For example, the elderly's demand for smartphone usability has driven the development of features like larger fonts and voice assistants, which not only enhance the experience for elderly users but also bring convenience to younger users. Similarly, the needs of visually impaired users for accessibility technology have promoted advancements in screen readers and voice recognition, making these technologies available to a broader user base.</p>
            <p>The value of "non-target users" lies not only in their potential market size but also in their role in driving enterprise innovation. By deeply understanding these users' needs, enterprises can break the existing product design mindset and create more inclusive and human-centered solutions. Additionally, focusing on "peripheral users" can enhance a company's brand value and social influence, showcasing its commitment to social diversity and inclusivity.</p>

            <h3>2. VR/AR Technology: Reshaping the Depth and Breadth of User Research</h3>
            <p>The advent of VR/AR technology has provided new tools and methods for user research. Traditional user research methods, such as surveys and interviews, often fail to capture users' behavior and psychological reactions in real-world scenarios. VR/AR technology, by creating immersive experiences, allows researchers to observe users' behavior in virtual environments more intuitively, thus gaining more authentic insights.</p>
            <p>For instance, VR technology can simulate driving scenarios, helping automakers understand users' driving experiences under different road conditions. AR fitting mirrors can record users' try-on behaviors, revealing their aesthetic preferences and purchase decision-making processes. Moreover, VR/AR technology can capture users' subconscious reactions, such as eye movement trajectories and micro-expressions, providing deeper behavioral analysis for researchers.</p>
            <p>Although VR/AR technology shows great potential in user research, its application still faces challenges such as high technical costs and complex data analysis. However, as the technology continues to mature and costs gradually decrease, these barriers will be overcome. In the future, VR/AR technology is expected to play a more significant role in cross-regional user research, personalized user insights, and user co-creation platforms.</p>

            <h3>3. CLV Model: Deeply Integrating User Research with Business Strategy</h3>
            <p>The Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) model provides enterprises with a framework for evaluating user value from a long-term perspective. By analyzing users' consumption behavior, social relationships, and interest preferences, enterprises can stratify users and predict their future value. This not only helps identify high-potential users but also provides data support for business strategy formulation.</p>
            <p>For example, an e-commerce platform uses the CLV model to identify high-value and potential high-value users and develops differentiated acquisition, retention, and monetization strategies for different groups. For high-value users, the platform offers exclusive membership services and personalized recommendations; for potential high-value users, it stimulates their consumption desires through personalized content and promotional information. This strategy based on the CLV model not only enhances user satisfaction but also maximizes the enterprise's long-term revenue.</p>
            <p>The application of the CLV model hinges on in-depth user research. Through consumption behavior analysis, social relationship mining, and interest preference research, enterprises can more accurately predict users' future value and provide scientific basis for business decisions. In the future, with the development of big data and artificial intelligence technology, the CLV model will play an increasingly important role in user research and business strategy.</p>

            <h3>4. Integration and Innovation: Building a New Paradigm of User Value</h3>
            <p>Transcending "target users," leveraging VR/AR technology, and applying the CLV model are not isolated; they can integrate to jointly build a new paradigm of user value. For example, enterprises can use VR/AR technology to deeply understand the needs of "non-target users" and incorporate these insights into the CLV model to develop more inclusive and forward-looking business strategies.</p>
            <p>In addition, VR/AR technology can provide richer data sources for the CLV model, such as users' behavior records and subconscious reactions in virtual environments. These data not only enhance the accuracy of the CLV model but also provide enterprises with more comprehensive user insights.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>5. Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In an increasingly competitive market environment, enterprises need to explore user value with a more open and innovative perspective. By transcending the limitations of "target users," reshaping user research with VR/AR technology, and deeply integrating the CLV model, enterprises can build a more comprehensive and profound user value system. This not only helps uncover potential market opportunities but also drives enterprise innovation and achieves sustainable long-term development. In the future, the exploration of user value will no longer be limited to a single dimension but will be opened up through the integration of technology and strategy, ushering in a new chapter.</p>
