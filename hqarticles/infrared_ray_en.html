            <h3>Definition and Characteristics of Infrared</h3>
            <p>Infrared is a range of wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum situated between visible light and microwaves, typically defined as wavelengths longer than 700 nanometers and shorter than 1 millimeter. Although we cannot see infrared directly, it plays various roles in nature. More than 50% of sunlight consists of infrared, which penetrates the atmosphere, passes through glass, and is absorbed by the ground, converting into heat. This characteristic makes infrared an essential medium for sensing the temperature of our surroundings.</p>
            <p>According to the black-body radiation law, the higher the temperature of an object, the shorter the infrared wavelength it emits and the stronger the energy. For instance, the infrared wavelengths emitted by the human body primarily concentrate between 9-10 micrometers, falling within the far-infrared band. This characteristic makes infrared an essential medium for sensing the temperature of our surroundings.</p>

            <h3>Infrared and Human Perception</h3>
            <p>Infrared interacts with human skin, directly affecting our temperature perception and comfort. When infrared irradiates the skin, it is absorbed by the molecules in the skin's surface layer, quickly converting into heat and raising the skin temperature. This temperature change occurs instantaneously, allowing us to directly feel the heat of sunlight without relying on air conduction or convection.</p>
            <p>Moreover, infrared influences the evaporation of sweat to regulate body temperature. As sweat evaporates on the skin surface, it carries away a significant amount of heat, helping the body cool down. However, the presence of infrared disrupts this process. In high-temperature environments, infrared makes the skin and air unusually dry, reducing the efficiency of sweat evaporation and causing a higher perceived temperature. This explains why, even with the same humidity, environments under direct sunlight always feel hotter in the scorching summer.</p>
            <p>The impact of infrared is not limited to external environments. It also indirectly alters our physiological state by regulating our thermoregulatory center. For example, in intensely sunny environments, the body secretes more adrenaline and cortisol to cope with the thermal stress caused by infrared. These physiological changes not only affect our mood but may also have profound impacts on our cognitive abilities and behavior.</p>

            <p>Infrared heating technology is one of the most common applications. For example, using infrared heating panels or infrared bulbs, we can heat food to the desired temperature in seconds without traditional conduction or convection heating. This method is not only highly efficient but also ensures even heat distribution, avoiding common issues of uneven heating. Infrared heaters are also widely used in healthcare to relieve muscle pain and promote blood circulation.</p>
            <p>Infrared photography is another fascinating field. By using specialized infrared lenses, photographers can capture scenes invisible to the naked eye. For instance, infrared photography can penetrate smog, fog, and even plant leaves, revealing details hidden beneath the surface. This technique not only offers new possibilities for artistic creation but also plays a crucial role in scientific research, such as uncovering ancient murals in archaeology or monitoring forest health in ecology.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, infrared communication technology has profoundly changed our daily lives. For example, infrared remote controls emit specific infrared signals to control household appliances like TVs and air conditioners. Infrared sensors are widely used in smartphones, self-driving cars, and other devices to detect object positions, distances, and temperatures. The prevalence of these technologies makes our lives more convenient and our perception of the environment more precise.</p>
