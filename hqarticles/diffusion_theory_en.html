            <h3>Cultural Product Globalization: Diversity and Complexity in Cultural Dissemination</h3>
            <p>In the context of globalization, the diffusion of cultural products has become a complex and diverse process. Cultural products such as movies, music, and literature not only carry cultural information but also influence global cultural exchange and integration through their dissemination mechanisms. The application of diffusion theory in cultural product globalization mainly involves the diffusion pathway of cultural products, cultural adaptation and localization, and the global cultural network.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diffusion Pathway of Cultural Products</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Geographical Factors:</strong> Cultural products often radiate outward from cultural center regions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Economic Factors:</strong> Cultural products from developed countries typically have a higher chance of success in the global market.</li>
                        <li><strong>Political Factors:</strong> Government policies, cultural protectionism, and international relations all influence the diffusion of cultural products.</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Factors:</strong> Social networks and consumer word-of-mouth can significantly accelerate or slow down the spread of cultural products.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Adaptation and Localization</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Language Conversion:</strong> Movies may need dubbing or subtitling when entering different markets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cultural Content Adaptation:</strong> Movie content may also need adjustments to align with local aesthetic standards and cultural values.</li>
                        <li><strong>Repackaging and Promotion Strategies:</strong> Disney's animated movies, when promoted globally, adjust their marketing strategies and market positioning based on different cultural backgrounds and consumer habits.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Global Cultural Network</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cultural Center Cities:</strong> International metropolises like New York, London, and Tokyo are not only the birthplace of cultural products but also the core hubs of their diffusion.</li>
                        <li><strong>International Cultural Institutions and Organizations:</strong> Entities like UNESCO and international film festivals promote global cultural circulation and exchange through cultural activities and projects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Multinational Corporations and Media Groups:</strong> Hollywood's big six movie studios promote films worldwide through their global distribution networks.</li>
