            <h2>At the end of the 19th century, Vienna was witnessing a silent yet profound revolution unfolding.</h2>
            <p>The Vienna Secession, a group of avant-garde artists, revolutionized not only the identity of artists but also explored new paths for cultural fusion and commercial integration through their bold innovative spirit and cross-disciplinary practices. This revolution profoundly transformed the essence of artistic creation and laid the foundation for the development of modern art and the cultural industry, marking a complete transition from tradition to modernity in art.</p>

            <h3>From "Craftsman" to "Cultural Hero": The Modern Reconstruction of the Artist's Identity</h3>
            <p>In medieval Europe, artists were regarded as craftsmen, with their creations confined within utilitarian frameworks. Although the Renaissance elevated the status of artists, they still remained shackled by the identity of craftsmen. It was not until the rise of the Vienna Secession that the artist's identity truly underwent modern reconstruction.</p>
            <p>The artists of the Secession, like Prometheus breaking free from his chains, deconstructed the traditional artistic order with rebellious attitudes. They no longer merely created decorative pieces for patrons but emerged as cultural innovators, using art to express their thoughts and pursuit of modernity. Gustav Klimt's "The Kiss," with its flowing golden patterns, broke the realistic constraints of the academy, serving as a manifesto for artists' rights to self-expression.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Fusion and Identity Crisis: The Multicultural Symphony of the Empire's Twilight</h3>
            <p>Vienna at the end of the 19th century was experiencing an unprecedented cultural upheaval. The once-glorious Austro-Hungarian Empire, amidst a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, and multi-cultural tapestry, was heading towards decline. The artists of the Secession, caught in the fissures of this era, composed a symphonic chapter of cultural crisis and self-redemption through their artistic practices.</p>
            <p>The artists of the Secession faced a fragmented cultural identity. They could neither fully identify with the Empire's German cultural hegemony nor find their place between Jewish and German cultures. Klimt's work "Philosophy" was attacked by the academy as "decadent art," reflecting this deep cultural identity dilemma.</p>

            <h3>Reconstructing the Boundaries of Art and Commerce: Pioneers of Modern Design</h3>
            <p>The artistic creations of the Vienna Secession were imbued with a strong commercial awareness from the outset. They were no longer isolated, haughty artists in ivory towers but modern designers well-versed in market rules. Artists like Klimt and Hoffmann keenly captured the pulse of the times, abandoning blind adherence to traditional artistic forms and instead pursuing a design philosophy that could simultaneously satisfy aesthetic value and practical function.</p>
            <p>This philosophy was perfectly embodied in their posters and exhibition spaces designed for expositions. Klimt's "Beethoven Frieze" poster was not just an artwork but also a design piece capable of generating market demand. Its geometric patterns, bold color contrasts, and symbolic pattern combinations created a design sample that was both visually impactful and capable of quickly conveying information.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Dual Wisdom of Art and Commerce</h3>
            <p>The revolutionary nature of the Vienna Secession was not only reflected in the innovation of artistic forms but also in their deep reconstruction of the relationship between art and commerce. They proved through their actions that true artistic innovation must possess both cultural awareness and market insight. This dual wisdom left an indelible mark in both art and business history.</p>
