            <h2>The Future of Design Exhibition: Deep Insights from Multidimensional Perspectives</h2>
            <p>Design exhibitions, as important platforms for showcasing design achievements, have gradually moved away from traditional static display models in recent years, exploring more diverse and deeper forms of expression. By examining the "Breaking Traditional Narratives: From 'Objects' to 'Relationships'," "Cross-disciplinary Integration: From 'Design' to 'Design+'," and "Reflection and Critique: From 'Praise' to 'Questioning'" perspectives, we can comprehensively assess the current state and future of design exhibitions, guiding the audience to deeper reflections on design.</p>

            <h3>Breaking Traditional Narratives: From "Objects" to "Relationships"</h3>
            <p>Traditional design exhibitions often revolve around the "objects" themselves, emphasizing the aesthetic value, functionality, and innovation of the works. However, this singular narrative approach has gradually revealed its limitations: it focuses excessively on the "objects" themselves while neglecting the complex relationships between design and the broader world. By shifting the focus from "objects" to "relationships," design exhibitions can delve deeper into the profound connections between design works and users, environments, cultures, and even time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interaction and Participation:</strong> More exhibitions are beginning to break away from static display modes, allowing the audience to become part of the design process through interaction and participation.</li>
                <li><strong>Environment and Symbiosis:</strong> Design exhibitions are now focusing on the relationship between works and the natural environment, exploring how design can achieve harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.</li>
                <li><strong>Culture and Heritage:</strong> Exhibitions are increasingly paying attention to the cultural context behind the works, examining their significance in the preservation and development of traditional culture.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cross-disciplinary Integration: From "Design" to "Design+"</h3>
            <p>Design has long transcended the realm of mere "beauty" and "functionality," with deeper cross-disciplinary integrations with various fields. Through the "Design+" perspective, we can explore collaborations between design and technology, society, art, and other domains, showcasing the limitless possibilities of design.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Design+Technology:</strong> The rapid development of technology has brought endless possibilities to design, such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and 3D printing.</li>
                <li><strong>Design+Society:</strong> More designers are directing their attention towards social issues, using design to advocate for vulnerable groups and contribute to social equity.</li>
                <li><strong>Design+Art:</strong> The boundaries between design and art are gradually blurring, with mutual influence and integration enriching design with deeper meaning and emotion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflection and Critique: From "Praise" to "Questioning"</h3>
            <p>Design exhibitions should not merely praise the design works but also guide the audience to reflect on and critique the design itself. By approaching design from a critical mindset, examining its limitations, ethical issues, and societal impact, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the essence of design.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ethical Dilemmas in Design:</strong> Ethical issues that may arise in the pursuit of efficiency and aesthetics in design, such as privacy breaches, cultural erosion, and environmental pollution.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Relations in Design:</strong> How design can be manipulated by power, such as commercial interests and political propaganda, and how design can resist and subvert these power relations.</li>
                <li><strong>Future Directions of Design:</strong> Looking ahead to the future of design, exploring how it will evolve under the influence of new technologies like artificial intelligence and biotechnology, and how the role of humans in design will be redefined.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion: Multidimensional Perspectives on Design Exhibitions</h3>
            <p>Through the "Breaking Traditional Narratives: From 'Objects' to 'Relationships'," "Cross-disciplinary Integration: From 'Design' to 'Design+'," and "Reflection and Critique: From 'Praise' to 'Questioning'" perspectives, we can comprehensively assess the current state and future of design exhibitions. Design exhibitions are no longer merely static displays of "objects" but have become spaces filled with interaction, thought, and reflection.</p>
