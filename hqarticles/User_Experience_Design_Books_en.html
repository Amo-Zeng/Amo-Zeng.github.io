            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the digital age, user experience (UX) design is undergoing a profound transformation. Traditional functional design can no longer meet users' needs for deep engagement and emotional resonance. Emerging technologies such as gamification thinking, multimodal interaction, and affective computing are reshaping the core logic of user experience. This article will start from the "flow" theory, explore how to stimulate user immersion through gamification thinking, create a sensory revolution through multimodal interaction, and use affective computing to add warmth to intelligent experiences, ultimately achieving an upgrade from "passive use" to "active co-creation" in user experience.</p>
