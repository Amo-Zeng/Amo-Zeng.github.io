            <h2>Reshaping the Food Safety Paradigm: From Cognitive Bias to Technical Rights and Ethical Balance</h2>
            <h3>Introduction: The Multidimensional Dilemma of Food Safety</h3>
            <p>In the modern food safety sector, businesses face a complex triangular dilemma: <strong>cognitive bias</strong> leading to irrational consumer behavior, <strong>information asymmetry</strong> triggering trust crises, and the <strong>declining marginal utility of ethical investment</strong>. These three intertwined challenges collectively form the deep-rooted difficulty in food safety governance. Overcoming this dilemma requires not only technological innovation support but also guidance from behavioral science and ethical economics theories to achieve breakthroughs in integrated governance.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Cognitive Bias: The Invisible Driver Distorting Market Rationality</h3>
            <p>Consumers’ “psychological safety compensation effect” often significantly diverges from technological safety standards. Based on behavioral economics theories, consumers’ risk judgments regarding food are influenced by multiple cognitive biases, including the <strong>availability heuristic</strong>, <strong>naturalistic fallacy</strong>, and <strong>affect heuristic</strong>. For example, although science proves some food additives harmless, consumers still tend to pay premiums for “additive-free” labels. This “cognitive tax” directly increases companies’ compliance costs.</p>
            <p>To quantify the impact of such cognitive bias, the <strong>Cognitive Bias Index (CBI)</strong> can be introduced:
                \[
                CBI = \frac{\text{Consumer Perceived Risk} - \text{Actual Risk}}{\text{Incremental Compliance Cost}}
                \]
                For example, in a dairy company, excessive fear of the compliant thickener “carrageenan” forced the company to replace it with starch, increasing production costs by 23%. The CBI reached as high as 23.7. This “cognitive tax” not only crowds out resources that could be used for technological upgrades but also exacerbates irrational competition in the market, forming a vicious cycle.
            </p>

            <h3>Blockchain Technology: Reconstructing Trust and Rights Mechanisms</h3>
            <p>Blockchain technology offers a revolutionary paradigm to solve information asymmetry. Through distributed ledgers and smart contracts, blockchain upgrades the traditional HACCP system's “black box” management into full-chain transparent governance where “data is evidence.” For instance, IBM Food Trust enabled Walmart to reduce mango traceability from 7 days to 2 seconds, and the immutability and real-time nature of data significantly boosted consumer trust.</p>
            <p>The <strong>trust multiplier effect</strong> of blockchain can be quantified by the following model:
                \[
                Overall\ Trustworthiness = (Single\ Node\ Trustworthiness)^n
                \]
                For example, if a batch of beef goes through 20 traceability nodes from farm to retail, with each node having 90% trustworthiness, total trustworthiness can reach 99.99%. Moreover, blockchain’s zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology protects sensitive company data while ensuring compliance verification credibility, further enhancing data security.
            </p>

            <h3>The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility of Ethical Investment</h3>
            <p>Ethical investments by companies in food safety—such as sustainable sourcing and full-chain traceability—initially significantly improve brand image and consumer trust, but their effectiveness doesn’t grow indefinitely. Using nonlinear function modeling, we observe:
                \[
                Consumer\ Surplus = aE^b - cE^d
                \]
                where \(E\) represents ethical investment, and \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(d\) are parameters. When investment exceeds a critical value, the growth of consumer surplus slows or even declines, indicating diminishing marginal utility of ethical investment.
            </p>
            <p>Take Unilever Indonesia’s palm oil traceability project as an example: initially, blockchain technology enhanced supply chain transparency and significantly increased consumer trust. However, as investments continued, consumer perception gradually saturated, and further investments failed to yield proportional performance improvement but increased operational costs. This phenomenon highlights the importance of optimizing ethical investments.</p>

            <h3>Breaking the Dilemma: The Triple Integration of Technology, Behavior, and Ethics</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Technology Track</strong>: Construct a “data-as-evidence” trust mechanism through blockchain technology and big data analytics, enhancing consumer trust via transparent and tamper-proof process certification.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavior Track</strong>: Embed behavioral science into food safety governance, for example, bridging consumers' cognitive gaps through narrative marketing and risk visualization databases.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethics Track</strong>: Dynamically adjust ethical investments and optimize cost functions to maximize efficiency within the diminishing marginal utility threshold.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For example, Alibaba’s “blockchain traceability + emotional storytelling” pork traceability system not only ensures technical data credibility but also enhances consumers’ emotional trust by sharing farmers’ stories, resulting in a 17% increase in willingness to pay.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Multidimensional Reconstruction Toward Real Safety</h3>
            <p>The essence of food safety is “real safety” rather than “perceived safety.” Facing dilemmas of cognitive bias, information asymmetry, and ethical costs, enterprises need to combine technological innovation, behavioral science, and ethical economics to build a multidimensional governance framework. Blockchain’s “trust multiplier,” behavioral science’s “cognitive correction,” and ethical economics’ “dynamic optimization” together point to the future direction of food safety governance—improving consumer trust while achieving efficient resource allocation and sustainable industry development. This is not only a technological revolution but a battle of rationality and trust reconstruction.</p>
            <p>This article provides a thorough analysis of cognitive bias, blockchain technology, and ethical investment and proposes a multidimensional integrated governance path, offering theoretical support and practical guidance for enterprises in the field of food safety.</p>
