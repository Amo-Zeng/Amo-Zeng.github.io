            <h2>Transformation of Urban Sculpture: Integration of Art, Ecology, and Society</h2>
            <p>Urban sculpture, an art form laden with profound cultural and historical significance, is undergoing a profound transformation. They are no longer mere ornaments or cultural symbols of the city, but have become disseminators of social issues and integral parts of the urban ecosystem. With the continuous penetration of digital technology, the forms and functions of urban sculpture are undergoing earth-shaking changes. By integrating with augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and interactive projection technologies, urban sculptures create a multi-dimensional artistic space, greatly enhancing the audience's sense of participation and immersive experience.</p>

            <h3>Integration of Digital Technology and Expansion of Artistic Space</h3>
            <p>The introduction of digital technology has transformed urban sculptures from static decorations into dynamic and adaptive forms of artistic expression. Augmented reality technology brings new dimensions to the sculptures, allowing viewers to see overlaid virtual elements through AR applications. These elements can change appearance according to the season, festival, or specific events, increasing interactivity and freshness of experience. Virtual reality technology provides a completely new way of artistic experience, where viewers can enter a virtual space entirely built by digital technology through VR devices, interact with the sculptures, and deeply understand and feel the charm of sculpture art. Interactive projection technology turns the surface of the sculpture into a giant interactive screen, enabling viewers to interact with the projected content through touch or movement, enhancing the sense of participation and dynamic display of the sculpture.</p>

            <h3>Visualization of Social Issues and Public Participation</h3>
            <p>Urban sculptures are becoming powerful media for conveying and discussing complex social issues. Artists transform abstract social problems into tangible artworks through sculpture creation, such as sculptures constructed from discarded materials, symbolically reflecting environmental and social inequality issues. These sculptures are displayed in the public spaces of the city, stimulating people's thinking and resonance in a visual way. Public participation and interactive device design, such as touch-sensitive screens, AR experiences, or information boards, allow the public to deeply understand the social issues behind the sculptures and participate in related discussions and actions while appreciating them.</p>

            <h3>Ecological Sustainability and Green Art</h3>
            <p>The design philosophy of urban sculptures is gradually shifting from mere aesthetic pursuit to ecological sustainability. Sculptures integrated with plant growth designs and made from recyclable or eco-friendly materials not only beautify the urban environment but also provide habitats and food sources for birds and insects, enhancing urban biodiversity. These works not only improve the quality of life for residents and strengthen the ecological resilience of the city, but also educate the public on the importance of ecological balance and environmental protection through artistic forms, stimulating awareness of ecological conservation.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, the transformation of urban sculptures reflects the deep integration of art, ecology, and society. The combination of digital technology, visualization of social issues and public participation, and ecological sustainability and green art makes urban sculptures dynamic ecological participants, enriching the内涵 of urban culture, promoting ecological balance and sustainable development. With the continuous advancement of technology and the acceleration of urbanization, urban sculptures will continue to play a key role in shaping our urban culture, social dialogue, and ecological health, injecting more artistic vitality and ecological wisdom into urban spaces.</p>
