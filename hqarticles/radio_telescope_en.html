            <h2>From "Sound" to "Vision": How Radio Telescopes Reshape Our Understanding of the Universe</h2>
            <p>In the long history of human exploration of the universe, optical telescopes have always been the protagonist, revealing the appearance of planets, stars, and galaxies. However, the mysteries of the universe are far from just that. When we turn our gaze to the other end of the electromagnetic spectrum—radio waves—a new universe gradually unfolds before us. Radio telescopes, which are the key tools in this revolution in our comprehension of the universe from "sound" to "vision," not only expand our horizons but also help us trace the origins of time and reveal the past and future of the universe by capturing its "sounds."</p>

            <h3>Optical vs. Radio: A Dialogue of Two Universes</h3>
            <p>Optical telescopes capture electromagnetic waves within the visible light range, presenting us with the "appearance" of the universe, such as the forms, colors, and trajectories of planets, stars, and galaxies. However, many important phenomena in the universe are not within the visible light range. For instance, the accretion disks around black holes, the remnants of supernovae, and the magnetic field structures in the interstellar medium all exhibit unique behaviors in the radio wave band.</p>
            <p>Radio telescopes observe radio waves, which are longer in wavelength and lower in frequency. If optical telescopes capture the "image" of the universe, then radio telescopes are listening to the "sounds" of the universe. The regular pulses of pulsars, low-frequency radiation from galactic cores, and magnetic field vibrations in the interstellar medium—these "sounds" are converted into data in the receivers of radio telescopes, which then generate images.</p>

            <h3>From "Sound" to "Vision": The Magic of Radio Telescopes</h3>
            <p>The imaging process of radio telescopes is the transformation of intangible sounds into tangible images. Unlike optical telescopes that directly receive photons, radio telescopes use antenna arrays to capture radio waves and convert their intensity, frequency, and phase information into images through complex signal processing techniques.</p>
            <p>Take the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) technique as an example. Radio telescope arrays synchronize the signals from multiple telescopes to form a virtual giant telescope. This method not only improves resolution but also generates high-precision images, such as the "shadow" of a black hole. In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project successfully captured an image of the black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy, marking a landmark achievement in the transformation from "sound" to "vision" by radio telescopes.</p>

            <h3>Major Discoveries in Radio Astronomy: The Mysteries of the Universe in Sound</h3>
            <p>The advent of radio telescopes has fundamentally changed our understanding of the universe. In 1967, Jocelyn Bell of Cambridge University discovered pulsars, which were later proven to be the rotational signals of neutron stars. The discovery of pulsars not only confirmed the existence of neutron stars but also laid the theoretical groundwork for the detection of gravitational waves.</p>
            <p>Another milestone was the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) in 1965, the "afterglow" of the Big Bang. Observations by radio telescopes confirmed the standard model of cosmology and provided crucial clues for the study of dark matter and dark energy. Additionally, radio telescopes have made breakthroughs in the fields of interstellar medium, galaxy formation and evolution, and high-energy astrophysics. For example, FAST (China's Sky Eye) has achieved significant results in pulsar searches and fast radio burst research, showcasing the immense potential of radio telescopes in exploring unknown cosmic realms.</p>

            <h3>Listening to the Past of the Universe: Radio Telescopes and Time Travel</h3>
            <p>Although the speed of light is the fastest in the natural world, it still appears slow on the vast scale of the universe. When we observe a distant star through an optical telescope, we are actually seeing it as it was millions of years ago. However, optical telescopes can only capture light within the visible spectrum, making them inadequate for deeper cosmic information, especially the early universe.</p>
            <p>Radio telescopes are different; they can receive radio waves from the depths of the universe, often from the earliest cosmic events. Because radio waves have a longer wavelength, they can penetrate dust and gas, reaching Earth with minimal interference. Therefore, radio telescopes can capture older cosmic signals, helping us trace the origins of time.</p>

            <h4>The Discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation</h4>
            <p>The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) is the radiation left over from the Big Bang, filling the entire universe and representing the earliest light. In 1965, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered this faint microwave radiation using radio telescopes, providing crucial evidence for the Big Bang theory. Further radio observations have allowed scientists to study tiny fluctuations in the CMB, revealing the early distribution of matter and the evolution of the universe.</p>

            <h4>Formation of Early Galaxies</h4>
            <p>In the infancy of the universe, the first generation of stars and galaxies had not yet formed, and the universe was filled with ionized hydrogen and cold neutral hydrogen. Radio telescopes can observe the distribution of these early cosmic substances through the 21-centimeter hydrogen line, helping us understand how galaxies condensed from the initial gas clouds. For example, joint observations by the James Webb Space Telescope and radio telescopes have revealed the existence of one of the oldest galaxies, GN-z11, which formed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.</p>

            <h4>Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and the Exploration of Dark Energy</h4>
            <p>Radio telescopes also play a crucial role in the study of dark matter and dark energy. By observing the distribution of galaxies and matter in the universe, radio telescopes can capture signals of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), density fluctuations caused by sound waves in the early universe. Studying BAO allows scientists to infer the rate of cosmic expansion, thereby revealing the properties of dark energy and its impact on the evolution of the universe.</p>
