            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>C. Wright Mills is one of the most influential American sociologists of the 20th century, known for his profound critique of power structures and elite rule. Mills' theories are not only significant in their time but also have high application value in today's digital society, personal growth, and environmental justice movements. This article will explore the application of Mills' sociological theories in contemporary society, focusing on the centralization of power on social media platforms, the impact of information flow on public opinion and social movements, issues of data privacy and surveillance, and the role of sociological imagination in personal growth and self-awareness.</p>

            <h2>1. Centralization of Power on Social Media Platforms</h2>
            <p>In his book "The Power Elite," Mills revealed how political, economic, and military elites in American society form an interconnected power network, collectively controlling the decision-making process of the country. In today's digital society, social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and WeChat have become new centers of power. These platforms not only possess vast amounts of user data but also influence the dissemination of information and user cognition through algorithms and content recommendation mechanisms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Monopoly:</strong> By collecting user data, platforms gain a deep understanding of user behavior and preferences, enabling them to precisely push ads and content to maximize commercial benefits. This data monopoly not only invades user privacy but also exacerbates information asymmetry, placing users in a passive position in terms of information acquisition.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic Control:</strong> The algorithms of platforms determine the content users see, which not only affects user cognition but may also exacerbate social division and polarization. The opacity and bias of algorithms make it difficult for users to understand the criteria for information filtering, thus affecting the diversity and fairness of information.</li>
                <li><strong>Speech Control:</strong> Platforms control and restrict user speech through community rules and content review mechanisms, influencing the scope and direction of public discussions. This speech control not only limits freedom of speech but may also lead to information filtering and distortion, affecting public judgment and decision-making.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. The Impact of Information Flow on Public Opinion and Social Movements</h2>
            <p>Mills emphasized that power elites can influence public opinion and behavior by controlling the flow of information. In the digital society, the flow of information on social media platforms has a profound impact on public opinion and social movements.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information Bubbles:</strong> The algorithms of social media platforms tend to push content similar to users' existing views, leading users to fall into "information bubbles" where they are unlikely to encounter different views and information. This phenomenon not only limits users' perspectives but may also lead to a lack of social consensus.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobilization of Social Movements:</strong> Social media platforms provide new tools for organizing and mobilizing social movements. For example, the Arab Spring in 2011 and the Hong Kong anti-extradition movement in 2019 both made full use of social media platforms for information dissemination and mobilization. However, these platforms are also easily exploited by governments and power elites for information manipulation and suppression. This dual role makes the role of social media in social movements more complex.</li>
                <li><strong>Disinformation and Information Warfare:</strong> Disinformation and information warfare on social media platforms have become important means of influencing public opinion. Power elites can influence public judgment and decision-making by creating and spreading disinformation, thereby controlling public discourse. The widespread dissemination of disinformation not only undermines the credibility of information but may also lead to social chaos and instability.</li>
            </ul>
