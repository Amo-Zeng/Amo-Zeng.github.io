            <h2>Introduction: The Paradigm Revolution in Supramolecular Chemistry</h2>
            <p>Traditional supramolecular chemistry centers on <strong>self-assembly, host-guest recognition, and molecular imprinting</strong> under thermodynamic equilibrium, aiming for predictable structures and deterministic functions. This "<strong>static structure paradigm</strong>" has achieved remarkable success in nanomaterials, drug delivery, and sensor design. However, when confronting the high complexity of living systems—featuring <strong>dynamic evolution, environmental responsiveness, information processing, and adaptive behavior</strong>—this paradigm reveals fundamental limitations: it cannot simulate "living" processes, achieve truly "intelligent" responses, or support "programmable" complex behaviors.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the deep integration of nonequilibrium physics, quantum biology, synthetic biology, and artificial intelligence has triggered a profound <strong>paradigm shift</strong> in supramolecular chemistry: from <strong>static, equilibrium, and passive</strong> to <strong>dynamic, nonequilibrium, and active</strong>; from <strong>materials science</strong> to <strong>intelligent systems science</strong>. This transformation is crystallized in three frontier directions: <strong>kinetic programming via nonequilibrium dissipative assembly</strong>, <strong>regulation of quantum coherence in energy transfer</strong>, and <strong>programming of cellular behavior through molecular ecotopes</strong>. Though operating at different scales (molecular dynamics, quantum excited states, cell-microenvironment interfaces), these directions converge on a core idea: <strong>supramolecular systems should not merely be 'structures', but 'intelligent matter' capable of sensing, decision-making, and execution.</strong></p>
            <p>This article systematically integrates these three innovative paradigms, reveals their underlying logical connections, extracts shared <strong>core design principles</strong>, proposes a unified definition and theoretical framework for "<strong>Supramolecular Intelligent Systems</strong>" (Supramolecular Intelligent Systems, SuIS), and envisions their disruptive potential in future technologies.</p>

            <h2>Three Innovative Paradigms: The Shift from Static to Dynamic</h2>

            <h3>1. Dissipative Assembly: Building Evolvable, Life-Like Molecular Systems</h3>
            <p>Traditional self-assembly relies on thermodynamic minimization, resulting in "frozen" structures once formed. In contrast, <strong>dissipative self-assembly</strong> actively introduces <strong>external energy flows</strong> (e.g., ATP, light, chemical fuels) to maintain the system in a nonequilibrium state, enabling dynamic cycles of assembly and disassembly. Its essence is a "<strong>work-degradation</strong>" mechanism: structures form under energy input and spontaneously disassemble when energy is depleted, creating time-dependent evolutionary pathways.</p>
            <p>For example, in an <strong>ATP-driven dynamic DNA-peptide co-assembly system</strong>, pulsed fuel input can encode multi-level structural evolution: the first pulse forms linear fibrils, the second induces cross-linking, achieving "memory-reconstruction" behavior that mimics short-term synaptic plasticity in neurons. Crucially, in <strong>light-controlled microcompartment populations</strong>, periodic optical stimulation selects for subpopulations exhibiting "pulse-synchronized" behavior, demonstrating <strong>molecular Darwinism</strong>—where supramolecular structures evolve via natural selection to enhance dynamic adaptability.</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence plays a pivotal role here: <strong>reinforcement learning optimizes fuel pulse sequences</strong> for "on-demand evolution"; <strong>graph neural networks analyze intermediate-state stability</strong> to reveal "dynamic path selection" mechanisms, shifting design from empirical trial-and-error to <strong>mechanism-driven engineering</strong>.</p>
            <p>The fundamental breakthrough of this paradigm is: <strong>treating 'lifespan', 'evolutionary path', and 'responsiveness' as design parameters, rather than prioritizing structural stability</strong>. Supramolecular systems thus gain life-like behaviors such as "memory", "learning", and "decision-making", advancing toward <strong>evolvable molecular systems</strong>.</p>

            <h3>2. Quantum Coherence Control: From Classical Resonance to Quantum Walks</h3>
            <p>Classical energy transfer theories (e.g., Förster resonance energy transfer, Dexter electron transfer) rely on localized, incoherent, thermally activated mechanisms, limited by dipole coupling strength and spectral overlap. However, in the LH2 complex of photosynthesis, <strong>quantum coherence oscillations lasting over 100 femtoseconds at room temperature</strong> suggest that energy transfer may not be "hopping", but rather a <strong>quantum walk</strong>—where excitons explore multiple pathways simultaneously in a quantum superposition, enabling highly efficient and directional transmission.</p>
            <p>In artificial systems, <strong>trefoil-knot conjugated oligomers</strong> induce phase-locked excitonic coupling via topological constraints, forming <strong>quantum interference patterns</strong>, with energy traversing all chromophores in just 1.2 ps at 92% efficiency. In <strong>quantum dot-porphyrin arrays</strong>, deuterated solvent cages suppress high-frequency phonon scattering, while the porphyrin ring's <strong>in-plane breathing mode</strong> resonates with exciton transitions, creating a "vibration-assisted coherence" channel that extends coherence time to 300 fs.</p>
            <p>These findings show that <strong>topological engineering</strong> (e.g., Möbius strips, topological insulators), <strong>vibrational coupling design</strong>, and <strong>supramolecular shielding strategies</strong> (rigid scaffolds + dynamic solvent cages) can sustain quantum coherence at room temperature. More importantly, supramolecular networks are emerging as <strong>room-temperature quantum simulation platforms</strong>: using DNA origami to build programmable excitonic arrays for studying decoherence dynamics, offering new insights into noise suppression in quantum computing.</p>
            <p>Quantum coherence control not only enhances energy transfer efficiency but also endows supramolecular systems with <strong>parallel information processing</strong> and <strong>path optimization</strong> capabilities, endowing them with the embryonic form of "<strong>quantum intelligence</strong>".</p>

            <h3>3. Molecular Ecotope: A "Molecular Operating System" for Programming Cell Behavior</h3>
            <p>Traditional supramolecular materials act as "static scaffolds", providing only mechanical support and passive signaling. In contrast, the <strong>molecular ecotope</strong> elevates them into an <strong>active "molecular operating system" that programs cellular behavior</strong>, featuring dynamic responsiveness, spatial encoding, and information storage.</p>
            <p>In <strong>light-responsive supramolecular hydrogels</strong>, blue light triggers azobenzene isomerization, releasing Netrin-1 and BDNF, while liquid-liquid phase separation reorients nanofibers to guide neuronal axon "on-demand wiring". In <strong>MMP-responsive DNA-protein networks</strong>, enzymes secreted by cells trigger localized disassembly, releasing specific miRNAs to achieve "cell-state-dependent differentiation programming"—inducing M2 macrophages in inflammatory microenvironments and neuron-like cells in neural injury zones.</p>
            <p>Its technical core lies in <strong>multimodal synergy</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supramolecular phase separation</strong> forms dynamic signal-rich microdomains;</li>
                <li><strong>DNA-protein logic gates</strong> enable modular programming of "molecular instructions";</li>
                <li><strong>AI image analysis</strong> builds "ecotope-cell response" mapping databases, enabling reverse-engineering design.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Molecular ecotopes are no longer mere "containers", but <strong>intelligent environments that communicate with cells</strong>, driving a paradigm shift from "cell therapy" to "<strong>environment-programmed therapy</strong>".</p>

            <h2>Cross-Fusion: Shared Paradigms and Core Design Principles of the Three Directions</h2>
            <p>Though focused on different scales, these three directions share a <strong>unified design philosophy</strong>: <strong>the fundamental transformation of supramolecular systems from passive structures to active intelligence</strong>. Underlying this shift are three <strong>core design principles</strong> that manifest across all paradigms:</p>

                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>

                        <td><strong>System states evolve continuously over time and environment</strong></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Programmability</strong></td>
                        <td>Optimization of fuel pulse sequences</td>

                    </tr>

                        <td><strong>Environmental Responsiveness</strong></td>
                        <td>Adaptive structural evolution</td>
                        <td>Solvent/phonon environment regulation</td>
                        <td>Cellular behavior feedback modulation</td>
                        <td><strong>Bidirectional interaction with the external world, enabling closed-loop control</strong></td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>These principles collectively define "<strong>Supramolecular Intelligent Systems</strong>" (SuIS):</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>SuIS are supramolecular systems designed to exhibit dynamism, programmability, and environmental responsiveness. They can sense internal or external signals, process them via nonequilibrium processes or quantum effects, and execute predefined functions, evolving complex behaviors over time. Possessing closed-loop "sensing-decision-execution" capabilities, they represent intelligent entities at the molecular scale.</strong>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The <strong>theoretical framework</strong> of SuIS comprises four hierarchical levels:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Molecular Level</strong>: Design responsive building blocks (e.g., photoactive groups, enzyme-cleavage sites, quantum-coherent chromophores);</li>
                <li><strong>Network Level</strong>: Construct topologically ordered supramolecular arrays (e.g., DNA origami, phase-separated droplets, excitonic networks);</li>
                <li><strong>Functional Level</strong>: Program dynamic behaviors (e.g., dissipative cycles, quantum walks, cell signaling release);</li>
                <li><strong>System Level</strong>: Integrate AI, microfluidics, and bio-interfaces to achieve "sensing-feedback-learning" closed loops.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This framework breaks the traditional linear "structure-function" relationship, introducing a <strong>three-dimensional design space of "dynamics-intelligence-interaction"</strong>, marking the entry of supramolecular chemistry into the <strong>era of systems science</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Challenges and Future Outlook: Toward the "Molecular Intelligence Era"</h2>
            <p>Despite its promise, SuIS faces multiple challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thermodynamic Efficiency Bottleneck</strong>: Energy conversion in dissipative systems is typically below 30%. High-quantum-yield fuels (e.g., photoactive ATP analogs) and low-energy assembly pathways must be developed;</li>
                <li><strong>Decoherence Control</strong>: Coherence times at room temperature remain short (&lt;500 fs). Multi-scale shielding strategies (e.g., covalent-supramolecular dual networks, topological protected states) are needed;</li>
                <li><strong>Biocompatibility</strong>: Long-term toxicity and immunogenicity of monomers (e.g., DNA, cyclodextrins, photosensitizers) require systematic evaluation;</li>
                <li><strong>Programmability Limitations</strong>: Current systems rely on pre-defined logic, lacking "learning" and "evolution" capabilities. Integration of <strong>molecular neural networks</strong> or <strong>genetic algorithm optimization</strong> is essential;</li>
                <li><strong>Scale-Up and Integration</strong>: Laboratory systems are limited to micron scales, hindering multi-module coordination, in vivo stability, and clinical translation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Future directions center on three domains:</h3>

            <h4>1. Synthetic Life and Molecular Robotics</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Construct <strong>protocell-like systems</strong> with "metabolism-replication-selection" tripartite functions, exploring the chemical origins of life;</li>
                <li>Develop <strong>dissipative molecular machines</strong> capable of autonomous navigation, task execution, and self-repair, for targeted drug delivery or microenvironment repair.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Quantum-Enhanced Materials and Devices</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Leverage coherent energy focusing to develop <strong>quantum-enhanced photocatalysts</strong> for efficient CO₂ reduction and nitrogen fixation;</li>
                <li>Build "quantum walk light-harvesting antennas" to advance <strong>artificial chloroplasts</strong>;</li>
                <li>Integrate supramolecular excitonic networks into microfluidic chips for <strong>multiparameter quantum-coherent sensing</strong> (e.g., pH, temperature, molecular concentration).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Smart Tissue Engineering and Precision Medicine</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Design "smart bone/nerve/cardiac patches" for dynamic remodeling of injury microenvironments and tissue regeneration;</li>
                <li>Develop "tumor ecotope reprogramming systems" that inhibit EMT pathways and migration to "domesticate" cancer cell behavior;</li>
                <li>Build "self-sensing, self-healing" organ-on-a-chip platforms for drug screening, disease modeling, and personalized therapy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion: Redefining the Boundaries of Supramolecular Chemistry</h2>
            <p>Supramolecular chemistry is evolving from "<strong>molecular architecture</strong>" to "<strong>molecular intelligence</strong>". The three paradigms—dissipative assembly, quantum coherence control, and molecular ecotope—collectively reveal the potential of supramolecular systems as <strong>dynamic intelligent matter</strong>: not only forming structures, but also evolving, learning, deciding, and interacting deeply with biological or quantum worlds.</p>
            <p>In the future, SuIS will become the <strong>convergence point of synthetic biology, quantum science, artificial intelligence, and materials engineering</strong>. We are no longer merely "designing molecules", but "<strong>writing source code for molecular behavior</strong>". Under this new paradigm, the boundaries of supramolecular chemistry will be radically expanded—from laboratory beakers to intracellular ecotopes, to quantum pathways in photocatalytic reactors, to every corner of future intelligent materials.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>At the molecular scale, we are creating a programmable, dynamic, and intelligent world.</strong>
