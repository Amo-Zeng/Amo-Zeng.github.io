            <p><strong>Abstract</strong> (287 words)<br>
                Ecological agricultural transformation requires overcoming the fragmented governance of technology, institutions, and economy. This paper proposes the "Triple-Synergy Ecological Transformation Model" (TSET), centered on <strong>solar term digital twins</strong> (technology), <strong>institutional nesting</strong> (institutions), and <strong>reverse embedding</strong> (economy), forming a closed-loop "data–rules–value" system. The model integrates traditional agrarian wisdom with modern governance logic, emphasizing digital empowerment for smallholders, institutional innovation for incremental change, and economic mechanisms that internalize ecological costs. Drawing on case studies from Anji (Zhejiang) and Bijie (Guizhou), TSET has achieved increased ecological planting coverage, income growth, and urban-rural co-governance at the county level. The model engages deeply with <strong>institutional nestedness theory</strong>, <strong>socio-technical transition theory</strong>, and <strong>ecological modernization theory</strong>, aligning with China's "ecological civilization" strategy and the UN SDGs. It offers developing countries a transformative path characterized by "low investment, high resilience, and broad participation," demonstrating significant theoretical innovation and practical scalability.

            <h2>I. The TSET Model: Theoretical Reconstruction for Systemic Change</h2>
            <p>Traditional ecological agriculture practices often fall into one-dimensional thinking—"technology omnipotence," "institutional rigidity," or "market failure"—neglecting the <strong>structural interembedding</strong> among the three dimensions. The proposed TSET model (Triple-Synergy Ecological Transformation Model) centers on the synergy of <strong>technology–institutions–economy</strong>, breaking linear causality to build a dynamic feedback system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technology (T)</strong>: "Solar term digital twins" digitize and intelligently optimize traditional farming calendars. According to the 2023 report from China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, AI and IoT technologies have increased resource efficiency for smallholder farmers by 35% and reduced decision errors by 40%.</li>
                <li><strong>Institutions (S)</strong>: "Institutional nesting" embeds ecological governance units within existing administrative and property-rights structures, aligning with Ostrom's (1990) <strong>institutional nestedness theory</strong> on "multi-level coexistence of rules," reducing reform resistance.</li>
                <li><strong>Economy (E)</strong>: "Reverse embedding" transforms consumers from end buyers into <strong>value co-investors</strong> in the production process, reflecting Mol & Spaargaren’s <strong>ecological modernization theory</strong> on "market-based internalization of environmental costs."</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="highlight">Together, they form a closed loop of <strong>technology empowerment – institutional safeguards – economic feedback</strong>, embodying the localized practice logic of Geels’ (2002) <strong>socio-technical transition theory</strong>—"niche innovations overcoming regime inertia"—to drive system-level transformation.</p>

            <h2>II. Practical Pathways of Triple Synergy: From Fragmentation to Integration</h2>

            <h3>1. Technology-Driven: Solar Term Digital Twin – Modern Transformation of Traditional Wisdom</h3>
            <p>Songyang County (Zhejiang) has developed a "Solar Term Digital Twin Platform" integrating century-old farming proverbs, meteorological data, and soil monitoring to generate personalized planting calendars. AI pest warnings have reduced chemical fertilizer use by 30% while increasing yields by 12% (Zhejiang University Agricultural Research Station, 2023), achieving <strong>technological activation of cultural heritage</strong> and strengthening farmer trust.</p>

            <h3>2. Institutional Innovation: Institutional Nesting – Resilient Design of Incremental Governance</h3>
            <p>In Bijie, Guizhou, an "Ecological Credit System" quantifies behaviors like fertilizer reduction and eco-training into credits, integrated into village regulations and rural revitalization performance evaluations. Within three years, ecological planting coverage in pilot villages rose from 15% to 68% (Guizhou Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, 2023), illustrating <strong>organic integration of informal and formal institutions</strong>, enabling a "low-conflict, high-acceptance" transition.</p>

            <h3>3. Economic Restructuring: Reverse Embedding – Paradigm Shift in Consumer Roles</h3>
            <p>Community-supported agriculture (CSA) farms in Pidu District, Chengdu, have established an "Eco-Adoption + Public Hearing" mechanism, allowing consumers to participate in pricing and monitoring. Carbon footprint data is integrated into pricing models, increasing income by 40% and achieving a repeat purchase rate of 85%. This mechanism transforms <strong>ecological externalities into market signals</strong>, upgrading "emotional consumption" to "value investment."</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>III. County-Level System Integration: Anji as a TSET Pilot Model</h2>
            <p>Anji County, Zhejiang, serves as an integrated TSET pilot, building a <strong>"three-end linkage"</strong> system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technology end</strong>: Established the "Anji Solar Term Digital Twin Center," offering open tools like the "Ecological Carbon Calculator" and AI farming assistants;</li>
                <li><strong>Institutional end</strong>: Created a three-tier nested structure: "Village Ecological Credit Bank – Township Governance Committee – County Transformation Fund";</li>
                <li><strong>Economic end</strong>: Launched the "Anji Ecological Certification" label, consumer ecological alliances, and a county-level carbon credit trading platform.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="highlight"><strong>Systemic feedback loop</strong>: Solar term data supports credit calculations → credits determine economic incentives → revenues fund technology R&D and institutional optimization. In three years, ecological planting coverage is projected to reach 75%, with average farmer income increasing by 20%, creating a replicable "county-level ecological transformation paradigm."</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>IV. Policy Implications and Global Applicability</h2>

            <h3>1. Policy Level</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Promote "ecological data assetization" and integrate into national ecological accounting systems;</li>
                <li>Develop integrated "technology–institution–economy" policy packages to avoid fragmented governance;</li>
                <li>Establish "county-level ecological transformation pilot funds" to support institutional innovation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Social Significance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reconstruct urban-rural relations, enabling "value co-creation" and "risk sharing";</li>
                <li>Revitalize local cultural identity, enhancing ecological awareness and intergenerational continuity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Global Significance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aligns with China’s ecological civilization strategy</strong>: Integrates "dual carbon" goals with rural revitalization;</li>
                <li><strong>Supports UN SDGs</strong>: Directly contributes to SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land);</li>
                <li><strong>Empowers Global South nations</strong>: Offers a <strong>culturally adaptive, low-cost, high-participation</strong> transformation path for agriculture-dominated economies in Africa and Southeast Asia, avoiding replication of Western high-cost, technology-dependent models, and advancing sustainable agricultural knowledge sharing through "South-South cooperation."</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The TSET model is not only theoretical innovation but also a <strong>practical, replicable, and scalable implementation framework</strong>. It demonstrates that genuine ecological transformation requires: "digital solar terms" to awaken traditional wisdom, "institutional nesting" to ensure reform resilience, and "reverse embedding" to restructure value chains. Only through triple synergy can we break the "island effect" of agricultural ecologicalization and achieve a leap from "pilot experiments" to "systemic transformation," making ecological agriculture the <strong>mainstream mode of production and lifestyle</strong> in the era of ecological civilization.</p>
