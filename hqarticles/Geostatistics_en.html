            <h2>Comprehensive Applications of Geostatistics in Global Challenges: Climate Change, Public Health, and Socioeconomic Inequality</h2>
            <p>In the context of globalization and climate change, geostatistics, as a discipline combining spatial statistics with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), has become a crucial tool for addressing multiple global challenges. This article aims to delve deeply into the comprehensive applications of geostatistics in climate change prediction, public health control strategies, and socioeconomic inequality analysis, demonstrating its broad value and profound significance in interdisciplinary research.</p>

            <h3>Core Concepts and Methods of Geostatistics</h3>
            <p>Geostatistics, through spatial data analysis and model construction, can accurately predict and analyze geographically distributed data. Its core methods include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spatial Interpolation Techniques</strong>: Such as Kriging, which uses data from known points to predict values at unknown points.</li>
                <li><strong>Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)</strong>: Performs regression analysis considering the spatial location of data.</li>
                <li><strong>Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis</strong>: Identifies correlations within spatial data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These methods are particularly effective when dealing with complex climate, health, and socioeconomic data, helping to reveal patterns in spatial distribution, predict future trends, and provide scientific basis for policy formulation.</p>
