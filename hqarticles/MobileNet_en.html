            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, the demand for deploying artificial intelligence (AI) on resource-constrained devices is growing. How to achieve efficient AI inference under limited computational resources, storage, and energy consumption has become a challenge shared by both academia and industry. MobileNet, as a lightweight neural network architecture, is gradually becoming a core technology in the field of edge computing due to its excellent computational efficiency and flexibility. At the same time, the rise of model compression techniques and self-supervised learning provides an even broader application scenario for MobileNet. This article will delve into the integration of MobileNet in edge computing, model compression, and self-supervised learning, analyze its advantages and challenges in various fields, and look forward to its future potential.</p>

            <h2>Core Advantages of MobileNet: The Revolution of Depthwise Separable Convolution</h2>
            <p>The core innovation of MobileNet lies in its use of <strong>depthwise separable convolution</strong>, which decomposes the traditional convolution operation into depthwise convolution and pointwise convolution. By this decomposition, MobileNet significantly reduces computational complexity and the number of parameters, enabling it to run efficiently on resource-constrained edge devices.</p>
            <h3>Depthwise Convolution and Pointwise Convolution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Depthwise Convolution</strong>: Performs convolution operations independently on each input channel, reducing the number of convolution kernels and greatly decreasing computational load.</li>
                <li><strong>Pointwise Convolution</strong>: Uses 1x1 convolution kernels to linearly combine the output of depthwise convolution, generating the final output feature map and further reducing computational complexity.</li>
            </ul>
