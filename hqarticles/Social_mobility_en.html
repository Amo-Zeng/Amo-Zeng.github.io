        <section>
            <h2>Introduction: Systemic Reconfiguration of Social Mobility through Digital Technologies</h2>
            <p>In classical sociological thought, social mobility is understood as the process by which individuals achieve upward movement across social strata through institutionalized pathways such as education, occupation, and wealth. Talcott Parsons emphasized "achievement" as the core mechanism of modern mobility, while Pierre Bourdieu revealed how cultural capital reproduces inequality through symbolic "distinction" [1]. James Coleman highlighted the role of social capital—such as family networks and community ties—in intergenerational transmission [2]. However, in today’s world where digital technologies permeate everyday life, these theoretical frameworks face fundamental challenges: <strong>When social mobility is no longer determined solely by degrees, job titles, or income, but increasingly by an individual’s "visibility" in digital spaces, family technological dispositions, and skill accumulation on platforms, the very mechanisms of mobility are undergoing systemic reconfiguration</strong>.</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a <strong>"triple reconfiguration"</strong> analytical framework, identifying three emerging mechanisms of social mobility in the digital age:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Symbolic Recognition Mechanism</strong>: From Bourdieu’s "cultural capital" to "visibility capital" (visibility capital)—the capacity of individuals to be "seen" through content production, algorithmic exposure, and network embeddedness in platform economies, becoming a new form of capital influencing employment, credit, and social opportunities;</li>
                <li><strong>Intergenerational Psychological Structure</strong>: From Coleman’s "social capital" to "techno-generational trauma" (techno-generational trauma)—the anxiety and helplessness of individuals raised in the pre-digital era, transmitted through family systems to younger generations, resulting in an "intergenerational erosion of mobility capacity";</li>
                <li><strong>Control over Labor Process</strong>: From Harry Braverman’s "deskilling" to the "mobility illusion" (mobility illusion)—platforms use algorithmic scheduling and real-time feedback to create the illusion of individual agency, while in reality, they lock workers into a "deskilling trap" through task fragmentation and skill standardization.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These three mechanisms do not operate in isolation but are <strong>interwoven, mutually reinforcing</strong> forces shaping digital-era mobility inequality: visibility capital affects intergenerational resource distribution (e.g., rural youth lacking digital literacy struggle to accumulate visibility capital); techno-generational trauma undermines skill development (e.g., children of middle-class families with tech-illiterate parents miss AI education opportunities); and the deskilling trap limits access to visibility capital (e.g., food delivery riders unable to transition into platform operations due to skill obsolescence), forming a <strong>closed loop of digital mobility</strong>. This paper aims to uncover the structural mechanisms of this loop, challenge the myth of "digital equality," and shift social mobility research from "resource distribution" to deeper dimensions of <strong>cognitive structures, emotional transmission, and technological governance</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Part I: Symbolic Reconfiguration — From Cultural Capital to Visibility Capital</h2>
            <h3>1.1 The Three Dimensions of Visibility Capital</h3>
            <p>Bourdieu’s theory of "cultural capital" shows how cultural resources—such as artistic appreciation and refined language—are transmitted across generations through family and education, functioning as invisible tools of social distinction [1]. In the digital age, this capital undergoes a <strong>symbolic transformation</strong>: the importance of traditional objectified capital (e.g., degrees) declines, while <strong>digital symbolic capital</strong> (e.g., 1 million followers on Douyin, viral notes on Xiaohongshu) becomes the new "passport" to opportunity.</p>
            <p>This paper introduces the concept of <strong>visibility capital</strong>, referring to the "capacity to be seen" that individuals gain through three key abilities in digital spaces:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Content Production Capacity</strong>: Includes video editing, writing, graphic design, etc. According to the <em>2023 China Digital Labor Research Report</em> [3], urban youth significantly outperform rural users in content creation skills, with participation rates of 68% versus 29%;</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic Affinity</strong>: Platform algorithms determine visibility through "recommendation mechanisms." Data from Douyin shows that the top 1% of creators receive over 70% of recommendation traffic, creating a "Matthew effect" of cumulative advantage [4];</li>
                <li><strong>Social Network Embeddedness</strong>: Strong ties (e.g., interactions with KOLs) provide trust and endorsement; weak ties (e.g., followers) enable commercial monetization. Middle-class individuals are more adept at building "professional weak ties" on platforms like LinkedIn, while working-class users rely on "emotional fans," whose monetization paths are less stable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Visibility capital not only determines traffic allocation but also directly connects to three real-world domains: <strong>education, credit, and employment</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Education</strong>: Universities now accept "digital portfolios" in admissions, e.g., Tsinghua’s "Strong Foundation Program" includes Bilibili science videos as evaluation materials;</li>
                <li><strong>Credit</strong>: Sesame Credit incorporates "social activity" and "content authenticity" into credit scoring, affecting loan limits and housing eligibility;</li>
                <li><strong>Employment</strong>: Job platforms treat "social media influence" as a resume booster. For example, a leading internet company’s operations role requires "an account with 100,000+ followers."</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.2 The Dialectic of Algorithmic vs. Social Recognition</h3>
            <p>Erving Goffman’s theory of "impression management" faces structural challenges in the platform era. His "front stage/back stage" dichotomy dissolves in an environment of "perpetual online presence"—users perform not only for human audiences but are also "watched" by algorithms. More critically, <strong>algorithms have become new agents of recognition</strong>.</p>
            <p>Applying Axel Honneth’s theory of recognition [5], social dignity requires three dimensions: "love, rights, and solidarity." Yet, "being seen by algorithms" only partially fulfills this: it enables "solidarity" (fan recognition) and "rights" (commercial deals), but lacks "love" (emotional depth) and "dignity" (value affirmation). Even more dangerously, algorithmic recognition is <strong>revocable</strong>—once content violates rules or loses popularity, users can instantly shift from "influencer" to "invisible." For example, a Douyin creator lost 60% of followers after a single video was restricted, terminating all brand partnerships.</p>
            <h3>1.3 Digital Cultural Re-Distinction</h3>
            <p>Visibility capital does not eliminate cultural distinction; instead, it generates <strong>digital cultural re-distinction</strong>. Rural youth, even when entering platforms, are often labeled "rustic" or "low-quality," struggling to overcome algorithmic bias. Urban youth, by contrast, leverage symbols like "aesthetic refinement" and "knowledge monetization" to build "digital cultural capital," further consolidating class advantages.</p>
            <p><strong>Case</strong>: Douyin user "Zhang Tongxue" achieved symbolic upward mobility, but most rural creators remain marginalized due to content styles deemed "insufficiently urban." Algorithms favor "urban aesthetics" and "refinement," pushing "rural narratives" to the periphery. Bourdieu’s logic of "distinction" persists in digital spaces—now more subtly: <strong>not rejection, but "selective visibility"</strong>.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Part II: Intergenerational Reconfiguration — From Cultural Reproduction to Techno-Generational Trauma</h2>
            <p>When "AI portfolios" and "metaverse internships" become new gateways to education, technology is no longer just a tool—it has become a <strong>new form of cultural capital</strong>. Yet, technological change amplifies intergenerational mobility disparities through family systems, producing "<strong>techno-generational trauma</strong>"—the anxiety and helplessness of those raised in the pre-digital era (50–70s generation), transmitted to younger generations, leading to an "intergenerational erosion of mobility capacity."</p>
            <h3>2.1 Transmission Pathways of Techno-Generational Trauma</h3>
            <p>Eric Hoffer’s theory of the "broken generation" is recontextualized in the digital age: the 50–70s generation faces challenges in career transitions, educational support, and access to digital resources, forming <strong>technological trauma</strong>. This trauma is transmitted through three pathways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emotional Transmission</strong>: Parents’ tech anxiety (e.g., "AI will replace humans") leads to rejection or over-intervention in children’s tech learning. A survey shows 42% of middle-aged and elderly parents consider "AI learning too dangerous," discouraging their children [6];</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Transmission</strong>: Significant disparities in family digital devices, internet access, and tech investment. Urban middle-class families spend an average of ¥12,000 annually on tech education, compared to under ¥2,000 in rural families [6];</li>
                <li><strong>Educational Transmission</strong>: Parents’ lack of awareness about "AI portfolios" and "coding competitions" prevents them from guiding children into critical competitions. A survey at a key high school found 83% of tech-specialty students come from "dual-income tech families" [7].</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.2 Formation Mechanisms of Techno-Habitus</h3>
            <p>Bourdieu’s theory of "habitus" suggests that individual behavior is shaped by "structuring structures" internalized in body and mind [1]. In digital contexts, <strong>techno-habitus</strong> refers to cognitive patterns and behavioral tendencies formed through long-term technology use. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Digital natives rely on "keyword + algorithmic recommendations" for information, while pre-digital generations prefer "directory indexing + authoritative sources";</li>
                <li>The former favors "trial-and-error + online help" for problem-solving, the latter "systematic learning + expert guidance."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The family is the primary site of techno-habitus formation. Parents’ tech experience, frequency of use, and attitudes directly shape children’s technological cognition. <strong>The difference in "techno-habitus" is, in essence, an intergenerational rupture in cultural capital in the digital age</strong>.</p>
            <h3>2.3 Advantages of Digital-Native Families</h3>
            <p>"Digital-native families"—those with parents in tech roles like programmers or data analysts—endow their children with significant "habitus advantages" in tech cognition, learning strategies, and resource access. For example, second-generation Chinese Americans in Silicon Valley are 3.5 times more likely to work in AI and algorithm roles than children of non-tech immigrant families [8]. This advantage represents <strong>the technological reproduction of family cultural capital</strong>: parents convert their professional experience, values, and networks into their children’s "techno-habitus."</p>
            <p><strong>Case</strong>: Rural left-behind children, with parents working away from home, lack digital devices and remote guidance, facing "technological isolation" during the "online learning era." Their learning participation is 41% lower than urban students [9]. Their families lack not only devices but also "tech companionship"—parents unable to guide children in using online learning platforms, deepening the "digital intergenerational gap."</p>

            <h2>Part III: Labor Reconfiguration — From Deskilling to the Mobility Illusion</h2>
            <p>Platform economies are portrayed as liberating forces freeing workers from traditional employment, yet beneath the surface of "flexible work" and "gig freedom" lies <strong>structural deskilling</strong> and <strong>narrowed pathways for upward mobility</strong>. This paper introduces the concepts of "<strong>mobility illusion</strong>" and "<strong>skill sinking</strong>" to reveal the paradox of "high mobility, low development" in platform labor.</p>
            <h3>3.1 The Production Mechanism of the Mobility Illusion</h3>
            <p>Platforms create an illusion of "individual control" through algorithmic scheduling, real-time feedback, and rating systems. For example, Meituan’s delivery app displays "estimated earnings" and "rating impact," giving riders the feeling they can "choose" whether to accept orders. Yet, this "choice" is strictly constrained: the system prioritizes high-paying orders for high-rated riders, marginalizing low-rated ones.</p>
            <p>This process exemplifies <strong>digital Taylorism</strong>: labor is broken into quantifiable, standardized modules (accept order, pick up, deliver), and workers are reduced to "execution terminals" [10]. Michael Burawoy shows how this "manufacturing consent" mechanism leads workers to voluntarily accept high-intensity, low-skill arrangements under the illusion of autonomy [11].</p>
            <h3>3.2 The Deep Logic of Skill Sinking</h3>
            <p>To maintain high ratings and order volume, workers focus exclusively on "platform skills" (rapid response, emotional management, avoiding negative reviews), <strong>severing connection with transferable skills</strong> (project management, data analysis, brand strategy). Meituan’s <em>2023 Rider Career Development Report</em> shows only 12% of riders believe they have skills for career transitions [12].</p>
            <p>Worse, platforms <strong>monopolize skill definition</strong> through ratings—high rating = high skill, excluding external certification. Skills accumulated on platforms cannot be monetized in external labor markets, creating "skill sinking." For example, Fiverr designers, trapped in "low-price bidding" and "template-based design," become "design laborers," with their "Photoshop skills" unrecognized by traditional design firms.</p>
            <h3>3.3 The Duality of Platform Labor</h3>
            <p>Platform labor exhibits a stark duality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Mobility</strong>: Flexible time, geographic dispersion, order autonomy;</li>
                <li><strong>Low Development</strong>: Skill stagnation, lack of professional identity, long-term mobility capacity erosion.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Case</strong>: Ride-hailing drivers, pressured to maintain ratings, accept unreasonable demands, losing bargaining power; delivery riders, trapped in the "grab-order-deliver" loop, cannot access skill training, forming "labor lock-in."</p>

            <h2>Part IV: Critical Synthesis and Policy Pathways</h2>
            <h3>4.1 The Interplay Mechanism of the Triple Reconfiguration</h3>
            <p>These three mechanisms form a <strong>closed loop of digital mobility</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Visibility Capital → Intergenerational Resource Distribution</strong>: Rural youth, lacking digital literacy, struggle to accumulate visibility capital, placing them at a disadvantage in education and employment;</li>
                <li><strong>Techno-Generational Trauma → Labor Skill Accumulation</strong>: Weak family techno-habitus prevents children from accessing high-quality tech education, confining them to low-skill platform labor;</li>
                <li><strong>Deskilling Trap → Access to Visibility Capital</strong>: Workers, due to skill sinking, cannot transition into content creation or platform operations, further excluded from visibility capital accumulation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This loop reveals the non-linear, asymmetric, and deep-seated inequalities in digital-era social mobility. <strong>Technological change is not a neutral "empowerment" but a structural force reshaping power relations</strong>.</p>
            <h3>4.2 A Policy Framework for "Digital Mobility Justice"</h3>
            <p>To break this loop, we propose a "Digital Mobility Justice" framework:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic Governance</strong> (visibility capital):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Establish "algorithmic impact assessment" mechanisms to regulate platforms’ visibility allocation and prevent algorithmic bias;</li>
                        <li>Explore legislation on "digital identity rights" to protect individuals from algorithmic discrimination, granting "right to be forgotten" and "data portability."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Family Support</strong> (intergenerational trauma):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Establish "Family Digital Support Centers" providing remote guidance, device donations, and resource matching for tech-disadvantaged families;</li>
                        <li>Launch "Intergenerational Tech Dialogue" programs, organizing joint digital skill learning between parents and children to reduce tech anxiety and cognitive conflict.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Skill Certification</strong> (deskilling):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Develop a "Platform Labor Skill Certification System" recognizing transferable skills (e.g., customer service, time management) accumulated on platforms;</li>
                        <li>Promote "Digital Career Portfolios" to record workers’ skills, project experience, and career trajectories, enabling "portable skills."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Digital technological change is systematically reconfiguring the mechanisms of social mobility. We must move beyond the superficial narrative of "digital equality" and confront the structural inequalities underlying "visibility capital," "techno-generational trauma," and the "deskilling trap." Only by shifting social mobility research from "resource distribution" to the deeper dimensions of <strong>cognitive structures, emotional transmission, and technological governance</strong> can we build a truly dignified digital society. <strong>Technology is not fate, but a social contract we write together</strong>.</p>
