            <p>A data-fed piano plays: keys leap with algorithmically assigned precision, spectrogram columns rise and fall to map "emotional peaks."

This absurd cyber-theatre mirrors music's modern allegory — notes once vessels of existential mystery now rule as tyrants over our auditory senses.</p>

                <p>Chopin's triplets in the Funeral March movement of <em>Sonata No.2 in B-flat Minor</em> simultaneously bleed existential queries through melodic fractures and attempt temporal redemption through tremolo mending</p>
            </div>
            <p>Yet in digital music factories, this duality is consumed by unidimensionality. AI composition systems pulverize Prokofiev's mechanical motifs and Ryuichi Sakamoto's minimalism, regurgitating "post-human nocturnes" through affective computing models...</p>
