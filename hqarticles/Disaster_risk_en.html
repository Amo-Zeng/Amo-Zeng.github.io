            <h2>The Relationship Between Disaster Risk and Social Capital</h2>
            <p>In today's globalized world, the frequent occurrence of disaster risks has become a severe challenge faced by the international community. Social capital is considered a key factor in enhancing social resilience and mitigating the impact of disasters.</p>
        </section>

            <h3>The Importance of Social Capital in Disaster Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information Sharing and Communication:</strong> Communities with abundant social capital can quickly disseminate warning information and coordinate emergency responses.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Integration and Allocation:</strong> Social capital can promote the sharing of resources within and between communities, ensuring that critical supplies and services reach the places where they are most needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Cohesion and Resilience:</strong> The accumulation of social capital helps to strengthen community cohesion and enhance residents' adaptability and recovery capacity in the face of disasters.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Differential Analysis of Disaster Risk Among Populations</h3>
            <p>The differential impact of disaster risk primarily manifests among groups with different socioeconomic statuses. Low-income households, marginalized communities, and ethnic minorities often become the primary victims of disasters due to weak infrastructure, inadequate access to information, and lack of social security.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>The Integration of Digital Technology and Disaster Risk</h3>
            <p>The involvement of digital technology is primarily reflected in the precise prediction and assessment of disaster risks. Through big data analysis and artificial intelligence algorithms, we can extract potential patterns of disaster occurrence from massive amounts of data, achieving early warning of disaster risks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Disaster Risk Maps:</strong> Combining meteorological data, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and real-time monitoring networks, a dynamically updated disaster risk map can be constructed.</li>
                <li><strong>Intelligent Rescue Equipment:</strong> The use of unmanned drones, robots, and other intelligent equipment allows rescue operations to surpass traditional human limitations and enter more complex and dangerous disaster scenes.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The relationship between disaster risk and social capital reveals an important pathway to building a resilient society. The integration of digital technology and disaster risk management offers the possibility of constructing a smart approach to disaster prevention. Future disaster management should place greater emphasis on the role of social capital, promoting community self-protection and recovery capabilities through comprehensive strategies.</p>
