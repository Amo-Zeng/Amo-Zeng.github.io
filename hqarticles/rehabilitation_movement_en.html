            <h2>The New Era of Rehabilitation Exercise: From "Exercise Prescription" to "Multi-Integration"</h2>
            <p>As an important means of restoring health, rehabilitation exercise is undergoing profound changes in its models and concepts. Traditional rehabilitation exercise often limited to a single "exercise prescription" model, where patients passively receive treatment, lacking initiative and a sense of participation. However, with technological advancements and social development, rehabilitation exercise is gradually shifting from a single model to multi-integration, emphasizing patients' active participation and social interaction, injecting new vitality into rehabilitation therapy.</p>

            <h3>1. From "Exercise Prescription" to "Exercise Social": The New Model of Rehabilitation Exercise</h3>
            <p>Traditional rehabilitation exercise is often seen as a "prescription" prescribed by doctors or therapists, with patients passively receiving it. However, this model overlooks the social attributes of exercise itself. Combining rehabilitation exercise with social activities can not only increase patients' participation and enthusiasm but also promote communication and mutual assistance among patients, thereby enhancing rehabilitation effects.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1.1 Forming "Rehabilitation Exercise Clubs"</strong>
                    <p>For patients with specific diseases or functional impairments, regular gatherings can be organized for collective exercise and communication. For example, a rehabilitation club for stroke patients can organize regular recovery training sessions, such as balance training and strength training. Patients can share their recovery experiences, encourage each other, and form a mutual support community. This model not only helps patients better adhere to recovery training but also alleviates their loneliness and anxiety.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>1.2 Developing "Rehabilitation Exercise Social Platforms"</strong>
                    <p>Using online platforms, patients can find exercise partners, book classes, share exercise achievements, and even participate in virtual competitions. For example, developing a social platform specifically for rehabilitation patients allows them to post their exercise plans, find like-minded exercise partners, and participate in online or offline recovery training together. Additionally, the platform can provide personalized exercise suggestions and feedback to help patients better manage their recovery process.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>1.3 Combining with Community Activities</strong>
                    <p>Integrating rehabilitation exercise into community activities, such as square dancing and tai chi, allows patients to exercise in a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere. Community activities usually have strong social attributes, where patients can make new friends, share recovery experiences, and enhance their social support network. Moreover, community activities provide a relaxed environment, reducing patients' stress and increasing their recovery motivation.</p>

            <h3>2. From "Passive Treatment" to "Active Participation": The New Thinking of Rehabilitation Exercise</h3>
            <p>Traditional rehabilitation treatment often relies on passive acceptance, with patients lacking initiative and a sense of participation. This model not only limits the effectiveness of rehabilitation but may also lead to resistance to the recovery process. To change this situation, we need to introduce new thinking, encouraging patients to shift from passive treatment to active participation, thereby improving rehabilitation effects and patient satisfaction.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2.1 Introducing "Gamification" Elements</strong>
                    <p>Designing rehabilitation training as a game can greatly increase its fun and challenge, stimulating patients' enthusiasm. For example, using motion-sensing game devices for exercise training allows patients to complete rehabilitation movements through tasks and challenges in the game. This method not only allows patients to exercise in a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere but also enhances their sense of achievement and confidence through the game's reward mechanism. Additionally, gamified rehabilitation training can be personalized based on the patient's specific situation to ensure the training's relevance and effectiveness.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>2.2 Encouraging "Self-Monitoring"</strong>
                    <p>Using wearable devices and mobile applications, patients can record their exercise data in real-time, such as steps, heart rate, and exercise duration, and receive personalized feedback and suggestions. This self-monitoring method helps patients better understand their recovery progress and enhance their self-management abilities. For example, through a smart bracelet or mobile app, patients can set daily exercise goals and view their completion status in real-time. The app can also provide personalized rehabilitation suggestions based on the patient's exercise data, helping them adjust their training plan and improve recovery effects.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>2.3 Providing "Personalized Plans"</strong>
                    <p>Each patient's recovery needs and physical condition are unique, so designing a personalized rehabilitation exercise plan is crucial. Based on the patient's specific situation and needs, rehabilitation experts can design the most suitable recovery plan for the patient and regularly evaluate and adjust it. For example, for stroke patients, the rehabilitation plan can include balance training, strength training, and daily living skills training. Through personalized rehabilitation plans, patients can train more effectively, improving recovery effects.</p>
