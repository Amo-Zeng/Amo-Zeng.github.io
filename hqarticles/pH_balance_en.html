            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Acid-base balance is a critical concept that spans across multiple disciplines, including ecology, biology, chemistry, and engineering. It plays an indispensable role in maintaining natural ecological balance, ensuring human health, and optimizing industrial production processes. By deeply understanding the formation mechanisms of acid-base balance and its potential disruptions, we can adopt a series of scientific and effective repair and optimization strategies to address the challenges it presents in various fields.</p>

            <h3>Applications at the Ecosystem Level</h3>
            <p>At the ecosystem level, the formation and spread of acid rain pose serious threats to key ecological elements such as forests, lakes, and soil. However, ecosystems themselves possess certain natural buffering capacities, such as calcium carbonate in soil and organic acids in plant leaves, which can mitigate the harm caused by acid rain to some extent. Through ecological engineering techniques, such as planting acid-tolerant plants, improving soil, and restoring wetlands, we can gradually restore damaged ecosystems and reduce the long-term environmental impacts of acid rain.</p>

            <h3>Applications in Human Health</h3>
            <p>In terms of human health, maintaining acid-base balance is crucial for preventing chronic diseases. The excessive accumulation of acidic substances in modern dietary structures can lead to health issues such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. By adjusting dietary habits, increasing the intake of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes, and reducing the consumption of processed foods, we can effectively neutralize acidic substances in the body and maintain a healthy acid-base balance.</p>
