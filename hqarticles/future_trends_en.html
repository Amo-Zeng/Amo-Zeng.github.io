            <h3>The Dual Revolution of Digital Identity and Privacy</h3>
            <h4>Technical Background</h4>
            <p>Traditional authentication systems like passwords and fingerprints, while providing basic security, still face risks such as data breaches and identity theft. Passwords can be cracked, and fingerprints can be replicated, posing threats to personal privacy and potentially leading to financial losses.</p>
            <h4>Core Technology Introduction</h4>
            <p>Blockchain ensures data security, transparency, and immutability through distributed ledger technology.</p>
            <h4>Social and Economic Impact</h4>
            <p>The digital identity revolution will reduce the risks of identity theft and data breaches, while also promoting economic growth.</p>
            <h4>Future Development Direction</h4>
            <p>The future will see more applications of blockchain-based identity management systems.</p>

            <h3>Emotional Economics</h3>
            <h4>How AI and Big Data Capture and Analyze Emotions</h4>
            <p>For example, an e-commerce platform can analyze a user's time spent on product pages, browsing patterns, and click behavior to identify their emotional state, thereby recommending products that fit their emotional needs.</p>
