            <h3>Reconstructing the Academic Ecosystem: Challenges and Opportunities</h3>
            <p>To break the academic dilemma in the digital age, systemic reforms are essential. First, we must break the digital shackles of the academic evaluation system and establish a diversified academic evaluation system, eliminating the single standard of "thesis-centered" evaluation.</p>
