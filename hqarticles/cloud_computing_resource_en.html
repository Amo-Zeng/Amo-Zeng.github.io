            <h3>I: Liquid Computing: The Ultimate Form of Cloud Resource Fluidity and On-Demand Allocation</h3>
            <p>In today's world swept by the digital torrent, the demand for computing resources fluctuates like tides. Under traditional cloud computing models, resources are pre-allocated in fixed "containers," making it difficult to meet the ever-changing business needs. "Liquid computing," as a new computing paradigm, is redefining the future of cloud computing with its unique fluidity and on-demand allocation characteristics.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core Concept of Liquid Computing:</strong> Treating computing resources as a "fluid" that can freely flow, morph, and allocate.</li>
                <li><strong>On-Demand Allocation, Unleashing Computing Potential:</strong> Real-time allocation and adjustment of computing resources to maximize resource utilization.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Challenges and Future Outlook:</strong> With the continuous development of 5G, edge computing, artificial intelligence, and other technologies, liquid computing will have an even broader application prospect.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II: Cloud Democratization: A New Era of Technology for All</h3>
            <p>Cloud computing, once an unattainable technical term, is now undergoing a profound transformation, named with a hopeful term: democratization. It is no longer just the technical patent of large enterprises but is gradually entering ordinary homes, becoming a universal tool for social progress.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Breaking Down Technological Barriers:</strong> Democratization of cost, technology, and operations is gradually being realized.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Transformation and Inclusive Effects:</strong> Cloud democratization offers new opportunities for individual developers, small and medium-sized enterprises, research institutions, and social governance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>III: Cloud-Native Civilization: Reconstruction of Civilization and New Social Forms in the Digital Era</h3>
            <p>Every major leap in human society has been accompanied by the innovation of production tools and the reshaping of production relations. From agricultural civilization to industrial civilization, and then to information civilization, technological progress has continuously propelled human society to a higher level. Now, we are at a new historical juncture: the large-scale application of cloud computing technology is leading human society from information civilization to "cloud-native civilization."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cloud Computing: The Technological Foundation of Cloud-Native Civilization:</strong> Features such as computational democratization, data capitalization, and application agility drive social change.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Landscape of Cloud-Native Civilization:</strong> Transformation of production methods, change in lifestyle, and innovation in ways of thinking.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenges and Choices: The Future Path of Cloud-Native Civilization:</strong> Bridging the digital divide, ensuring data security, and addressing ethical challenges require collective efforts.</li>
            </ul>
