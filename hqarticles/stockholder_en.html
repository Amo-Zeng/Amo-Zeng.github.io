            <h2>From Shareholder Primacy to Value Co-Creation: Paradigm Shift in Corporate Governance</h2>
            <p>For a long time, the "shareholder primacy" concept has dominated modern corporate governance, viewing the maximization of shareholder interests as the primary or even sole goal of the enterprise. However, in today's rapidly changing times, this concept is facing unprecedented challenges, and a new corporate governance paradigm—**"value co-creation"**—is emerging. This paradigm emphasizes that the enterprise, as an integral part of society, not only relies on the interests of shareholders but also requires the joint participation and value creation of all stakeholders.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>I. The Limitations of the Shareholder Primacy Concept</h3>
            <p>The shareholder primacy concept originated from the rise of shareholder capitalism in the 1970s, emphasizing the rights of shareholders as owners of the enterprise. However, the limitations of this concept are increasingly apparent:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Short-term orientation, harming long-term development:</strong> Excessive pursuit of short-term financial returns may lead enterprises to cut R&D investments, reduce employee benefits, and lower product quality, weakening core competitiveness and harming long-term development.</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring stakeholders, exacerbating social conflicts:</strong> Ignoring the rights of employees, customers, suppliers, and communities may exacerbate social inequalities, damaging the reputation and competitiveness of the enterprise.</li>
                <li><strong>Accumulation of systemic risks:</strong> Excessive reliance on short-term financial indicators may cause enterprises and investors to overlook potential risks, leading to asset bubbles, overheating of the economy, and other systemic risks.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>II. Value Co-Creation: A New Paradigm in Corporate Governance</h3>
            <p>The value co-creation concept holds that the success of an enterprise depends on the joint participation and value creation of all stakeholders. This concept emphasizes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The rise of the stakeholder community:</strong> Employees, customers, suppliers, and communities are indispensable components of the enterprise. Only by establishing mutually beneficial relationships with them can sustainable development be achieved.</li>
                <li><strong>The deepening of sustainable development concepts:</strong> Global issues such as environmental pollution, resource depletion, and wealth disparity are becoming increasingly severe. Society has higher expectations for enterprises, requiring them to create economic value while also taking on corresponding social responsibilities.</li>
                <li><strong>The vigorous development of business model innovation:</strong> The emergence of new business models such as platform economy and sharing economy provides enterprises with new ways of value creation and also offers more possibilities for stakeholders to co-create value.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>III. Pathways from Shareholder Primacy to Value Co-Creation</h3>
            <p>Achieving the paradigm shift from shareholder primacy to value co-creation requires the joint efforts of enterprises and society as a whole:</p>
            <h4>1. Enterprise Level:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Establishing a sound corporate governance structure:</strong> Including stakeholders in the decision-making process, establishing diversified stakeholder communication mechanisms to ensure that the interests of all parties are fully considered.</li>
                <li><strong>Formulating long-term development strategies:</strong> Balancing short-term and long-term interests, integrating sustainable development concepts into all aspects of business operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Actively fulfilling social responsibilities:</strong> Setting sustainable development goals, incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into investment decisions, and promoting cultural changes in enterprises.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening communication with stakeholders:</strong> Building trust relationships, jointly addressing challenges, and achieving value co-creation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Shareholder Level:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>From "voting with your feet" to "activist shareholderism":</strong> Shareholders should actively participate in corporate governance, proposing motions, exercising voting rights, and communicating with management to actively participate in corporate decision-making and promote governance improvements.</li>
                <li><strong>Adopting a long-term investment philosophy:</strong> Focusing on the long-term value creation of companies rather than short-term stock price fluctuations, growing together with enterprises.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Social Level:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improving relevant laws and regulations:</strong> Creating a favorable external environment for enterprises, encouraging and supporting corporate participation in public welfare undertakings, and enhancing corporate social responsibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening investor education:</strong> Guiding investors to adopt a long-term investment philosophy and focus on the sustainable development of enterprises.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>IV. Future Outlook</h3>
            <p>Value co-creation represents a new trend in corporate governance, but it is not a complete negation of the shareholder primacy concept; rather, it is a supplement and improvement to it. In the future, enterprises will need to seek a balance between shareholder interests and the interests of other stakeholders, achieving the common enhancement of economic and social values.</p>
            <p>In this process, the government, enterprises, investors, and all sectors of society need to work together to promote the establishment of a more equitable and sustainable economic development model, contributing to the progress of human society.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The transition from shareholder primacy to value co-creation represents a profound transformation in the corporate governance paradigm and is an inevitable choice of the times. Only by顺应时代潮流，积极拥抱变革，can enterprises remain competitive in the future and create greater value for society.</p>
