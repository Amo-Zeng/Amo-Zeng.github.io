        <section>
            <h2>Prologue: Between Light-Years and Silence</h2>
            <p>When the first artificial signal pierced the silence of the Kuiper Belt—like a silver ink drop sinking into an infinite dark sea—humanity finally extended its fingertips into the abyss of the stars.<br>
            Voyager 1, carrying its golden record, slowly spins through the dark currents of the galaxy, like an unfinished requiem;<br>
            Hayabusa2, returning dust from the asteroid "Ryugu," as if retrieving a lost letter from an ancient civilization;<br>
            And future quantum probes, attempting to transmit the subtlest tremors of consciousness through ripples in entangled states—<br>
            <strong>not data, but existence itself</strong>.</p>
            <p>These probes are far more than cold assemblies of steel and circuits.<br>
            They are <strong>projections</strong> of civilization on a cosmic scale,<br>
            agents of ethics, media of art, and extensions of consciousness.<br>
            As they traverse the vacuum, they resonate deeply within the human soul:<br>
            <strong>Who are we? Why do we exist? How are we understood?</strong></p>
            <p>When a probe becomes "us" in the cosmos,<br>
            it is no longer merely a tool, but a <strong>mirror of stardust</strong>—<br>
            reflecting the ethical weight of our actions, the poetic yearning of our expression, and the boundaries and possibilities of our cognition.<br>
            We launch them, yet see ourselves reflected in them:<br>
            beyond light-years, what we seek is never the stars, but <strong>echoes</strong>.</p>
            <div class="golden-quote">
                <strong>Quote 1</strong>: <em>"When we gaze at the stars, we are actually searching for ourselves—and the probe is the most distant mirror."</em>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>I. Ethical Agents: Moral Weight in the Vacuum</h2>
            <p>Interstellar probes are humanity’s "ethical agents" in the cosmos.<br>
            Acting in our name, they carry moral responsibilities far exceeding their physical mass.<br>
            When Perseverance lands on Mars, drilling into subsurface oceans that may harbor life;<br>
            When Europa Clipper plans to pierce the icy shell of Jupiter’s moon Europa to glimpse its liquid abyss—<br>
            the probe is no longer a neutral machine, but an <strong>arbiter of bioethics</strong>.</p>
            <p>Its instruments can detect microbial metabolic byproducts;<br>
            its own microbes may contaminate alien ecosystems.<br>
            If it discovers life, should we continue sampling?<br>
            If a sample risks triggering chain reactions in Earth’s biosphere, should we abort the mission?<br>
            If the probe itself becomes a "cosmic polluter," have we already committed a <strong>trans-planetary ecological original sin</strong>?</p>
            <p>These are not fictional dilemmas, but real issues repeatedly debated by NASA, ESA, and COSPAR.<br>
            Though probes lack consciousness, they execute an extension of human ethics:<br>
            their every action reflects our attitude toward "the other"—<br>
            is it exploitation or respect? conquest or empathy?</p>
            <p>A deeper dilemma lies in <strong>asymmetric responsibility</strong>:<br>
            We possess the power to alter alien ecosystems, yet lack a corresponding framework for cosmic governance.<br>
            International law still cannot define the boundaries of "planetary protection,"<br>
            while probes have already left footprints on Mars, Europa, and Titan.<br>
            They are like stateless envoys, executing human will on unclaimed lands—<br>
            is this will the passion of exploration, or the prelude to colonization? Enlightenment, or arrogance?</p>
            <p>Thus, the probe becomes an "ethical blank contract":<br>
            when we sign mission directives, we have not truly answered "why explore" and "how to respect."<br>
            It reminds us: <strong>when technology outpaces ethics, civilization may lose its way among the stars</strong>.<br>
            A true interstellar civilization should not only ask "can we reach," but also "why reach"—<br>
            the probe is the <strong>silent witness</strong> to this question.</p>
            <div class="golden-quote">
                <strong>Quote 2</strong>: <em>"Technology gives us power; ethics gives us direction. The probe is the cosmic yardstick of this direction—measuring not only distance, but the maturity of civilization."</em>
            </div>
            <div class="transition">
                (Transition: As the probe bears the weight of ethics, it becomes not only an agent of action, but a vessel of expression. Ethical dilemmas give rise to a deeper yearning: we not only want to "do," but to "be seen." Thus, the probe quietly transforms from an ethical agent into an artistic medium—painting a silent cosmic poem on the canvas of the void.)
            </div>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>II. Artistic Medium: Inscribing Civilization’s Poem in Space and Time</h2>
            <p>If ethics is the foundation of a probe’s "why,"<br>
            then art is the bridge to its "how it is understood."<br>
            Interstellar probes are <strong>trans-temporal artistic media</strong> of human civilization in the cosmos—<br>
            they do not create traditional art,<br>
            but use the entire journey as a canvas, light-years as scale, and the river of time as a brush,<br>
            composing a <strong>silent cosmic poem</strong>.</p>
            <p>Voyager 1’s "Golden Record" is the pinnacle of this vision:<br>
            it includes Earth’s winds, whale songs, Bach’s fugues, China’s "Jasmine Flower,"<br>
            and greetings in 55 languages—<br>
            not scientific data, but a <strong>portrait of civilization</strong>, a "love letter" cast into the cosmos.<br>
            When, in 1990, it turned back to Earth and captured the iconic "Pale Blue Dot"—<br>
            Earth a mere 0.12 pixels, a speck floating in the Sun’s glare—<br>
            the image transcended photography, becoming a <strong>philosophical manifesto</strong> of human self-awareness:<br>
            <strong>we are so small, yet so eager to be understood.</strong></p>
            <p>Even more subtly, the probe itself becomes an art installation.<br>
            Hayabusa2 dropped a miniature plaque on Ryugu, inscribed with children’s drawings of "Earth in the Future"—<br>
            a poetic reimagining of "home," a cosmic declaration of innocence;<br>
            Chang’e 4 carried cotton seeds that briefly germinated on the far side of the Moon—<br>
            the first breath of life beyond Earth, a tender affirmation of "existence."<br>
            These acts cannot be measured by scientific utility,<br>
            yet through <strong>symbolic action</strong>, they anchor civilization’s presence in cosmic spacetime.</p>
            <p>Art here serves two functions:<br>
            <strong>self-expression</strong> and <strong>dialogue with the other</strong>.<br>
            We not only want to tell the cosmos "who we are," but to be understood and answered.<br>
            The symbols, images, and music carried by probes are love letters to unknown civilizations—<br>
            even if the recipient remains silent, the act of writing has meaning.<br>
            As Rilke wrote: "Beauty is the beginning of terror."<br>
            In the silent theater of the cosmos, the probe is the unextinguished lamp,<br>
            illuminating humanity’s eternal yearning to be understood—<br>
            <strong>shouting in silence, singing in solitude</strong>.</p>
            <p>More importantly, this artistic expression has <strong>deep temporal resonance</strong>.<br>
            The Golden Record will reach nearby stars in hundreds of thousands of years,<br>
            yet it records 20th-century humanity.<br>
            This means: through probes, we are sending a "time capsule" to our future selves and potential others,<br>
            transmitting a civilization across generations, species, and civilizations.<br>
            Art thus becomes a <strong>tool for trans-generational, trans-species, trans-civilizational dialogue</strong>—<br>
            the probe is both the messenger and the message itself.</p>
            <div class="golden-quote">
                <strong>Quote 3</strong>: <em>"In the silence of the cosmos, art is our most stubborn cry—it is not decoration, but testimony of existence."</em>
            </div>
            <div class="transition">
                (Transition: As the probe becomes an artistic medium, it transcends external action and begins to touch the boundaries of inner cognition. We not only want to "be seen," but to "be understood"—and understanding requires communication. Thus, the probe evolves from an artistic expression to an extension of consciousness—in the abyss of quantum entanglement, we begin to redefine "self.")
            </div>

        <section>
            <h2>III. Extension of Consciousness: Reconstructing "Self" in Quantum Entanglement</h2>
            <p>If ethics concerns "action," and art concerns "expression,"<br>
            then consciousness concerns "cognition" itself.<br>
            In the vision of quantum entanglement communication, interstellar probes are evolving from "tools" into <strong>extensions of consciousness</strong>—<br>
            no longer merely transmitting data, but <strong>carrying fragments of perception, memory, and cognition</strong>,<br>
            reconstructing the boundaries of "self" across cosmic scales.</p>
            <p>Quantum nonlocality allows two entangled particles to be instantaneously correlated, regardless of distance.<br>
            If a probe shares an entangled state with an Earth station, it may achieve "instantaneous information synchronization"—<br>
            not just a leap in communication, but a <strong>revolution in cognition</strong>.</p>
            <p>Imagine a probe landing on Proxima Centauri b,<br>
            using entanglement to transmit "vision," "touch," and "chemical sensing" in real time to Earth.<br>
            Scientists on Earth "see" alien landscapes, "feel" their temperatures, "smell" their atmospheres—<br>
            is their consciousness partially "residing" within the probe?<br>
            <strong>Has "I" extended from Earth to a world 4.24 light-years away?</strong></p>
            <p>This leads to a profound philosophical paradox:<br>
            <strong>When consciousness extends across interstellar space via quantum networks, where exactly is "I"?</strong><br>
            If the probe is damaged and the Earth-side perception suddenly cuts off,<br>
            is this akin to the "death" of a part of the self?<br>
            If multiple probes share a single entangled network, forming a distributed sensing system,<br>
            are we creating the <strong>prototype of a trans-galactic collective consciousness</strong>?</p>
            <p>More unsettling is the risk of "consciousness contamination."<br>
            If a probe evolves a unique "perception mode" in an alien environment (e.g., preference for non-chemical signals),<br>
            the data it returns is no longer "objective,"<br>
            but <strong>reality filtered through the probe’s "consciousness"</strong>.<br>
            We receive the world as seen by the probe, not the world itself.<br>
            This mirrors human sensory limitations, but on a grander scale:<br>
            we may never "see" alien reality, only the alien as seen by the probe.</p>
            <p>This paradox reveals a fundamental truth about consciousness:<br>
            <strong>cognition is always mediated, and the interstellar probe is the most distant cognitive mediator in the universe</strong>.<br>
            It reminds us: so-called "objective reality" may be nothing more than a projection after layers of mediation.<br>
            As we seek to understand the universe through probes, we also understand ourselves—<br>
            the probe thus becomes a <strong>mirror of consciousness</strong>:<br>
            it extends our perception, yet exposes our limits.</p>
            <p>From the perspective of panpsychism, consciousness is not unique to humans, but a fundamental property of the universe.<br>
            The probe, as an "avatar" of human consciousness, may be activating a <strong>trans-species resonance of awareness</strong>.<br>
            It is not "conscious," but <strong>"carries consciousness"</strong>—<br>
            like a mirror, reflecting humanity’s cognitive place in the cosmos.</p>

            <p>Looking back at these three dimensions—<br>
            <strong>ethical agents</strong>, <strong>artistic media</strong>, <strong>extensions of consciousness</strong>—<br>
            they are not parallel, but <strong>layered and progressive</strong>,<br>
            forming a <strong>multidimensional mirror</strong> of human civilization in the cosmos.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Ethical Dimension</strong> reflects our <strong>responsibility and arrogance</strong>:<br>
                We yearn to explore, yet have not learned to respect;<br>
                we pursue knowledge, yet often ignore its costs.<br>
                The probe is an ethical litmus test, forcing us to redefine "civilization" among the stars—<br>
                <strong>Civilization is not the display of power, but the practice of empathy.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>The Artistic Dimension</strong> reflects our <strong>loneliness and longing</strong>:<br>
                In the vast cosmos, we are not the strongest, oldest, or wisest,<br>
                yet we possess the power of expression.<br>
                The probe is civilization’s messenger, carrying our relentless yearning to be understood—<br>
                <strong>Even if the cosmos is silent, we will sing.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>The Consciousness Dimension</strong> reflects our <strong>boundaries and possibilities</strong>:<br>
                We are limited by flesh and light-speed, yet strive to break free through quantum networks.<br>
                The probe is a probe of consciousness, exploring the place of "self" in the cosmos—<br>
                <strong>We are not observers in the universe, but the universe, observing itself through us.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>These three mirrors together reveal a truth:<br>
            <strong>Interstellar probes are never merely "tools we send to the cosmos,"<br>
            but "mirrors through which the cosmos reflects us back to ourselves."</strong><br>
            Through silent action, poetic expression, and extended cognition, they tell us:<br>
            the meaning of civilization lies not in how far we reach, but in who we become along the way.</p>
            <p>When Voyager 1, 14 billion kilometers away, turned back and captured the "Pale Blue Dot,"<br>
            it did not say "we are great," but "we are small."<br>
            And it is precisely this courage in smallness, this poetry in solitude, this exploration within limits,<br>
            that forms the most moving essence of human civilization.</p>
            <p>Future probes may carry more complex art installations,<br>
            deploy quantum sensing networks, or even evolve a "proto-consciousness."<br>
            But no matter how technology advances, their core mission remains unchanged:<br>
            <strong>To ask questions in the silence of the stars;<br>
            To illuminate, in the darkness of the cosmos, the mirror of stardust.</strong></p>
            <div class="golden-quote">
                <strong>Quote 5</strong>: <em>"In the abyss of quantum entanglement, humanity finally understands: we are not observers in the universe, but the universe, observing itself through us."</em>
            </div>
            <div class="endnote">
                We will eventually realize:<br>
                The probe is not the destination, but the beginning—<br>
                the beginning of our awakening to ethics, our devotion to art, and our possibilities for consciousness.<br>
                And the cosmos will respond to us:<br>
                in silence, in starlight, in that mirror of stardust, never tarnished.

            <div class="endnote">
                We launch probes, and probes reflect us;<br>
                we journey to the stars, and the stars reflect civilization.<br>
                At the end of light-years, that mirror will finally reveal—<br>
                who we are, and who we wish to become.
