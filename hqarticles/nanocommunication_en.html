            <h3>Applications of Environmental Sensing in Nanocommunication</h3>
            <p>The application of environmental sensing technology in nanocommunication is mainly reflected in the following aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Energy Harvesting:</strong> Energy harvesters based on nanomaterials can collect energy from the environment, such as solar, thermal, and mechanical energy, providing stable energy supply for nanocommunication systems. For example, using the photoelectric effect of nanocrystals, solar energy can be converted into electrical energy to drive nanocommunication devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Information Sensing:</strong> Nanosensors are used to sense physical and chemical information (such as temperature, humidity, and gas composition) in the environment, converting it into communication signals to achieve real-time environmental monitoring and data transmission. For instance, in smart cities, nanosensors can monitor air quality in real-time and transmit data to a central control system, providing scientific basis for environmental governance.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmentally Adaptive Communication:</strong> Nanocommunication systems can adaptively adjust communication strategies based on environmental changes (such as signal interference and obstacle occlusion), such as switching communication frequencies or changing signal encoding methods, thereby improving communication reliability and stability. For example, in complex urban environments, nanocommunication systems can dynamically adjust signal transmission paths based on real-time environmental data to ensure smooth information transmission.</li>
