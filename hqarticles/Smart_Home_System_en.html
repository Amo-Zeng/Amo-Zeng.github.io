The smart home system awakened by Matter protocol begins its symphony: Nest Thermostat locks room temperature in "optimal curves", Roomba plans cleaning routes based on historical data, Oura Ring detects light sleep stages and adjusts mattress pressure – what survival philosophy does this seemingly perfect "digital morning concerto" ultimately signify?</p>
