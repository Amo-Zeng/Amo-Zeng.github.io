            <h2>Co-evolution of Global Urban Planning: Civilizational Dialogue and Institutional Innovation at the Interface of Conflict</h2>
            <p>Urban planning in the context of globalization has evolved into a complex trans-civilizational practice field, where institutional dialogue between different governance paradigms in spatial production forms its essence. This paper reveals how urban planning transforms cultural tensions into innovative momentum through technological-political mechanisms using a reconstructed three-dimensional analytical framework of "Conflict-Transformation-Co-evolution." It proposes "institutional translation capacity" as a new indicator for evaluating the effectiveness of transnational planning cooperation.</p>

            <h3>I. Translation Mechanism of Cultural Conflict: From Symbolic Confrontation to Meta-rule Symbiosis</h3>
            <p>The cultural conflict in urban planning fundamentally results from the paradigm incommensurability in spatial production logics. Take NEOM City as an example: the collision between the Japanese team's "Hyper-Fluid City" concept (maximizing spatial efficiency) and Islamic spatial norms of gender separation (prioritizing social order) exposes deep contradictions between modern planning paradigms and non-Western spatial cognition. Through developing culturally adaptive intelligent material systems (e.g., nano-coatings with programmable light transmittance), the project achieved Dynamic Sharia Compliance for spatial functions. Its breakthrough lies in establishing a "technological mediation layer" to dissolve direct value conflicts.</p>
            <p>Singapore's Gardens by the Bay exemplifies a deeper translation logic through its "Controlled Wildness" paradigm: by constructing "meta-rule mapping" between Eastern and Western ecological concepts, it transforms Daoist "non-interference governance" into modular ecological units, while materializing Western scientific management as parametric maintenance systems. This translation doesn't seek value unification but creates a "transcendent spatial syntax" that simultaneously satisfies different cultural expectations.</p>
            <p><strong>Theoretical Contribution:</strong> Proposes a "Cultural Translation Gradient" model to quantitatively evaluate adaptation costs of planning solutions across different cultural contexts.</p>

            <h3>II. Techno-Political Game Theory: Institutional Design of Data Sovereignty</h3>
            <p>The core conflict in smart city development lies in the power restructuring between technological standardization and local knowledge. Barcelona's resistance against Amazon's "City of Tomorrow" demonstrates that when a technology solution's "Institutional Package" contains elements of data colonialism, it triggers civil society's immune response. The failure stems from the lack of "sovereignty-compatible design" — failing to translate the EU GDPR's data localization requirements into the foundational architecture of spatial governance.</p>
            <p>In contrast, the Shenzhen-Singapore Smart City Corridor achieved breakthroughs through "Blockchain Federalism": adopting common protocols (e.g., IEEE P2874 standard) at the infrastructure layer, maintaining sovereignty isolation at the data layer, while allowing cross-domain interoperability at the application layer. This "Onion Model" architecture proves that the solution to techno-political conflicts lies in building "techno-legal complexes" with institutional resilience.</p>
            <p><strong>Methodological Innovation:</strong> Introduces institutional economics' "Modular Separation" theory to establish a sovereignty risk assessment matrix for technology solutions.</p>
        </section>

            <h3>III. Mechanism Design for Planning Diplomacy: Spatial Algorithms for Peacebuilding</h3>
            <p>Urban planning in post-conflict areas essentially transforms political contradictions into computable spatial variables. The success key of the Croatia-Serbia Danube River Project lies in establishing a "depoliticized" planning interface: reaching technical consensus on river ecological restoration (e.g., sediment flow control algorithms) bypasses politically sensitive territorial disputes. Its innovation is developing a "Spatial Equivalent Substitution" mechanism — substituting military functions with economic ones without altering legal status.</p>
            <p>The "Resilient Border" research on the Korean DMZ goes further, reconfiguring the military buffer zone into a dual ecological-economic system. Using space syntax analysis, it demonstrates how specific topological structures (e.g., star-shaped networks) can simultaneously satisfy security needs and economic connectivity, providing political entities with "risk-controlled contact interfaces."</p>
            <p><strong>Policy Tool:</strong> Proposes a "Planning Confidence-Building Measures" (PCBM) framework to gradually reduce conflict intensity through incremental spatial reciprocity.</p>

            <h3>IV. Co-evolution Paradigm: Building Institutional Translation Capacity</h3>
            <p>The core competency for future transnational planning cooperation lies in cultivating "institutional translation capacity," which requires:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Establishing a meta-rule repository for cultural cognition to transform value differences into actionable design parameters</li>
                <li>Developing sovereignty-sensitive technology architecture to achieve dynamic balance between technical efficiency and institutional compatibility</li>
                <li>Designing politically resilient spatial algorithms to make the physical environment serve as a conflict transformation valve</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Research Prospects:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using complex adaptive systems theory to simulate evolutionary paths of different cultural translation strategies</li>
                <li>Developing computational models for measuring institutional friction coefficients of planning schemes</li>
                <li>Building blockchain-based transnational planning credential trading systems</li>
            </ul>
