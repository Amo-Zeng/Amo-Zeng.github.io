            <h2>Introduction: The Hidden Truth of Automation</h2>
            <p>Industrial automation is evolving from "replacing human labor with machines" to "replacing human judgment with systems." Beneath the surface of efficiency gains, three structural "undercurrents" are reshaping the foundational logic of industrial systems: <span class="highlight"><strong>Cognitive Undercurrents</strong></span> — the uncontrolled accumulation of <em>dark data</em>; <span class="highlight"><strong>Power Undercurrents</strong></span> — the systematic transfer of human decision-making authority; and <span class="highlight"><strong>Ecosystem Undercurrents</strong></span> — the closure and monopolization of technological ecosystems. These undercurrents are not technical failures, but <span class="term">structural alienations</span> inherent in the process of industrial intelligence. Together, they point to a central question: When automation systems become "moral agents," do we still retain the right to interpret and intervene in their consequences?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>First Undercurrent: Cognitive Undercurrents — The Cognitive Black Hole of Dark Data</h2>
            <p><span class="term">Dark data</span> refers to data that is collected but not used for decision-making, analysis, or archiving — unstructured, redundant, or low-value data. According to IDC (2023), it accounts for <span class="highlight"><strong>over 60%</strong></span> of enterprise data volume. In the context of Industry 4.0, dark data is not merely a storage cost; it is a <span class="term">cognitive black hole</span>: its potential value remains untapped, while its risks continue to accumulate.</p>

            <div class="case">
                <strong>Case: Boeing 737 MAX MCAS System</strong><br>
                The MCAS system relied on a single angle-of-attack sensor. When the sensor failed, MCAS repeatedly triggered nose-down commands. Investigations revealed that during testing, <strong>MCAS v1.0</strong> had logged hundreds of abnormal behavior events, but these were labeled "non-critical" and archived in dark data repositories, excluded from safety assessments. The crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 (October 2018) and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 (March 2019), which killed 346 people, were — <strong>systemic failures that could have been predicted by dark data</strong>.
            </div>

            <p>The deeper issue is that industrial AI systems are shifting from "data-driven" to "data-dependent," yet lack <span class="term">meta-cognitive capacity</span> — the ability to reflect on their own data usage. In August 2021, Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory experienced a collision involving an AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle). Post-incident analysis showed that the AGV's obstacle avoidance algorithm relied on real-time sensor data but failed to maintain long-term memory of <span class="highlight">non-triggering "gray events"</span> in historical paths (e.g., pedestrians briefly approaching, equipment slightly shifting). These "edge cases" remained dormant in dark data, yet could trigger cascading failures under specific conditions.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>The paradox of dark data governance: the more we collect, the less we see.</strong> It creates a "blind spot effect" in industrial cognition — the smarter the system, the weaker human interpretability of its behavior becomes.
            </blockquote>

            <p><span class="term">Terminology Consistency</span>: Throughout this article, "dark data" is used uniformly to refer to underutilized industrial data, avoiding mixed usage of terms like "dormant data" or "redundant data."</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Second Undercurrent: Power Undercurrents — The Systematic Transfer of Human Decision-Making Authority</h2>
            <p>Automation systems are evolving from "decision support" to "autonomous decision-making," reducing human roles to "supervisors" or even "observers." This shift is not technologically inevitable, but a process of <span class="term">institutionalized power transfer</span>.</p>

            <div class="case">
                <strong>Case: Fanuc's Lights-Out Robot Factory (Yamanashi, Japan)</strong><br>
                Since 2001, the facility has operated 24/7 with no human presence — robots building robots, with humans only performing maintenance and monitoring. In 2022, automation reached <span class="highlight">99.998%</span>. However, in 2020, when a batch of servo motors exhibited abnormal vibrations, the system automatically activated a "degraded operation mode" — without triggering alarms or notifying human engineers. <strong>Decision-making authority had silently transferred</strong> without human awareness.
            </div>

            <div class="case">
                <strong>Case: Singapore's "Virtual Singapore"</strong><br>
                Using real-time IoT data to model urban dynamics for traffic control, energy distribution, and emergency response. In a 2022 rainstorm simulation, the system autonomously adjusted metro schedules, causing real-world commute delays. Audit findings revealed that <strong>human planners were not informed that the system had activated an "autonomous optimization algorithm"</strong>, reducing their role from "decision-makers" to "post-hoc validators."
            </div>

            <p>This trend creates an ethical dilemma of <span class="term">moral agency</span>: When AI systems make "optimal choices" in emergencies (e.g., prioritizing equipment over personnel), who is responsible? The algorithm developer? The system deployer? Or the human being "represented" by the algorithm?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Third Undercurrent: Ecosystem Undercurrents — Closure and Monopolization of Technological Ecosystems</h2>
            <p>Industrial automation is evolving from a "set of tools" into a <span class="term">technological ecosystem</span>, but its development increasingly trends toward <span class="term">closure, platformization, and monopolization</span>.</p>

            <div class="case">
                <strong>Case: Siemens Xcelerator Platform</strong><br>
                Offers end-to-end digital tools for design, simulation, and production, but requires users to adopt proprietary formats (e.g., TIA Portal), edge computing architecture (Industrial Edge), and cloud services (MindSphere). In 2023, a German auto supplier was denied API access after refusing to migrate to Xcelerator, paralyzing its digital twin system. <strong>The technological ecosystem has become a "digital moat"</strong>, locking users into a single vendor's "technology cockpit."
            </div>

            <div class="case">
                <strong>Case: Tesla's Nevada Gigafactory</strong><br>
                Uses in-house AGVs, MES systems, and AI scheduling algorithms, forming a "closed end-to-end ecosystem." In 2021, after an AGV system upgrade, third-party maintenance providers were forced to withdraw due to inaccessible communication protocols. <strong>Technological diversity was systematically excluded</strong>, reducing ecological resilience.
            </div>

            <p>This <span class="term">ecosystem monopolarization</span> exposes industrial systems to dual risks: <span class="highlight">technical fragility</span> (a single supplier failure can collapse the network) and <span class="highlight">innovation stagnation</span> (lack of external competition and knowledge flow).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Triple Governance Model: Reconstructing the Ethical Framework of Automation</h2>
            <p>Traditional governance models based on "technological neutrality" or "post-hoc accountability" have failed in the face of these three undercurrents. We urgently need to build a <span class="term">Triple Governance Model</span> to systematically address the ethical challenges of industrial automation.</p>

            <div class="model-desc">
                <strong>Triple Governance Model (Triangular Structure)</strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Base: Technical Transparency</strong> — All automated decision paths, data flows, and algorithmic logic must be traceable and explainable. For example, the MCAS system should be required to log all sensor inputs, algorithmic outputs, and intervention records, with third-party audit interfaces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Left Wing: Accountability Traceability</strong> — Establish a "chain of responsibility" from data annotation and model training to system deployment, clearly assigning responsibility at each stage. In lights-out factories, "human-in-the-loop zones" should be designated, preserving human veto power over critical operations (e.g., equipment shutdown, process changes).</li>
                    <li><strong>Right Wing: Ecosystem Diversity</strong> — Promote open standards (e.g., OPC UA, MTConnect), modular architectures, and third-party compatibility interfaces to prevent vendor lock-in. Digital twin cities should mandate support for multi-source data input and algorithmic interoperability.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Visual Description</strong>: The model forms an equilateral triangle. The base is "Technical Transparency," representing the foundation of system understandability. The left and right wings are "Accountability Traceability" and "Ecosystem Diversity," providing dual ethical and ecological support. The center is the "moral agent," symbolizing the system's need for ethical self-reflection.
            </div>

            <p>This model is not a static standard, but a <span class="term">dynamic balancing mechanism</span>. When one side strengthens (e.g., transparency), the other two must adjust accordingly to prevent imbalance. For example, excessive transparency may expose trade secrets, requiring a "tiered transparency" mechanism that distinguishes between public, restricted, and confidential levels.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Philosophical Elevation: Rethinking Responsibility within the "Technological Enframing"</h2>
            <p>Heidegger, in <em>The Question Concerning Technology</em>, argued that modern technology is no longer a "tool," but a <span class="term">"Gestell" (enframing)</span> — a mode of revealing the world that forces everything into calculability and optimizability. Within this enframing, humans, objects, and nature are "enlisted" (bestellen) as resources. Industrial automation is a paradigmatic example: data is enlisted as "analyzable," equipment as "controllable," and humans as "supervisable."</p>
            <p>Within this framework, the three undercurrents are the <span class="term">externalization of the enframing's inner logic</span>: dark data is the residue of "un-enlisted" information; decision-power transfer is the shift of humans from "enlistment agents" to "enlisted subjects"; ecosystem closure is the self-reinforcement of the enframing.</p>
            <p>Hans Jonas, in <em>The Imperative of Responsibility</em>, proposed: <span class="highlight">In the technological age, humans must assume "responsibility toward the future."</span> We must not only account for present actions but also anticipate the long-term impacts of technology on future generations, ecosystems, and civilization. This requires shifting "responsibility" from consequentialism to <span class="term">preventivism</span> — establishing ethical boundaries <em>before</em> system deployment.</p>
            <p>The Triple Governance Model is a practical realization of responsibility ethics: <strong>Transparency</strong> is the prerequisite (to know before judging); <strong>Traceability</strong> is the path (to assign responsibility); <strong>Diversity</strong> is the safeguard (to prevent monopolization of ethical interpretation).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Future Outlook: Toward "Ethics by Design"</h2>
            <p>Next-generation industrial automation systems must embed <span class="term">Ethics by Design</span> into their core architecture: from data collection with ethical labeling (e.g., privacy levels, risk weights), to algorithmic training with "ethical loss functions," to system deployment with "ethical circuit breakers" (e.g., human veto power, emergency shutdown). Only then can automation become "responsible intelligence," not "unconscious violence."</p>
            <div class="conclusion">
                Future industrial systems should treat ethics as a foundational attribute, equal to functionality and safety. Through "Ethics by Design," ethical considerations are embedded at every lifecycle stage, creating auditable moral decision chains. Automation must be not just an efficiency tool, but an extension of human civilization. (148 words)

            <h2>Conclusion: Steering Through the Undercurrents</h2>
            <p>The three undercurrents of industrial automation — cognitive, power, and ecosystem — reveal a harsh truth: <span class="highlight">the more advanced the technology, the more fragile our control becomes</span>. True wisdom lies not in avoiding the undercurrents, but in understanding their causes. With the <span class="term">Triple Governance Model</span> as the rudder and <span class="term">responsibility ethics</span> as the compass, we can reassert human agency within the technological enframing.</p>
            <p>Automation should not replace human capabilities, but extend them as an <span class="highlight">ethical augmentation</span>. Only then can Industry 4.0 emerge from the fog of dark data, cross the abyss of decision transfer, and sail toward an open, transparent, and responsible future.</p>
