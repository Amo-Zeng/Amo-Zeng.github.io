            <h3>4. From "End-of-Pipe Treatment" to "Source Reduction": Building a Lifecycle Management System for Solid Waste</h3>
            <p>With the acceleration of global urbanization and the rise in consumption levels, the issue of solid waste has become increasingly severe. Traditional "end-of-pipe treatment" models, though providing some relief to the pressure of solid waste disposal, are costly, have limited effectiveness, and cause secondary environmental pollution, making them unsustainable. To address this challenge, shifting the focus from "end-of-pipe treatment" to "source reduction" and constructing a lifecycle management system covering product design, production, consumption, and recycling is a crucial path to achieving sustainable development.</p>
            <h4>4.1 Product Design: The Leading Role of Green Design</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Design for Easy Dismantling and Recycling:</strong> Traditional product design often ignores lifecycle management, making it difficult to effectively dismantle and recycle products once they reach the end of their life. Green design emphasizes considering the entire lifecycle’s resource consumption and environmental impact during the design phase. Modular design and standardized interfaces make products easier to dismantle, thereby improving recycling rates.</li>
                <li><strong>Using Renewable and Biodegradable Materials:</strong> Choosing renewable and biodegradable materials in product design is an important means of reducing solid waste. The use of biodegradable plastics and bamboo products not only reduces reliance on oil but also significantly lowers the environmental impact of solid waste. Additionally, the use of eco-friendly materials aligns with consumer demand for sustainable products, further driving market green transformation.</li>
                <li><strong>Lengthening Product Lifespan to Reduce Waste:</strong> The durability and repairability of products are key considerations in green design. By enhancing durability, the premature disposal of products due to quality issues is reduced. By improving repairability, the product’s lifespan is extended. For instance, many appliance companies now offer product repair services, encouraging users to repair rather than discard products when faults occur. This not only reduces the generation of solid waste but also lowers resource consumption.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>4.2 Production Process: The Implementation Path of Clean Production</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adopting High Resource Efficiency and Low Emission Production Techniques:</strong> Resource consumption and pollution emissions during production are major sources of solid waste. By introducing clean production technology, businesses can reduce waste generation at the source. For example, closed-loop production systems maximize the recycling of by-products and waste from the production process, reducing reliance on raw materials. Additionally, improving production techniques reduces energy consumption and pollution emissions, achieving green production processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Production Process Management to Reduce Material Loss and Waste Generation:</strong> Material loss and waste generation during the production process are significant sources of solid waste. By strengthening production process management, businesses can effectively reduce these wastes. For instance, adopting lean production management models optimizes production flows, minimizing unnecessary material waste. Strict quality control reduces defect rates, lowering the generation of unnecessary solid waste.</li>
                <li><strong>Implementing Solid Waste Sorting at Source for Easier Resourceful Utilization:</strong> Sorting and resourceful utilization of solid waste during production are crucial for achieving "source reduction." By sorting solid waste at the source, businesses can directly reuse recyclable materials in production, reducing reliance on external resources. For example, metal processing companies can sort and recycle metal waste at the source.</li>
