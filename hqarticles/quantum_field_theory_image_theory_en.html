            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an important extension theory in particle physics, aiming to address some fundamental issues in the Standard Model (SM), such as the hierarchy problem and the naturalness problem. By introducing supersymmetric partner particles (sparticles) corresponding to Standard Model particles, Supersymmetry offers an elegant mechanism for Electroweak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB). However, despite its theoretical appeal, the experimental verification of Supersymmetry faces significant challenges. This article will start with the explanation of Electroweak Symmetry Breaking by Supersymmetry, explore the impact of new Supersymmetry breaking mechanisms (such as string theory and brane world), and study the detection strategies of supersymmetric particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and their influence on experimental observations.</p>

            <h3>Supersymmetry and Electroweak Symmetry Breaking</h3>
            <h4>Basic Concepts of Supersymmetry</h4>
            <p>Supersymmetry introduces a supersymmetric transformation into the Standard Model, associating each fermion with a boson and vice versa. This symmetry requires the existence of supersymmetric partner particles with masses equal to their Standard Model counterparts. For example, the electron (fermion) corresponds to a "selectron" (boson), and the gluon (boson) corresponds to a "gluino" (fermion).</p>
            <h4>Traditional Mechanisms of Electroweak Symmetry Breaking</h4>
            <p>In the Standard Model, Electroweak Symmetry Breaking is achieved through the Higgs mechanism, where the Higgs field acquires a non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV), giving masses to the W and Z bosons while leaving the photon massless. However, the Higgs mechanism in the Standard Model suffers from the hierarchy problem, where the mass of the Higgs particle requires fine-tuning to avoid large quantum corrections. Supersymmetry naturally suppresses these quantum corrections by introducing supersymmetric partner particles, thus resolving the hierarchy problem.</p>
            <h4>Supersymmetry Breaking Mechanisms</h4>
            <p>Although Supersymmetry has many theoretical advantages, one of its core issues is how to achieve Supersymmetry breaking. Traditional Supersymmetry breaking mechanisms include the O'Raifeartaigh model, dynamical breaking, and hidden sector SUSY breaking. In these mechanisms, the information of Supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to Standard Model particles through some intermediate media (such as gauge fields or gravity), thereby giving mass to supersymmetric partner particles.</p>

            <h3>New Supersymmetry Breaking Mechanisms: String Theory and Brane World</h3>
            <h4>Supersymmetry Breaking in String Theory</h4>
            <p>String theory, as a candidate for quantum gravity, naturally includes Supersymmetry. In string theory, Supersymmetry breaking can be achieved through geometric mechanisms, such as boundary conditions in Anti-de Sitter space (AdS/CFT correspondence) or different vacuum states in the string landscape. Supersymmetry breaking mechanisms in string theory provide new perspectives for studying Electroweak Symmetry Breaking. For example, by studying different vacuum states in the string landscape, one can explore changes in the supersymmetric particle spectrum and their impact on Electroweak Symmetry Breaking.</p>
            <h4>Brane World and Supersymmetry Breaking</h4>
            <p>The Brane World Theory is a theoretical framework of higher-dimensional space, where Standard Model particles are confined to a three-dimensional brane, while gravity can propagate in higher dimensions. In the Brane World Theory, Supersymmetry breaking can be achieved through interactions between branes or dynamical mechanisms in higher-dimensional space. For example, by studying the transmission mechanisms of Supersymmetry breaking between different branes, one can explore changes in the supersymmetric particle spectrum and their impact on Electroweak Symmetry Breaking.</p>
            <h4>Impact of New Breaking Mechanisms on Electroweak Symmetry Breaking</h4>
            <p>New Supersymmetry breaking mechanisms (such as string theory and brane world) provide new tools and ideas for studying Electroweak Symmetry Breaking. These mechanisms not only explain the mass spectrum of supersymmetric particles but also provide new dynamic sources for Electroweak Symmetry Breaking. For example, by studying different vacuum states in string theory, one can explore the mass distribution of supersymmetric particles and its impact on Electroweak Symmetry Breaking. Additionally, the higher-dimensional space mechanism in the Brane World Theory may provide new constraint conditions for the mass spectrum of supersymmetric particles.</p>

            <h3>Detection Strategies of Supersymmetric Particles at the LHC</h3>
            <h4>Detection of Supersymmetric Particles at the LHC</h4>
            <p>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is currently the most powerful particle accelerator in the world, with one of its main goals being the search for supersymmetric particles. The detection of supersymmetric particles at the LHC mainly relies on their production and decay processes in high-energy collisions. For example, by searching for final state particles (such as leptons, jets, and missing energy) that exceed the expectations of the Standard Model, one can indirectly detect the existence of supersymmetric particles.</p>
            <h4>Experimental Data Analysis and Evidence for Supersymmetry</h4>
            <p>Although the LHC has conducted high-energy collision experiments for many years, no clear evidence has yet been found to confirm the existence of supersymmetric particles. This has led researchers to continue exploring new breaking mechanisms and detection strategies, in hopes of verifying the theory of Supersymmetry in future experiments.</p>
