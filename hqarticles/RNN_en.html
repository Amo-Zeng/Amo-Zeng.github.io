            <h2>Introduction: The Intertextuality of Neural Networks and Human Thinking</h2>
            <p>In the development of artificial intelligence, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have opened a new chapter in deep learning with their unique sequence modeling capabilities. This technology has not only reshaped various application fields but, more importantly, has provided a new methodological perspective for understanding human cognition. This article explores the dual value of RNN in technological implementation and cognitive paradigm shifts through three dimensions: temporal extension, memory system reconstruction, and breakthroughs in artistic creation.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Chapter 1: Cognitive Reconstruction in Time Series – The Dimensional Extensibility of RNN</h3>
            <p>The core innovation of RNN lies in its hidden state mechanism, which enables the transfer of information across time steps. This feature allows RNN to break through the temporal and spatial limitations of traditional neural networks, demonstrating significant advantages in time series data modeling.</p>
            <p>From a technical implementation perspective, RNN achieves temporal extension through the following mechanisms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information Transfer:</strong> The hidden state serves as the information carrier, transferring key information between time steps.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Update:</strong> The network state is updated at each time step based on the current input and the previous hidden state.</li>
                <li><strong>Gradient Flow:</strong> Gradient propagation in the temporal dimension is achieved through the backpropagation algorithm.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To address the vanishing gradient problem in standard RNN for long sequence modeling, the following have been developed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks):</strong> Introduces memory cells and gating mechanisms (input gate, forget gate, output gate) for precise memory control.</li>
                <li><strong>GRU (Gated Recurrent Units):</strong> Employs a simplified gating structure to enhance computational efficiency while maintaining performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This temporal modeling capability is not only applicable to time series prediction but also holds significant value in social network analysis. RNN can effectively capture sequence dependencies in information propagation paths, providing a new technological paradigm for influence propagation prediction.</p>
