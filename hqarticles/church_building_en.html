            <h2>Multi-dimensional Exploration of Church Architecture</h2>
            <p>Church architecture, as a symbol of human civilization, carries not only religious beliefs, historical culture, and artistic achievements but also is a crystallization of human wisdom and creativity. In today's era, with the rapid development of digital technology and the severe challenges brought by global climate change, the study and transformation of church architecture have ushered in unprecedented new opportunities and challenges. This article will explore the multi-dimensional aspects and future development of church architecture from the perspectives of digital humanities, interdisciplinary research, and sustainability, revealing its multiple values and significance in modern society.</p>

            <h3>Digital Humanities Perspective: The "Dataization" of Church Architecture</h3>
            <p>Digital humanities, as an emerging interdisciplinary field, is reshaping our understanding and research of cultural phenomena in unprecedented ways. The "dataization" of church architecture is a concrete manifestation of this trend in the architectural field. Empowered by digital technology, church architecture is no longer just a static historical relic but has become an interactive and explorable dynamic data treasure trove, providing us with new research and experience methods.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Significance of Dataization:</strong> From Static Heritage to Dynamic Resource.</li>
                <li><strong>Methods of Dataization:</strong> The Combination of Technology and Innovation.</li>
                <li><strong>Future of Dataization:</strong> From Refinement to Cross-cultural Integration.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Interdisciplinary Perspective: Multi-dimensional Exploration of Art, Philosophy, and Sociology</h3>
            <p>Church architecture is not only a crystallization of technology but also a convergence point of art, philosophy, and sociology. Art grants it emotional and expressive power, philosophy provides its rational and critical foundation, and sociology reveals its process of embodiment in social practices. The introduction of an interdisciplinary perspective allows us to understand the multiple meanings of church architecture in a more comprehensive and in-depth way.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Art:</strong> The Bridge of Emotion and Expression.</li>
                <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> The Foundation of Rationality and Critique.</li>
                <li><strong>Sociology:</strong> The Lens of Structure and Interaction.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Sustainable Perspective: The "Greening" Transformation and Future Development of Church Architecture</h3>
            <p>In the context of the global climate crisis, the "greening" transformation of church architecture is not only a reflection on its physical form but also a profound questioning of the development path of human civilization. The "greening" of church architecture is not just a technical choice but also a cultural responsibility.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Concept of Greening:</strong> From Energy Saving and Emission Reduction to Cultural Responsibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Future of Greening:</strong> From Carbon Neutrality to Ecological Restoration.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The multi-dimensional exploration of church architecture not only opens a new window to history and culture for us but also provides profound insights for the future development of human civilization. Through the "dataization" of digital humanities, we can understand and appreciate the historical and artistic values of church architecture in a new way; through the interdisciplinary perspectives of art, philosophy, and sociology, we can more comprehensively understand the multiple functions and meanings of church architecture in society; through the sustainable "greening" transformation, we can allow church architecture to continue as a beacon of human civilization in the modern context, illuminating our path forward.</p>
