            <h2>Innovations in Microplastic Cleanup</h2>
            <h3>Background and Significance</h3>
            <p>Microplastics, due to their persistence and widespread distribution, have profound effects on marine ecosystems and human health. They are not only sources of environmental pollution but also enter the human body through the food chain, with potential health risks including endocrine disruption, immune system damage, etc. Thus, developing effective microplastic cleanup technologies is imperative.</p>
            <h3>Technological Breakthroughs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Filtration and Collection:</strong> New filtration systems, like vortex separators and electrostatic adsorption technology, combined with AI-driven real-time monitoring systems, can capture microplastics more efficiently. River interception nets and wastewater treatment plant filtration systems are key defenses.</li>
                <li><strong>Biodegradation:</strong> Gene-editing technologies enable specific strains and enzymes to rapidly decompose plastics, enhancing microbial degradation capabilities in the environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical and Chemical Treatments:</strong> Techniques such as photocatalytic degradation and pyrolysis convert plastics into useful resources like fuel, promoting resource recycling.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Cleanup Equipment:</strong> Projects like "The Ocean Cleanup" leverage natural forces and AI technology for large-scale ocean and river cleanup.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Future Prospects and Challenges</h3>
            <p><strong>Prospects:</strong> Continuous technological development and policy support will drive microplastic cleanup to become a routine environmental practice, lowering costs and raising public environmental awareness.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Technology dissemination, cost-effectiveness, environmental impact assessment, and the sustainability of recycling and reuse are hurdles to overcome.</p>

            <h2>Smart Waste Sorting System</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Global waste volumes continue to grow, and traditional waste management methods no longer meet the demands of modern society for environmental protection and resource recovery. Smart waste sorting systems enhance sorting efficiency and accuracy through technological means.</p>
            <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AI and Image Recognition:</strong> Deep learning models help in accurately identifying waste types, improving sorting accuracy.</li>
                <li><strong>Sensor Technology:</strong> Infrared, weight, and other sensors assist in recognizing the physical characteristics of waste.</li>
                <li><strong>Robotics:</strong> Robots perform preliminary sorting at waste treatment plants, reducing manual labor.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Analysis and Cloud Computing:</strong> Big data optimization of waste management processes, increasing resource utilization rates.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Prospects:</strong> Smart sorting systems will significantly enhance resource recovery efficiency, reduce environmental pollution, and increase public engagement.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Cost of technology dissemination, privacy protection, standardization, and public education remain areas of concern.</p>

            <h2>Interdisciplinary Research on Environmental Hygiene and Public Health</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Environmental pollution directly impacts human health, leading to the occurrence and spread of various diseases. Environmental factors are significant risk factors for many chronic diseases, with complex and extensive mechanisms of influence.</p>
            <h3>Research Methods</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Monitoring:</strong> Using IoT devices, remote sensing, and big data analysis for real-time pollutant concentration monitoring.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Health Monitoring:</strong> Through epidemiological studies and health geographic information systems (GIS), analyze the effects of environmental factors on health.</li>
                <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Collaboration:</strong> Joint research between environmental science and public health to explore specific mechanisms of pollution on human health and formulate scientific environmental policies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Prospects:</strong> Precise environmental monitoring and health management will promote the construction of healthy cities and foster global cooperation.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Data accuracy and availability, policy implementation and regulation, social equity, and technological and financial investments are crucial challenges to realize this vision.</p>
