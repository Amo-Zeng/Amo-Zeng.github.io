            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the field of signal processing, spectral estimation has always been a crucial research topic. It aims to infer the spectral characteristics of signals from limited sample data and is widely applied in communication, radar, medical imaging, and more. Traditional spectral estimation methods such as Fourier Transform (FT), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and Auto-Regressive (AR) models, although efficient in computation, often face significant limitations when dealing with high-dimensional data, complex noise environments, or non-stationary signals. In recent years, with the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning (DL), and quantum computing, these advanced technologies have begun to show great potential in the field of spectral estimation. This article will delve into the application of these new technologies in spectral estimation, analyze their advantages, challenges, and future prospects.</p>

            <h2>Limitations of Traditional Spectral Estimation Methods</h2>
            <p>Traditional spectral estimation methods primarily rely on Fourier Transform and its variants. Although they are efficient in computation, they often exhibit significant limitations when dealing with non-stationary signals, low signal-to-noise ratio environments, and complex multi-component signals. For example, the Periodogram method has an inherent trade-off between resolution and variance, while the Auto-Correlation method performs poorly in Gaussian noise environments. Additionally, these traditional methods typically require a large amount of prior knowledge or assumptions, which are often difficult to meet in practical applications.</p>
