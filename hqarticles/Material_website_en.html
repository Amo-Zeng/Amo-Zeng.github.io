            <h3>1. The "Invisible Traps" of Material Websites and a Guide to Avoiding Pitfalls</h3>
            <p>Behind the prosperity of digital content creation, material websites, while providing creators with convenient ways to obtain resources, hide numerous "invisible traps." From fee traps, copyright disputes to uneven material quality, a slight carelessness can fall into the "material trap."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fee Traps: The Deep Hole Behind Low Prices</strong>
                    <p>Many material websites attract users with the slogan of "free" or "low price," but these websites often charge users far more than expected through hidden fee methods. For example,层层叠加的会员订阅制、素材点数制的隐性消耗，以及各种隐藏费用，都可能让用户在不知不觉中承受高昂成本。</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Copyright Disputes: The Trap Behind Free Materials</strong>
                    <p>Free materials may hide copyright issues. Many users find out after downloading that these materials have copyright disputes, even facing legal lawsuits. Common copyright traps include misleading non-commercial labels, false authorization chains, and unclear usage rights.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Uneven Material Quality: Mixed Resource Libraries</strong>
                    <p>Many material websites claim to have "massive resources," but the actual material quality is hard to guarantee. Low resolution, high repetition rate, high processing materials not only affect the creation effect but may also make the work appear rough and low quality.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Guide to Avoiding "Material Traps"</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Skills to identify high-quality materials: Check the resolution, format, and details of the materials, avoid using over-filtered processed materials.</li>
                <li>Choosing the right material website: Prioritize well-reputed websites like Shutterstock, Unsplash, and read the licensing terms carefully.</li>
                <li>Strategies to avoid copyright disputes: Choose materials with CC0 license, use royalty-free material websites, and keep authorization proofs to ensure worry-free creation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Saying Goodbye to "Material Starvation": Three Strategies to Build an Exclusive Material Library</h3>
            <p>In the world of content creation, "material starvation" is a challenge every creator may face. Lack of appropriate materials not only affects the creation efficiency but may also lower the work quality. With the following three strategies, you can easily build your own exclusive material library.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Establishing a Clear Material Classification System</strong>
                    <p>A clear and reasonable classification system allows you to quickly find the required materials when needed. Classify by type (images, videos, 3D models), theme, format, and source, and add tags or keywords to significantly increase retrieval efficiency and reduce time waste.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mastering Simple Image Processing Skills</strong>
                    <p>By cropping, adjusting colors, splicing, and synthesizing, and adding text and graphics, you can create new visual effects by secondary processing of existing materials. Even simple processing can revitalize materials and enhance the expressiveness of the work.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sharing Materials with Others</strong>
                    <p>Sharing materials with team members, material sharing communities, or participating in material exchange activities can expand your material library and achieve resource complementation. This not only enriches your material choices but also enhances overall creation efficiency, making the creativity more diversified.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Importance of Material Libraries: Accelerators for Creation Efficiency</strong></p>
            <p>A well-organized material library not only provides creators with rich material resources but also significantly improves creation efficiency. Through classification and optimization, the material library helps creators quickly find the required materials, enhance work quality and creativity, making the creation more smooth and effortless.</p>
