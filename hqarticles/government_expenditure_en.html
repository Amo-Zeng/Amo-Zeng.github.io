            <h2>Government Expenditure Transformation in the Era of Digital Economy and Metaverse: The Dual Paths of Sustainability and Innovation</h2>
            <p>In the wave of globalization, digitalization, and sustainability transformation, the connotation and extension of government expenditure are undergoing profound changes. The traditional fiscal expenditure model based on physical goods is no longer adaptable to the multiple demands of digital economy, metaverse technology, and sustainable development. Government expenditure is no longer just a tool for economic regulation, but also a core means to promote social progress and environmental sustainability. This article will explore how government expenditure can achieve innovation and transformation at the intersection of emerging technologies and sustainable development from three dimensions: the "dematerialization" trend of the digital economy, the fiscal imagination of the metaverse, and the fiscal policy system for sustainability, thereby promoting the coordinated progress of economy, society, and environment.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>I. The "Dematerialization" Trend of Government Expenditure in the Digital Economy Era</h3>
            <p>The rapid rise of the digital economy is profoundly reshaping the global economic structure, with the traditional economy based on physical goods gradually giving way to a new economic form centered on data and information. In this context, the focus of government expenditure is also showing a significant "dematerialization" trend, gradually focusing on data infrastructure, platform economy regulation, digital tax collection, and bridging the digital divide.</p>
            <h4>1. Building Data Infrastructure: The Core Support of the Digital Economy</h4>
            <p>Data has become the core driving force of the digital economy, and the government needs to build data infrastructure that meets the needs of the digital economy through fiscal expenditure. This not only includes investment in physical networks and hardware, but more importantly, "dematerialized" support projects such as data sharing platforms, digital identity authentication systems, and data security protection mechanisms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Sharing Platforms</strong>: By constructing cross-department and cross-industry data sharing platforms, the government can break data silos, promote data interoperability, and enhance economic efficiency and governance capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Identity Authentication Systems</strong>: Promoting digital identity authentication systems can enhance the security and convenience of digital transactions, driving the widespread application of the digital economy.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Security Protection Mechanisms</strong>: Improving data security protection mechanisms ensures the sustainable circulation and utilization of data as a production factor, while preventing data leakage and misuse.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Platform Economy Regulation and Digital Tax Exploration: Balancing Development and Fairness</h4>
            <p>The rise of the platform economy has had a profound impact on the traditional market structure, and the government needs to adjust fiscal expenditure to promote the standardized development of the platform economy and maintain market fairness.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Antitrust Investigations</strong>: Allocating special funds for antitrust investigations ensures the fairness of market competition.</li>
