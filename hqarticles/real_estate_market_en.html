            <h2>From "Rent-to-Own Equal Rights" to "Residential Experience": Exploring New Residential Forms in the Post-Real Estate Era</h2>
            <p>As the Chinese real estate market matures, the traditional perspective of "housing price fluctuations" is no longer sufficient to comprehensively interpret market changes. In recent years, the introduction of the "Rent-to-Own Equal Rights" policy marks a redefinition of residential rights at the policy level. This transformation is not merely an adjustment in housing systems but also a profound shift in lifestyle.</p>

            <h3>I. "Rent-to-Own Equal Rights": Redefining Residential Rights</h3>
            <p>The introduction of the "Rent-to-Own Equal Rights" policy fundamentally represents a redesign of the housing system by the government. It aims to provide renters with equal rights as buyers, alleviating urban housing pressures, especially for young people. The implementation of this policy has had a profound impact on young urban residents and mobile populations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>More diverse living options for young people:</strong> Renters enjoy the same rights as buyers in areas like education and healthcare, reducing the reliance on homeownership.</li>
                <li><strong>More flexible urban population mobility:</strong> The rental market is gradually becoming more regulated, allowing renters to move freely between cities without worrying about rights restrictions due to household registration or property ownership.</li>
            </ul>
