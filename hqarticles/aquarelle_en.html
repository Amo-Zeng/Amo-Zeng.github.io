            <h3>Watercolor Painting and Psychological Healing: The Healing Power of Art</h3>
            <p>In the fast-paced modern life, stress, anxiety, and emotional distress have become common for many people. Watercolor painting, with its unique fluidity and unpredictability, has become an effective means of psychological healing.</p>
            <p>The creation process of watercolor painting is full of uncertainty, forcing the creator to let go of the pursuit of perfection and accept uncontrollable results. This process itself has a relaxing and emotional release effect. When people focus on creating watercolor paintings, their attention is drawn to the colors, shapes, and textures of the paper, temporarily forgetting the stress and anxiety of life.</p>
            <p>Through watercolor painting, people can express their inner feelings and thoughts, achieving self-healing. Psychological research shows that artistic creation can help people process and express complex emotions, especially those that are difficult to express in words. The rich colors and forms of watercolor painting can be used to express joy, sorrow, anger, and loneliness. Through this expression, people can better understand and accept their emotions, thereby reducing psychological burdens.</p>

            <h3>Watercolor Painting and Environmental Protection: The Green Power in Art</h3>
            <p>In the field of environmental protection, watercolor painting also plays an important role. Artists, through their watercolor works, not only showcase the beauty of nature but also reveal the seriousness of environmental issues. For example, artists can depict unpolluted mountains and lakes to showcase the harmony and beauty of nature, inspiring the audience's love and protection for nature. At the same time, they can also depict polluted rivers and deforested forests to visually demonstrate the severity of environmental problems, raising the audience's awareness of environmental protection.</p>
            <p>When creating watercolor paintings, artists can also reduce the negative impact on the environment by choosing eco-friendly materials. Using eco-friendly paints and recycled paper can reduce the consumption and pollution of natural resources. Eco-friendly paints are usually made from natural ingredients and do not contain harmful chemicals, making them more environmentally and health-friendly. Recycled paper is made from recycled waste paper, reducing the consumption of forest resources.</p>
            <p>The application of watercolor painting in environmental protection publicity activities is becoming more and more widespread. Through organizing environmental protection charity exhibitions and art workshops, artists can display their works to the public, convey environmental protection concepts, and raise the audience's awareness of environmental protection. These activities not only showcase the artists' talents but also convey environmental protection information through art, inspiring the audience's environmental protection actions.</p>
