### **6. Lack of Critical Perspective**
- **Problem**: The content focuses on solutions but does not address the limitations of current measures (e.g., regulatory loopholes in GDPR for large tech companies).
- **Improvement Suggestions**:
  - Include balanced viewpoints. For example:
    > "Although federated learning reduces privacy risks, it requires a large number of devices to participate in collaborative training, which may lead to higher energy consumption."

### **Summary: Improved Structure Example**
```markdown
1. **Introduction**  
   - AI as a double-edged sword: convenience vs. privacy risks  
   - Core conflict: data value vs. user rights (with case studies such as the health code system)

2. **Risk Analysis**  
   - Data Collection: Over-collection (e.g., facial recognition)  
   - Data Misuse: Algorithmic bias (e.g., hiring AI tools)

3. **Solutions**  
   - Technology: Federated learning, differential privacy (with technical principles and industry applications)  
   - Policy: GDPR (specific clauses) vs. China's Personal Information Protection Law

4. **Future Challenges**  
   - Disruption from new technologies (e.g., quantum computing breaking encryption)  
   - Regulatory challenges for multinational corporations
