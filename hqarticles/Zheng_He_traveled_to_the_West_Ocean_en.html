            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the early 15th century, the fleet of Zheng He under the Ming Dynasty of China, with its grand scale and superb navigation technology, reached a peak in world maritime history. Zheng He led seven expeditions, not only showcasing China's leading position in science and navigation technology but also profoundly influencing the development of navigation technology in later generations. This article delves into the construction techniques, navigation tools, and ship maintenance technologies of Zheng He's fleet, analyzing how these technologies were ahead of the world at the time and their impact on subsequent navigation technology. Additionally, this article will explore the cultural fusion and mutual learning of Zheng He's fleet in the early era of globalization, as well as its historical footprint on marine ecology.</p>

            <h3>The Splendor of Zheng He's Navigation Technology</h3>
            <h4>Fleet Construction Technology</h4>
            <p>The ships of Zheng He's fleet, especially the famous Treasure Ships, were among the largest and most advanced in the world at the time. The Treasure Ships could be over 100 meters long and tens of meters wide, with a displacement of over 10,000 tons. The construction techniques of these ships were extremely advanced, adopting modular construction methods, extensive use of mortise and tenon structures combined with iron nails, ensuring the robustness and durability of the ship's hull. Moreover, the design of the ships took into account the actual needs of navigation, such as the streamlined hull design, layered cabin structure, etc., reflecting the superb level of Chinese shipbuilding technology at the time.</p>
            <h4>Navigation Tools</h4>
            <p>Zheng He's fleet also demonstrated its advanced nature in navigation. The use of the compass (magnetic needle) allowed the fleet to determine directions in the vast ocean, which was a revolutionary technological advancement at the time. In addition, Zheng He's fleet used astrolabes to observe celestial phenomena, determining latitude by observing the positions of constellations, which was an extremely precise navigation technology at the time. The combined use of these navigation tools allowed Zheng He's fleet to safely traverse the open seas and reach distant regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
            <h4>Ship Maintenance Technology</h4>
            <p>To ensure the good condition of the ships during long voyages, Zheng He's fleet developed a comprehensive set of ship maintenance technologies. This included regular hull inspections, replacement of timber, waterproofing treatments of the hull, etc. The fleet also carried a large amount of spare materials and tools to conduct necessary repairs and maintenance during the voyage. The application of these maintenance technologies ensured the continuous navigation capability and safety of the ships.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Fusion and Mutual Learning in the Early Era of Globalization</h3>
            <h4>The Spread of Chinese Culture</h4>
            <p>The cultural dissemination of Zheng He's fleet covered multiple aspects, including language, art, religion, and scientific knowledge. In terms of language, although Mandarin did not take root widely locally, the written language of Chinese civilization had a certain impact on the local elite through translation and document exchange. In terms of art, the rich goods and crafts brought by Zheng He's fleet, such as porcelain, silk, lacquerware, enriched the local market and inspired local artisans' artistic creations. In terms of religion, the members of Zheng He's fleet included Buddhists, Taoists, etc., who conducted religious rituals and preaching in the visited areas, spreading Chinese religious culture. In terms of scientific knowledge, the navigation technology and astronomical calendar of Zheng He's fleet had a profound impact on the local areas.</p>
            <h4>Absorption and Integration of Local Culture</h4>
            <p>While disseminating Chinese culture, Zheng He's fleet also actively absorbed and integrated local customs and culture. This two-way cultural exchange not only enriched the connotations of Chinese civilization but also promoted mutual understanding and respect among different cultures. In terms of customs, the members of Zheng He's fleet, living and working in the visited areas for a long time, inevitably influenced by local customs and habits. In terms of art, Zheng He's fleet absorbed a large number of local artistic elements. In terms of religion, Zheng He's fleet also came into contact with various religious beliefs through interaction with local residents. In terms of scientific knowledge, Zheng He's fleet also absorbed local navigation technology and astronomical knowledge during the voyage.</p>

            <h3>Environmental Footprint in Historical Navigation</h3>
            <h4>Fishing Activities</h4>
            <p>The large number of people and supplies carried by the fleet meant a need for a substantial amount of food, making fishing activities inevitable. This could lead to overfishing in certain areas, affecting the local fishery ecology.</p>
            <h4>Ship Emissions</h4>
            <p>The maintenance of ancient wooden ships required a lot of wood, and logging activities could damage coastal forests, affecting the marine ecosystem. In addition, the waste water and garbage emissions from ships could also pollute the marine environment.</p>
            <h4>Biological Invasion</h4>
            <p>Zheng He's fleet might have carried some non-native species, which could become invasive species in new environments, affecting the local ecological balance.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Zheng He's navigation technology was at the leading level of the world at the time, and its construction techniques, navigation tools, and ship maintenance technologies all reflected China's outstanding achievements in the field of science at the time. The application of these technologies not only propelled China's Maritime Silk Road in its time but also had a profound impact on the development of navigation technology in later generations. At the same time, the cultural exchange practices of Zheng He's fleet not only demonstrated the characteristics and mechanisms of cultural mutual learning in the early era of globalization but also had a profound impact on later global trends. Furthermore, Zheng He's historical navigation reminds us that the impact of human activities on marine ecology cannot be ignored. Through modern environmental science research methods, we can better understand these impacts and provide important historical references for today's marine protection and sustainable development. Zheng He's maritime feats are still regarded as a monument in human maritime history, and his technological achievements and spirit of navigation deserve our in-depth study and inheritance.</p>
