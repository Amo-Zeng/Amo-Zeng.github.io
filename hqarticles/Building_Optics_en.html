            <h2>Architectural Optics and Sustainability: A Deep Dive into Optical Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>In the context of global climate change and resource scarcity, the construction industry, as one of the major sources of energy consumption and carbon emissions, faces significant challenges. The concept of sustainable development requires architectural design not only to meet functional needs but also to minimize environmental impact. Architectural optics, as an important branch of architectural design, provides new ideas and methods for achieving energy-efficient and emission-reducing buildings by making rational use of natural light and optimizing the light environment. This article will explore how technologies such as light pipes and smart glass, as well as building facade design, can be used to achieve
