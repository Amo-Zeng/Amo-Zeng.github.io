            <h2>Religious Rituals: A Complex Compound of Cultural Memory, Social Power, and Psychological Healing</h2>
            <p>Religious rituals, as one of the oldest cultural practices in human society, transcend mere expressions of faith. They are a sophisticated social technology, serving as a vehicle for cultural memory, a tool for the reproduction of social power, and a therapeutic domain for personal mental health. Through an in-depth analysis of the multifaceted functions of religious rituals in cultural heritage, social control, and personal psychological reconstruction, we can uncover their profound impact on human society and understand their transformation and continuity in modern times.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Memory Carrier: Recapitulation of History and Intergenerational Transmission</h3>
            <p>Religious rituals are first and foremost carriers of cultural memory. By recreating historical events, transmitting cultural symbols, and facilitating intergenerational cultural inheritance, they help specific social groups preserve and pass on their history, values, and collective memory. This transmission of memory is not only a retrospective look at the past but also a reinterpretation and understanding of history. For example, the Jewish Passover, through specific ritual actions such as eating unleavened bread and bitter herbs, reenacts the historical event of Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt, reinforcing the Jewish understanding of freedom and suffering. Similarly, the Christian Easter, through church services and dramatic performances, allows believers to relive the history of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection, strengthening group solidarity and identity.</p>

            <h3>Reproduction of Social Power: Sanctification and Construction of Symbolic Systems</h3>
            <p>Religious rituals are not only carriers of cultural memory but also tools for the reproduction of social power. As a "soul technology," religious rituals engage in the construction and reproduction of social power through carefully encoded symbolic systems. Collective chanting, ritual dances, and prayer gestures in ceremonies repeatedly inscribe specific worldviews and values into the collective memory of participants, making them a socially consensual framework that requires no reflection. This consensus is formed not only through one-way indoctrination but also through the reinforcement of sensory experiences, naturalizing binary oppositions such as the sacred and the profane, the individual and the collective, and morality and law into a habitual way of thinking.</p>

            <h3>Therapeutic Domain for Mental Health: Reconstruction of the Psyche and Healing of Trauma</h3>
            <p>In the fast-paced modern society, religious rituals exhibit their unique psychological healing power. As an ancient practice of psychological reconstruction, religious rituals create a specific psychological field through meticulous structural design, enabling deep regulation and reconstruction of the individual's mental state within this field.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Multiple Meanings and Modern Transformation of Religious Rituals</h3>
            <p>Religious rituals, as a compound social technology, serve as carriers of cultural memory, tools for the reproduction of social power, and therapeutic domains for personal mental health. They maintain cultural identity through the recapitulation of history, the transmission of cultural symbols, and intergenerational inheritance; they participate in the reproduction of social power through sanctification and the construction of symbolic systems; and they provide possibilities for psychological reconstruction for individuals through physical presence, emotional arousal, collective coexistence, and the creation of sacred spaces.</p>
