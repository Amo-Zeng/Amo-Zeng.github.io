            <h2>The Alienation and Reconstruction of Street Art</h2>
            <p>Street art, once regarded as urban "graffiti," is undergoing a profound transformation amid the wave of digital technology. This transformation not only changes the forms of artistic expression but also redefines the relationship between art and the city, as well as art and society, propelling it from the margins to the center and from passive to active, becoming an integral part of the urban fabric in the digital age.</p>

            <h3>The Visual Reconstruction of Urban Memory</h3>
            <p>Street art is no longer simply a decorative element in the city; it is a visual chronicle of urban memory. Through color and line, it weaves together the temporal and spatial dimensions of the city, constructing a multi-layered network of urban memory.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Social Media Platforms:</strong> Platforms like Instagram and TikTok enable art to instantly reach a global audience.</li>
                <li><strong>Augmented Reality (AR) Technology:</strong> Audiences interact with the art through mobile apps, creating immersive experiences.</li>

            <h3>The Dual Identity of Street Art</h3>
            <p>In the future, street art will continue to play a dual role as both a guardian of urban memory and a catalyst for social change.</p>
