            <h2>Mobility and Social Change of Street Art</h2>
            <p>In contemporary society, street art, with its unique mobility, diversity, and spontaneous interactivity, is emerging as a significant force redefining urban spaces and challenging traditional art notions. This art form not only wanders through physical spaces but also deeply integrates with social media under the wave of the digital age, unleashing unprecedented energy. Street art is not merely a visual expression of urban culture; it is also a "palette" of social change, profoundly influencing the urban cultural landscape and social structure through visual protests, social critiques, and cultural manifestos.</p>

            <h3>Challenges of Mobility and Ownership</h3>
            <p>The mobility of street art first challenges the traditional concept of art ownership. In the traditional art system, the ownership of artworks is often closely related to collectors, galleries, and museums, which control the dissemination and meaning generation of artworks through management and display. However, the emergence of street art breaks this monopoly. Street artists' works are usually temporary and transient, appearing in any corner of the city, such as walls, subway stations, and abandoned buildings. This uncertainty makes street art difficult to be bound by the traditional ownership framework.</p>
            <p>The mobility of street art is also reflected in the flexibility and uncertainty of its creative process. Artists often use improvisation, taking various natural or artificial urban environments as canvases to create unique works. These works are not only fluid in space but also transient in time. They may disappear due to urban reconstruction, natural erosion, or human destruction, prompting viewers to think about the sustainability of artworks. This irreplaceability and temporality make street art a more open, decentralized art form, further challenging traditional art ownership concepts.</p>

            <h3>Symbiotic Relationship in the Digital Age</h3>
            <p>The advent of the digital age has deeply integrated street art with social media, unleashing unprecedented energy. Social media platforms serve as a huge stage, pushing street art from the periphery to the spotlight. Artists no longer rely on chance passers-by to spread their works but can achieve viral dissemination and reach a global audience by posting pictures, videos, or even live-streaming the creative process. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter provide street artists with spaces to showcase themselves, gain inspiration, and interact with fans, allowing them to receive feedback and adjust their creative direction in real-time.</p>
            <p>Advances in digital technology inject new vitality into street art. Technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) break the two-dimensional plane limitations of traditional painting, bringing street art into three-dimensional and even four-dimensional spaces. Artists can use these technologies to create more immersive and interactive works, such as AR graffiti that interacts with the audience and 3D stereoscopic paintings that can be viewed through mobile phones. The popularization of digital painting software and projection technology also provides street artists with more creative tools, greatly improving their efficiency and the quality of their works.</p>

            <h3>Visual Protest and Social Critique</h3>
            <p>Street art, as a form of "visual protest," plays an indispensable role in social movements due to its directness and mass appeal. Traditional political propaganda often relies on texts and statistics, which, although important, often lack emotional depth and visual impact. In contrast, street art, through the combination of images, symbols, and colors, can quickly capture the attention of passers-by and evoke their emotional resonance. For example, a mural depicting the helpless eyes of war victims can resonate deeply with the public's anti-war sentiments more than any text. Street artists skillfully use this visual language to concretize abstract social issues, making them more tangible and prompting public discussions on these topics.</p>
            <p>Artists use street art to express deep critiques of social injustices and inequalities. In many cities, issues such as wealth disparity, racial discrimination, and gender inequality still exist, and street art presents these issues visually. By depicting the living conditions of marginalized groups, street artists expose the darker sides of society, prompting the public to confront these issues. For example, graffiti in American cities often reveals police brutality and racial discrimination, while murals in European streets often express concern for immigration issues. These artworks are not only critical of the current situation but also calls for social justice, inspiring people to take action and promote social change.</p>

            <h3>Power and Expression Game</h3>
            <p>Political power's view of street art is often complex. On one hand, street art, as a form of public expression, can stimulate public participation and responsibility, thus challenging the existing political order. On the other hand, political power often regards street art as an "illegal" expression because it frequently appears in public spaces without authorization, challenging the legitimacy of power and the boundaries of management. Therefore, street artists often face censorship and suppression from authorities. However, it is this confrontational relationship that gives street art its unique power. By resisting authority's censorship, artists not only defend their right to express but also challenge the legitimacy of power to some extent. For example, in some countries, street art becomes part of democratic movements, with artists creating murals and graffiti to express dissatisfaction and protest against the government.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Street art, with its mobility, diversity, and participatory nature, profoundly affects the urban cultural landscape and social structure. It challenges traditional art ownership concepts, redefines public spaces, and engages in dialogue with mainstream culture using "guerrilla tactics," becoming a significant force in redefining urban spaces. As urbanization accelerates and society becomes increasingly diverse, street art will continue to evolve, bringing more creativity and vitality to the city. Under the impetus of the digital age, the deep integration of street art with social media significantly enhances its dissemination speed and influence, becoming a "palette" of social change. Through visual protests and social critiques, it promotes cultural dialogue and social progress.</p>
