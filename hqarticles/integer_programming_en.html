            <h3>Practical Applications of Integer Programming</h3>
            <p>The applications of integer programming go far beyond this. In more complex system optimizations, it demonstrates formidable power. For instance, in supply chain management, where goods allocation must consider multiple factors such as logistics costs, inventory limits, and production capacity, integer programming helps businesses find the optimal allocation plan under these constraints.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supply Chain Management:</strong> Optimize goods allocation, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Traffic Scheduling:</strong> Optimize bus routes, reduce congestion, and enhance urban traffic flow.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Investment:</strong> Find the best balance between risk and return, constructing optimal investment portfolios.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Intelligent Evolution of Integer Programming: From Traditional Algorithms to Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>With the expansion of problem scale and increased computational demands, traditional algorithms often face challenges of high computational complexity and lengthy solution times when dealing with large-scale integer programming. Against this backdrop, the rapid development of machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies has brought new hope to the field of integer programming, driving its intelligent evolution.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> Predict branch directions, reducing unnecessary computation paths.</li>
                <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Optimize solving strategies, improving solving efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Big Data Analysis:</strong> Automatically discover and utilize potential patterns in the problem.</li>
            </ol>
