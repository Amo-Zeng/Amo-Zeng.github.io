            <h2>Merging Quantum Communication with Traditional Cryptography: A New Security Paradigm Centered on the B92 Protocol</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>In the realm of modern information security, the rapid development of communication technology not only brings convenience but also triggers new security challenges. With the rise of quantum computing, traditional cryptographic methods (like RSA, ECC, etc.) face the risk of being cracked. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) as a method of encryption based on quantum mechanics offers theoretically absolute security. The B92 protocol, as an implementation of QKD, has become a focal point of research due to its simplicity and applicability. This article discusses the enhancement of security in quantum communication with the B92 protocol, and its integration with IoT and traditional cryptography, proposing a new security communication paradigm.</p>

            <h3>Enhancing Security of the B92 Protocol</h3>
            <p>The B92 protocol utilizes the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics by sending non-orthogonal quantum states for key distribution. However, relying solely on this method might be insufficient against evolving attack strategies. Thus, enhancing the security of the B92 protocol is crucial:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application of Quantum Entanglement:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Increasing Entanglement Levels:</strong> By introducing multi-particle entangled states like GHZ or W states, the complexity and uncertainty of communication can be increased, making it harder for attackers to gain useful information. Additionally, entanglement purification techniques can reduce environmental noise effects on quantum states, improving key fidelity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Entanglement Swapping and Quantum Repeaters:</strong> Through quantum repeaters, the B92 protocol can extend communication distances, reduce bit error rates, and ensure the security of quantum keys over long distances.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Utilization of Quantum Teleportation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No Information Leakage:</strong> With teleportation, information is directly transmitted at the quantum level, reducing the risk of leakage through classical channels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Error Correction and Privacy Amplification:</strong> Combining quantum error correction codes and privacy amplification techniques can further enhance the security of the B92 protocol, ensuring that even if some information leaks, the complete key cannot be reconstructed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Exploring New Quantum States:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Topological Quantum States and Higher-Dimensional Quantum States:</strong> Exploring and applying topological quantum computing and higher-dimensional quantum states can enhance noise resistance and information capacity, thereby improving the interference resistance and security of the B92 protocol.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
