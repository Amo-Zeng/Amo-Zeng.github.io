            <h2>The Forgotten "Leave" Button: On the Alienation of Individual Boundaries in the Age of Technology</h2>
            <p>In this digital age, our lives seamlessly switch between the virtual and the real. On social media, we are both spectators and performers, sharing snippets of our lives, participating in interactive discussions, and even engaging in heated debates in the comment sections. However, behind this digital carnival, a small yet significant detail is gradually being overlookedâ€”the absence of the "Leave" button.</p>

            <h3>The Disappearance of the "Leave" Button: The Digital Cage of Tech Giants</h3>
            <p>The "Leave" button, once ubiquitous in the early days of the internet, has quietly disappeared from most platforms. This subtle change in design not only reflects the impact of technological evolution but also mirrors the carefully constructed digital cage by tech giants.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Erosion of Individual Autonomy:</strong> The disappearance of the "Leave" button symbolizes the erosion of individual autonomy in digital spaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Precise Control of User Behavior:</strong> Leaving becomes a choice that requires extra effort, while staying becomes the default state.</li>
                <li><strong>The Dissolution of Personal Boundaries:</strong> Personal boundaries in digital spaces are gradually eroded, and private time is continually encroached upon.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Avatars and the Self: The Crisis of Identity in the Digital Mask</h3>
            <p>In the digital age, the internet is like a kaleidoscope, slicing the real world into fragments and reassembling them into countless parallel universes. In this virtual world, each of us has an avatar, a digital self.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Duality of the Digital Mask:</strong> Avatars provide us with the freedom to express ourselves but also become a mental shackle.</li>
                <li><strong>The Crisis of Identity:</strong> The blurring of the line between the virtual and the real leads to confusion and loss of identity.</li>
                <li><strong>Seeking the True Self:</strong> Finding the true self in the virtual world and facing the virtual and the real with sincerity.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Social Islands: How Virtual Social Interactions Exacerbate Real-Life Social Barriers</h3>
            <p>The wave of technology has swept across the globe, and virtual social platforms have emerged like mushrooms after the rain, breaking down geographical and temporal barriers and allowing people to easily establish connections. However, behind this seemingly prosperous scene, a hidden yet profound impact is intensifying: virtual social interactions are creating invisible "social islands."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The "Sugar-Coated Bullets" of Virtual Social Interactions:</strong> Virtual social interactions satisfy people's desire for communication and recognition but also lead to addiction.</li>
                <li><strong>The "Desertification" of Social Skills:</strong> Over-reliance on virtual social interactions leads to the degradation of real-life social skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Rebuilding Bridges for Real-Life Social Interactions:</strong> Using virtual social interactions reasonably and actively embracing real-life social interactions can truly break down "social islands."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Facing the alienation of individual boundaries in the age of technology, we need to rethink the value of humanity in the digital era. Technology should serve humanity, not dominate individual consciousness. Only by reclaiming the freedom to "Leave" can we truly take control in the digital age and protect our spiritual homeland.</p>
