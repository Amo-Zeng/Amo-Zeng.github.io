            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Drug development is a complex and time-consuming process. Traditional drug screening methods rely on experimental experience and limited data analysis, often being inefficient and costly. With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and the deepening understanding of the interactions between human health, environment, and microbiology, drug screening is undergoing a revolution from "experience-driven" to "data-driven." This article explores how AI integrates environmental factors, microbiome data, and massive biological information to drive drug screening towards a future of precision, efficiency, and personalization.</p>

            <h3>1. Environmental Factors and Drug Screening: Building a Comprehensive Drug Evaluation System</h3>
            <p>The metabolism and mechanism of action of drugs in the human body do not occur in isolation but are influenced by various environmental factors. These factors include diet, lifestyle, environmental pollutants, etc., which profoundly affect the efficacy and safety of drugs by regulating the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes, influencing drug-target interactions, and increasing the risk of adverse drug reactions.</p>
            <h4>1.1 Impact of Environmental Factors on Drug Metabolism</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dietary Factors</strong>: High-fat, high-sugar diets can induce the expression of the CYP3A4 enzyme, accelerating the metabolism of certain drugs and reducing their blood concentration and efficacy. Diets rich in flavonoid compounds may inhibit the activity of the CYP2C9 enzyme, delaying drug metabolism and increasing the risk of drug toxicity.</li>
                <li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: Smoking induces the activity of the CYP1A2 enzyme, accelerating the metabolism of drugs like caffeine and theophylline, shortening their duration of action. Alcohol inhibits the activity of the CYP2E1 enzyme, delaying the metabolism of drugs like acetaminophen and increasing the risk of liver toxicity.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Pollutants</strong>: Heavy metals, pesticides, industrial chemicals, and other environmental pollutants can also affect the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes, disrupting the normal drug metabolism process and leading to altered drug efficacy or toxic side effects.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.2 Impact of Environmental Factors on Drug-Target Interactions</h4>
            <p>Environmental factors also influence the binding ability of drugs to their targets:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature and pH</strong>: Different drugs exhibit varying solubility, stability, and binding ability to their targets under different temperature and pH conditions, thus affecting drug efficacy.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>2. Microbiome and Drug Screening: A New Perspective on Personalized Medicine</h3>
            <p>The human microbiome, especially the gut microbiome, plays a crucial role in drug metabolism and efficacy. AI can integrate microbiome data to predict individual drug responses, thereby enabling personalized drug screening.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>By integrating environmental factors and microbiome data, AI is driving drug screening towards a future of precision, efficiency, and personalization. This not only accelerates drug development but also enhances drug efficacy and safety, offering new possibilities for precision medicine.</p>
