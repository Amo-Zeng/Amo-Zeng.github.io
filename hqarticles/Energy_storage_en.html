Here is the English translation of your web content:

The term "Math A" (数甲) you mentioned usually refers to the following possibilities, which I have summarized for you:

### 1. **China's Gaokao Math (Regional Classification)**  
   The **Gaokao math papers in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and other regions** were once divided into "Math A" (数甲) and "Math B" (数乙):  
   - **Math A (Science Track Paper)**: Designed for science/engineering students, covering functions, sequences, basic calculus, probability & statistics, analytic geometry, complex numbers, etc., with higher difficulty.  
   - **Math B (Humanities Track Paper)**: For liberal arts students, with a narrower scope (e.g., no calculus) and lower difficulty.  
   *Note: Recent Gaokao reforms have merged science/humanities papers in most provinces, eliminating the explicit "Math A/B" distinction.*  

### 2. **Taiwan High School Math Curriculum**  
   In **Taiwan's high school courses**, math is stratified by difficulty:  
   - **Math A (数甲)**: For the natural sciences track (STEM-oriented), covering advanced topics like calculus, series, vector algebra, and spatial geometry.  
   - **Math B (数乙)**: For the social sciences track (liberal arts), focusing on statistics, probability, and basic algebra.  
   *Example textbooks*: Titles like *Math A* by Nanyi Books or Hanlin Publishing are commonly used for senior-year electives.  

### 3. **Japanese University Entrance Exam Classification**  
   In Japan's "Center Test" or "Common Test," math is categorized as:  
   - **Math I, A** (Basic)  
   - **Math II, B** (Intermediate)  
   - **Math III** (Highest difficulty, including calculus and complex functions), sometimes colloquially referred to as "Math A" in certain regions.

### Reference Suggestions:  
- **For Gaokao Math**: Students in Shanghai/Zhejiang may review "Science Track Papers" or "Math I Papers" from past years (e.g., pre-2023).  
- **For Taiwan Curriculum**: Search for textbooks like *High School Math A* or the scope of the College Scholastic Ability Test (學測).  
- **For Japanese Exams**: Use the Japanese keyword `数学Ⅲ` (Math III).  

If you can provide more context (e.g., your location or specific purpose), I can offer more precise guidance!

**Key Adjustments**:  
- Localized terms like "Gaokao" and "学测" are retained with explanations.  
- "数甲/数乙" translated as "Math A/B" for clarity, with original terms in parentheses.  
- Added colloquial notes for Japanese "Math III" usage.  
- Structured headings for better readability.
