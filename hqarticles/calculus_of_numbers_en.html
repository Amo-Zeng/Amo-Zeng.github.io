            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Computational number theory, a mathematical field focusing on the properties of integers and their applications in computation, has increasingly become a core tool in various cutting-edge scientific fields. Although number theory may seem abstract and detached from practical applications, its theories and methods have profound impacts in areas such as cryptography, machine learning, quantum computing, and bioinformatics. This article delves into the cross-disciplinary applications of computational number theory, highlighting its unique advantages in solving complex scientific and engineering problems, and explores potential future directions in this field.</p>

            <h2>Number Theory and Machine Learning: From Prime Distribution to Neural Network Optimization</h2>
            <h3>Deep Integration of Prime Distribution and Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>Prime distribution is a classic problem in number theory, while machine learning excels in handling complex data and pattern recognition. Recently, researchers have begun to combine these two fields to explore new research paths. For example, by using neural networks to approximate the prime-counting function \( \pi(x) \), researchers not only capture subtle features of prime distribution but also uncover previously undiscovered mathematical laws. This integration not only provides new tools for number theory research but also offers new inspiration for the design of machine learning algorithms.</p>
            <h3>Riemann Hypothesis and Deep Learning Collide</h3>
            <p>The Riemann Hypothesis, one of the most challenging unsolved problems in number theory, revolves around the distribution of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Using deep learning models, researchers can search for these zeros on the complex plane. This method not only verifies known zero locations but also potentially discovers new ones, opening up new perspectives for the study of the Riemann Hypothesis. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the powerful synergy between theoretical mathematics and modern computational techniques.</p>
            <h3>Machine Learning Applications in Cryptography</h3>
            <p>In cryptography, machine learning can be used to assess the security of existing encryption algorithms and design more efficient and secure encryption schemes. For instance, by training neural network models to simulate attacker behavior, researchers can evaluate the security of the RSA encryption algorithm. Additionally, machine learning can optimize the efficiency of encryption algorithms, ensuring high security even in resource-constrained environments. This interdisciplinary application provides new possibilities for the future development of cryptography.</p>

            <h2>Computational Number Theory and Quantum Computing: Unlocking New Generations of Cryptography</h2>
            <h3>Quantum Computing's Challenge to Traditional Cryptography</h3>
            <p>With the rapid advancement of quantum computing technology, traditional cryptography systems based on the difficulty of integer factorization, such as the RSA algorithm, face unprecedented challenges. Quantum computers using Shor's algorithm can solve integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems in polynomial time, threatening the security of existing cryptographic systems. Faced with this challenge, researchers must rethink the fundamental theories and design principles of cryptography.</p>
            <h3>Exploration of Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Algorithms</h3>
            <p>To counter the threat of quantum computing, researchers are exploring cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems that quantum computers cannot solve efficiently. For example, lattice-based cryptographic algorithms (such as Learning With Errors) and code-based cryptographic algorithms (such as McEliece algorithm) use the difficulty of solving the shortest vector problem in lattices to provide security against quantum computing attacks. These new cryptographic algorithms not only ensure future network security but also promote further application of number theory in cryptography.</p>
            <h3>Innovation in Quantum Secure Communication Protocols</h3>
            <p>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols use the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, such as quantum superposition and entanglement, to ensure secure information transmission. By leveraging the non-cloning property of quantum states and the interference of quantum measurements, QKD can theoretically achieve unconditional security. Even in the presence of quantum computers, QKD ensures the confidentiality of communication. This quantum-based communication protocol offers a new solution for future secure communication.</p>
