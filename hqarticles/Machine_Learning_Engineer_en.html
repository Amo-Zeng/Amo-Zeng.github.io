            <h3>Integration and Application of Interdisciplinary Knowledge</h3>
            <p>Modern engineers are no longer just experts in a single technology stack; they need to have a broad knowledge base and comprehensive skills. Especially in the field of medical AI, engineers need to master machine learning algorithms as well as understand professional knowledge in biology, medical imaging, etc.</p>
            <h4>Challenges:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Breadth and Depth of Knowledge:</strong> Engineers need to balance the depth and breadth of knowledge in multiple fields within a limited time.</li>
                <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Communication and Collaboration:</strong> Experts from different fields have their own professional jargon and methodologies, and engineers need to communicate effectively using different languages.</li>
                <li><strong>Combination of Technology and Application:</strong> The application of technology must consider various constraints and demands of real-world scenarios like cost, convenience, privacy protection, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Career Development:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diverse Career Paths:</strong> Engineers can become architects of AI solutions for healthcare by integrating interdisciplinary knowledge, designing and developing AI systems for diagnostics, treatment, and prevention.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Problem-Solving Skills:</strong> Mastery of multiple disciplines can significantly enhance an engineer's ability to solve complex problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Pioneering New Fields:</strong> Engineers can become pioneers and leaders in emerging fields like precision medicine and digital health.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Learning and Growth:</strong> Engineers need to maintain a continuous learning attitude to keep up with the latest industry developments and technological updates.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Ethics and Societal Impact of Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>As machine learning technology becomes ubiquitous, engineers must face and resolve a series of ethical issues:</p>
            <h4>Ethics and Societal Impact:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bias and Discrimination:</strong> Engineers must ensure that machine learning models do not inherit or amplify biases within the data, using fairness constraints and fairness-aware models.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy Infringement:</strong> Protect user privacy through techniques like differential privacy and data anonymization while adhering to data protection regulations.</li>
                <li><strong>Unfair Outcomes:</strong> Ensure the interpretability and transparency of models to prevent algorithms from producing unfair results, promoting social justice.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Career Opportunities:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Policy Makers:</strong> Engineers can participate in or drive the formulation of AI ethics regulations to ensure that technological development aligns with societal ethics.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Consultants:</strong> Provide ethical advice at various stages of product development, enhancing market acceptance and corporate social responsibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Industry Standards Setters:</strong> By joining or leading industry organizations, push for the establishment of stricter, fairer technical standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Education and Training:</strong> Disseminate ethical knowledge, cultivate ethical awareness among the next generation of technologists, and elevate the industry's overall ethical level.</li>
            </ul>
