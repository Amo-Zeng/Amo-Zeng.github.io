            <h3>Virtual Reality: Immersive Experience Redefining History</h3>
            <p>In the digital age, traditional museum display methods can no longer fully meet the public's need for immersive historical experiences. The rise of virtual reality technology brings unprecedented opportunities to museums. VR technology acts as a "magic key," breaking the boundaries of time and space, bringing history back to life, and offering the public more vivid, three-dimensional, and interactive historical experiences.</p>

                <li><strong>Historical Scene Reconstruction:</strong> Through VR technology, museums can digitally reconstruct historical scenes and artifacts, allowing visitors to experience history as if they were traveling through time.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Dissemination:</strong> VR technology also expands the dissemination channels of museums, with digital exhibition content and internet platforms enabling cultural resources to reach audiences worldwide.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Instant Interaction:</strong> Social media provides museums with the opportunity to break physical space limitations, allowing them to establish instant and interactive connections with global audiences.</li>
