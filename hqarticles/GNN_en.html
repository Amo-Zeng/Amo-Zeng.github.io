            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have emerged as a powerful deep learning tool, initially achieving significant success in structured data domains such as social networks and knowledge graphs. However, with deeper research, the application scope of GNNs has gradually expanded to non-traditional fields, such as images, text, and time series data in unstructured data domains. At the same time, the deep integration of GNNs with Knowledge Graphs (KG) provides a new technological path for building intelligent knowledge engines. This article will explore the applications of GNNs in non-traditional fields, analyze their data transformation methods, model architecture designs, and performance, and compare them with traditional methods. Additionally, this article will delve into the fusion methods of GNNs and knowledge graphs and their value in practical applications, finally looking forward to future development directions.</p>

            <h2>Applications of GNN in Non-Traditional Fields</h2>
            <h3>Image Segmentation</h3>
            <p><strong>Application Scenario:</strong> Image segmentation is a core task in computer vision, aiming to divide an image into multiple regions with semantic meaning. Traditional methods rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), but CNN has limitations in processing global context information.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Transformation Method:</strong> GNNs transform images into graph structures, treating each pixel as a node in the graph, with edges between nodes representing spatial relationships or similarities between pixels. GNNs can capture global dependencies among pixels in the image.</p>
            <p><strong>Model Architecture Design:</strong> GNNs are often used in conjunction with CNNs, where CNN extracts local features, and GNNs capture global context information through graph structures to optimize segmentation results. Common model architectures include GCN modules in the DeepLab series.</p>
            <p><strong>Performance:</strong> GNNs significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of image segmentation, especially when dealing with complex backgrounds and large areas of similar regions.</p>
            <h3>Relation Extraction in Natural Language Processing</h3>
            <p><strong>Application Scenario:</strong> Relation extraction is an important task in natural language processing, aiming to identify relationships between entities from text. Traditional methods perform poorly in handling long-distance dependencies.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Transformation Method:</strong> Text is transformed into graph structures, with each word or entity treated as a node, and edges between nodes representing semantic relationships or associations. GNNs capture long-distance dependencies in text.</p>
            <p><strong>Model Architecture Design:</strong> GNNs are combined with pre-trained language models (such as BERT), extracting semantic features first, and then GNNs capture relationships between entities through graph structures. Common model architectures include relation extraction models based on Graph Attention Networks (GAT).</p>
            <p><strong>Performance:</strong> GNNs significantly improve the accuracy of relation extraction, especially when dealing with long texts and complex relationships.</p>
            <h3>Financial Market Prediction</h3>
            <p><strong>Application Scenario:</strong> Financial market prediction is a typical time series prediction task, aiming to predict future stock prices or market trends. Traditional methods have limitations in handling complex market dynamics.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Transformation Method:</strong> GNNs transform time series data into graph structures, treating data for each time step as a node, with edges between nodes representing dependencies or associations between market factors. GNNs capture the global dynamics of the market.</p>
            <p><strong>Model Architecture Design:</strong> GNNs are combined with time series models (such as LSTM), extracting time features first, and then GNNs capture market dynamics through graph structures. Common model architectures include time series prediction models based on GCN.</p>
            <p><strong>Performance:</strong> GNNs significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of financial market prediction, especially when dealing with complex market dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Deep Integration of GNN with Knowledge Graphs</h2>
            <h3>Representation Learning of Knowledge Graphs</h3>
            <p>Representation learning of knowledge graphs is a key step in the fusion of GNNs and KGs. Traditional methods (such as TransE, ComplEx) rely on vector space models and have limitations in handling complex relationships and large-scale graph structures. GNNs capture complex relationships between entities through information propagation and feature aggregation, generating more expressive entity representations, preserving local structural information, and capturing high-order relational patterns.</p>
            <h3>Reasoning and Completion of Knowledge Graphs</h3>
            <p>Reasoning and completion of knowledge graphs are important application scenarios. Traditional methods rely on logical rules or statistical models, while GNNs automatically learn relational patterns between entities through message passing mechanisms for reasoning. In completion tasks, GNNs predict missing edges, improving completion accuracy and handling multi-hop reasoning problems.</p>
            <h3>Modeling of Dynamic Knowledge Graphs</h3>
            <p>Modeling dynamic knowledge graphs requires capturing the dynamic changes of entities and relationships. GNNs capture evolutionary patterns through time series modeling methods (such as temporal graph neural networks). By introducing timestamp information, GNNs propagate information across different time steps, learning dynamic changes, and are applied in fields such as predicting future events and recommendation systems.</p>

            <h2>Practical Applications of GNN and Knowledge Graph Fusion</h2>
            <h3>Knowledge Graph-Based Question Answering Systems</h3>
            <p>Question answering systems are an important application scenario. Traditional methods rely on template matching or keyword retrieval, making it difficult to handle complex natural language questions. Knowledge graph-based question answering systems using GNNs understand the semantic structure through deep learning, extract relevant entities and relationships, and generate accurate answers. In multi-hop question answering tasks, GNNs derive answer paths, improving accuracy and handling complex multi-step reasoning problems.</p>
            <h3>Knowledge Graph-Based Recommendation Systems</h3>
            <p>Recommendation systems are another important application scenario. Traditional methods are based on user-item interaction data, making it difficult to capture complex relationships. Knowledge graph-based recommendation systems map users, items, and their relationships to the KG to understand user behavior patterns. GNNs learn user and item representations through graph structure message passing, capturing implicit relationships, and improving recommendation accuracy and personalization.</p>
            <h3>Knowledge Graph-Based Intelligent Decision Support Systems</h3>
            <p>Intelligent decision support systems are an important application area. In complex scenarios such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management, decision-makers need to make decisions based on large amounts of structured and unstructured data. Knowledge graphs organize data into graph structures, and GNNs extract valuable information through deep learning. In financial risk control systems, GNNs predict potential risks; in medical diagnosis systems, GNNs assist doctors in diagnosis.</p>
