        <section>
            <p>Today, with the gig economy, remote collaboration, and project-based work becoming mainstream, the workplace is no longer a linear path defined by "9-to-5 schedules" and lifelong employment. Instead, we now face constantly reorganizing project networks, temporary team dynamics, and frequently shifting roles and identities. As organizational boundaries dissolve, the traditional career narrative centered on "position—promotion—belonging" collapses as well. At this point, workplace burnout is no longer merely a matter of "working too hard"; it has evolved into a <strong>existential anxiety</strong>—when "who I am" is no longer defined by an organization, how do we confirm our own value and existence?</p>

            <p>This is precisely the deep-seated dilemma that the "topology of meaning" seeks to address. Drawing from postmodern philosophy’s concept of "fluid identity" (Bauman, 2000) and organizational psychology’s "psychological ownership" (Pierce et al., 2001), it proposes that in decentralized workplaces, individuals must shift from being <strong>assigned identities by organizations</strong> to <strong>actively constructing meaning networks</strong>, achieving a paradigm shift from "professional identity" to "existential anchoring."</p>

            <h3>I. Fluid Identity: The "Deterritorialization" of Meaning</h3>
            <p>Bauman argues that in liquid modernity, identity is no longer fixed to institutions, positions, or geographical locations, but continuously reconstructed across different contexts. Freelancers, remote collaborators, and project-based workers are essentially carriers of the <strong>situational self</strong>—today you may be a designer, tomorrow a consultant, and the next day a content strategist. While this fluidity promises freedom, it often leads to meaning fragmentation due to a lack of continuity.</p>

            <p>At this point, traditional theories of "psychological ownership" must be reinterpreted: we no longer emotionally invest in a single organization, but rather develop a sense of belonging to <strong>cross-project capabilities, values, and relational networks</strong>. The key lies in how to weave fragmented experiences into a coherent and meaningful whole.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>II. Meaning Topology Map (MTM): A Compass for Navigating Dynamic Meaning Networks</h3>
            <p>We have developed the <strong>Meaning Topology Map</strong> (MTM), an interdisciplinary psychological counseling tool, consisting of three dimensions:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Skill Nodes</strong><br>
                    Identify transferable core competencies, such as "cross-cultural communication," "systems thinking," or "user insight." These skills are not tied to any specific company but serve as portable "anchors of meaning" that individuals carry through their fluid journeys.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Value Links</strong><br>
                    Record the deeper motivations behind each project: Is it to solve social problems? To drive innovation? To help others grow? These non-instrumental values form "chains of meaning," lending internal coherence to otherwise scattered work experiences.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Relational Topography</strong><br>
                    Map key collaborators, clients, and beneficiaries to form a "social circle of meaning." Relationships are not merely resources—they are witnesses to meaning. "I am confirmed in my existence by the impact I have on others."
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p><em>For example, a remote data analyst discovered that although projects came from different platforms, he consistently worked along the value line of "using data to reveal inequality." The discovery of this "meaning pattern" significantly strengthened his psychological ownership.</em></p>
        </section>

            <h3>III. Self-Anchoring Techniques: Establishing Stability Amidst Fluidity</h3>
            <p>The MTM is not merely a recording tool, but a vehicle for <strong>ritualized practice</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initiation Ritual</strong>: At the start of a project, clarify "Why am I involved?"—transforming tasks into meaningful actions;</li>
                <li><strong>Closure Ritual</strong>: Conduct "meaning extraction" to distill skill growth, value realization, and relationship deepening;</li>
                <li><strong>Annual Integration</strong>: Review the MTM to identify recurring "meaning themes," such as "I have consistently advanced transparency and justice."</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This process operationalizes existential psychology’s concept of "self-creation." As Sartre said, "Man is the sum of his choices"—in an era lacking external narratives, we become "topologists of our own lives" through <strong>conscious reflection and documentation</strong>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>IV. From Attachment to Autonomy: The Philosophical Foundation of Existential Anchoring</h3>
            <p>The ultimate goal of the MTM is to help individuals achieve an <strong>ontological shift</strong>: no longer relying on organizations to provide meaning, but developing the capacity for <strong>self-witnessing</strong> (self-witnessing). When Mr. Chen realizes that "I have always used design to foster social connection," he no longer worries about "the next project," but instead asks, "What is the next project that can deepen my values?"</p>

            <p>This is the new mission of psychological counseling in decentralized workplaces: rather than striving for "recognition by an organization," we aim to <strong>become our own coordinates in the flux</strong>. There may be no permanent positions, but there is continuous growth of meaning; there may be no stable organizations, but there are transferable networks of value.</p>
