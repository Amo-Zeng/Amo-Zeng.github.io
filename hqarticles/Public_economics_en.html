            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Climate change presents a global challenge, posing new demands and challenges to public economics. Public economics must explore how fiscal policy can effectively address the economic impacts of climate change, including the implementation of adaptation and mitigation measures, and how to coordinate public fiscal policies across different countries and regions. This article aims to delve into the effects of climate change on public economics, analyze the optimal use of public funds, and discuss the necessity and feasibility of coordinating public fiscal policies at a global level. By integrating the latest research data and empirical analysis, this article seeks to provide new perspectives and methods for theoretical innovation and practical application in public economics.</p>

            <h3>Impact of Climate Change on Public Economics</h3>
            <h4>Economic Losses</h4>
            <p><strong>Direct Economic Losses</strong>: Extreme weather events caused by climate change (like floods, droughts, hurricanes, etc.) directly increase economic losses for public finance. According to the World Bank's latest report, climate change could lead to an annual loss of approximately 5% to 20% of global GDP. In 2021 alone, the economic losses due to extreme weather events were about $280 billion worldwide.</p>
            <p><strong>Reconstruction Costs</strong>: The cost of rebuilding and restoring infrastructure after disasters puts significant pressure on public finances. For example, Hurricane Harvey in 2017 caused direct economic losses of over $125 billion in the U.S., with the government shouldering most of the reconstruction costs.</p>

            <h4>Decline in Productivity</h4>
            <p><strong>Agricultural Productivity</strong>: Climate change affects the productivity of key industries like agriculture, fisheries, and tourism. According to the FAO, global agricultural yield is expected to decrease by 25% by 2050 due to climate change. In Sub-Saharan Africa, frequent droughts and floods caused by climate change have severely impacted local agricultural production and economic stability.</p>
            <p><strong>Other Industries</strong>: Fisheries and tourism are also affected; rising sea levels and ocean acidification reduce fish catches, while extreme weather conditions impact tourism development.</p>

            <h4>Increased Health Expenditures</h4>
            <p><strong>Disease Spread</strong>: The spread of diseases due to climate change increases public health expenditures. In tropical and subtropical regions, the burden of diseases like dengue fever, malaria, and diarrheal diseases has significantly increased.</p>
            <p><strong>Air Quality</strong>: Medical costs and labor losses due to air pollution further burden public finances. The WHO estimates that climate change-related health costs could reach billions of dollars annually.</p>

            <h3>Optimal Use of Public Funds in Adaptation and Mitigation of Climate Change</h3>
            <h4>Adaptation Measures</h4>
            <p><strong>Infrastructure Transformation</strong>: Public funds should be prioritized for enhancing the adaptive capacity of social and economic systems. For example, the Netherlands' "Climate-Proof Cities" initiative has significantly improved urban flood resistance through infrastructure transformations like increasing urban green spaces, improving building energy efficiency, and constructing flood and sea defenses.</p>
            <p><strong>Community Capacity Building</strong>: Providing training and education to enhance community resilience and awareness. For instance, Bangladesh's "Climate Adaptation Community" project has bolstered local community disaster resilience through training and resource support, reducing losses from disasters.</p>

            <h4>Mitigation Measures</h4>
            <p><strong>Renewable Energy Subsidies</strong>: Encouraging the use of solar, wind, and other renewable energies through fiscal subsidies and tax incentives. Germany's "Energiewende" policy has significantly increased the proportion of renewable energy in its energy mix through substantial subsidies and support.</p>
            <p><strong>Low-Carbon Technology Investments</strong>: Supporting R&D and promotion of low-carbon technologies like electric vehicles and energy-efficient equipment. China's investment in electric vehicle technology has made it the world's largest EV market, significantly reducing carbon emissions in the transport sector.</p>

            <h4>Research and Development</h4>
            <p><strong>Climate Model Research</strong>: Funding universities and research institutions to develop climate prediction models. For example, the U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA) provides detailed assessments of climate change impacts and response strategies through extensive research and data analysis.</p>
            <p><strong>Technological Innovation</strong>: Supporting the development of new climate-adaptive technologies, like drought-resistant crops and heat-resistant building materials. Australia's "Climate-Adapted Crop" research project has developed a range of drought and heat-tolerant crops, significantly enhancing agricultural climate resilience.</p>

            <h3>Necessity and Feasibility of Coordinating Public Fiscal Policies Globally</h3>
            <h4>Transboundary Coordination</h4>
            <p><strong>International Agreements</strong>: Climate change has transboundary effects, necessitating global coordination and cooperation. The Paris Agreement provides a framework for global climate cooperation, with over 190 countries having joined by 2023, committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change.</p>

            <h4>Financial Flows</h4>
            <p><strong>Global Climate Funds</strong>: Establishing global climate finance mechanisms like the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to help developing countries cope with climate change and economic transition. For example, a GCF-funded project in Kenya has significantly improved local community resilience by building climate-adaptive infrastructure and providing technical support.</p>

            <h4>Policy Consistency</h4>
            <p><strong>Reducing Conflicts</strong>: Ensuring consistency in climate policies across countries to reduce policy conflicts and market distortions. The EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) ensures the fairness of international trade by imposing carbon taxes on imports, covering sectors like steel, cement, and aluminum by 2023, significantly enhancing the carbon intensity within the EU.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The impact of climate change on public economics is profound and complex, requiring a response from public economics in both theory and practice. The optimal use of public funds in adapting to and mitigating climate change is key to achieving sustainable development goals. Meanwhile, global coordination of public fiscal policies is an effective way to tackle transboundary climate challenges. Moving forward, public economics needs to further deepen research on climate change response strategies, promote international cooperation, and ensure the effectiveness and equity of public fiscal policies in dealing with climate change. Through global coordination and innovative fiscal policies, we can better address the challenges posed by climate change and drive global economic transformation towards sustainability.</p>
