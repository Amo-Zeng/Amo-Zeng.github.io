            <h2>Introduction: The Historization of Ecological Fracture</h2>
            <p>The crises of modern agriculture—soil degradation, groundwater depletion, genetic homogenization of crops, and waves of farmer suicides—are often attributed to "technological overreach" or "market failure." Yet such explanations obscure a deeper <strong>structural fracture</strong>: the systematic dismantling of long-standing relational networks between human bodies, non-human species, and institutional arrangements. This fracture is not a natural evolution, but a historical product of <strong>ecological disembedding</strong> under modern governance. This article proposes "<strong>relational ecology</strong>" as an analytical framework to reveal the <strong>dynamic, asymmetrical, and embodied co-constitution</strong> among body, species, and institution in agricultural transformation, asking: when these relations are institutionally fractured, how are ecological consequences historically produced and reproduced?</p>

            <p>This framework does not nostalgically return to a romanticized "harmony between heaven and humanity," but engages deeply with <strong>Foucault's "biopolitics"</strong>, <strong>Haraway's "Cyborg Manifesto"</strong>, <strong>Hardt and Negri's "the multitude"</strong>, and <strong>Anna Tsing's "mushrooms growing in ruins"</strong>. It challenges the traditional environmental history binary of nature/culture, human/non-human, and critiques political ecology's institutional determinism, instead focusing on the <strong>multi-agentivity</strong> (multi-agentivity) that emerges and collapses within specific historical contexts.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>I. The Body: The "Ecological Interface" Under Discipline</h2>
            <p>The "body" in agricultural history is not merely a passive tool of labor, but an <strong>embodied node of ecological relations</strong>. In traditional paddy farming societies (e.g., Jiangnan in China, Kansai in Japan), farmers' feet and the muddy soil layers formed a symbiotic adaptation: long-term barefoot cultivation thickened the foot's keratin layer, creating a natural barrier against pathogens; simultaneously, farmers used tactile sensation to assess soil moisture and fertility, achieving a <strong>somatic coupling</strong> (somatic coupling) between body and soil. This coupling already existed in Foucault's sense of the "disciplined body," but unlike the factory assembly line, it manifested as <strong>non-institutionalized, context-specific knowledge production</strong>.</p>

            <p>However, the Green Revolution of the mid-20th century <strong>de-agentialized</strong> the farmer's body. In Punjab, India, groundwater extraction increased by <strong>470%</strong> from 1970 to 2020<span class="data-source">(CGWB, 2021)</span>, while farmers were institutionally reduced to "technology adopters": the state promoted high-water-demand wheat varieties (e.g., Kalyan Sona), provided chemical fertilizers and irrigation subsidies, yet shifted water management responsibility to individuals. The body transformed from a "sensing-regulating" system into an "input-output" machine, <strong>severing the symbiotic perception between foot and soil</strong>, replaced by anxiety over electricity meters, water gauges, and loan cycles. This <strong>disembodiment</strong> is the agricultural version of Foucault's "biopower": the state indirectly controls the body through <strong>biological regulation</strong> (e.g., seed distribution, credit access).</p>

            <blockquote>
                <em>More profoundly, this control operates through "ecological debt."</em> Farmers over-extract groundwater to repay loans, creating a vicious cycle of "borrow more, extract more, become poorer." In 2018, the loan default rate among Punjabi farmers reached <strong>23.6%</strong><span class="data-source">(NSSO 77th Round)</span>, embedding the body within the reproductive chain of <em>financialized ecology</em>. Here, Haraway's "cyborg" theory is inverted: farmers are not merging with machines, but <em>being consumed by machine logic</em>, becoming the "interface" of a capital-technology-ecology complex.
            </blockquote>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>II. Species: The Institutionalized "Non-Human Agency"</h2>
            <p>In traditional agriculture, species (crops, livestock, microbes) possess <strong>institutional agency</strong>, where their very existence constitutes governance structures. For example, the "rice-fish-duck" system in Hani terraces of Yunnan is not "natural symbiosis," but <strong>institutionally embedded</strong> through village rotation, water allocation, and ritual ceremonies. Fish eat pests, duck droppings fertilize the soil, and rice roots stabilize it—forming a <strong>institutionally sustained ecological cycle</strong>, whose stability depends on the <strong>symbolic empowerment</strong> of non-human species within local institutions (e.g., ducks as "messengers of water deities").</p>

            <p>The Green Revolution shattered this institutional agency. High-yield wheat and hybrid corn were symbolically elevated to "national food security," while local varieties (e.g., Indian Aus rice, Chinese red rice) were stigmatized as "low-yielding" and "backward." Species selection shifted from <strong>ecological embeddedness</strong> to <strong>standardization dominated by state-capital complexes</strong>. In this process, species' "agency" was redefined: no longer as "actors" in local governance, but as <strong>managed resources</strong>.</p>

            <blockquote>
                Anna Tsing, in <em>The Mushroom at the End of the World</em>, reveals how non-human life (e.g., matsutake mushrooms) rebuilds relational networks in ruins. But in agriculture, species fracture is marked by <em>institutional violence</em>. Take U.S. corn: in 2020, <strong>92%</strong> was Monsanto's GMO varieties<span class="data-source">(USDA, 2021)</span>. Seed patent laws prevent farmers from saving seeds, legally stripping species of their "reproductive agency." Crucially, this disempowerment is enacted through <em>agricultural extension systems</em>: technicians stigmatize local varieties as "pest-prone" or "herbicide-sensitive," transforming biodiversity into a symbol of "technological backwardness." Species thus shift from <em>participants in relational ecology</em> to <em>victims of institutional fracture</em>.
            </blockquote>

            <p><em>Notably, this fracture is not unidirectional.</em> Some species "reverse-agency" in institutional interstices. For example, "heirloom" rice varieties in Southwest China regain market value in ecological farms and CSAs (Community-Supported Agriculture), as farmers rebuild "human-rice" relations through <strong>consumer alliances</strong>. This echoes Hardt and Negri's "the multitude": non-human life and marginalized groups form <strong>resistant ecological networks</strong>, forging "alternative agricultural practices" outside dominant institutions.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>III. Institutions: The Production and Reproduction of Fracture</h2>
            <p>Institutions serve as the <strong>structural mediators</strong> of body-species relations, yet they too undergo fracture. Traditional agricultural institutions (e.g., village councils, irrigation associations, crop rotation cycles) possess <strong>ecological feedback mechanisms</strong>: declining yields trigger institutional adjustments (e.g., fallow periods, water reallocation). In contrast, modern institutions (e.g., credit, insurance, futures markets) are built on <strong>linear growth assumptions</strong>, externalizing ecological risks.</p>

            <p>In the U.S. Corn Belt, federal subsidies and futures markets "hedge" price volatility, masking the ecological cost of soil organic matter declining from <strong>3.5% to 1.8%</strong><span class="data-source">(NRCS, 2019)</span>. With "insurance backstops," farmers expand monoculture, as institutions encourage <strong>ecological risk accumulation</strong>. This embodies Hardt's concept of "<strong>imperial governance</strong>": institutions do not resolve contradictions, but delay and displace them via financial instruments.</p>

            <p>The mechanism of institutional fracture reproduction lies in <strong>triple disembedding</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Economic disembedding</strong>: agriculture shifts from subsistence to commodity economy, where price signals replace ecological signals;</li>
                <li><strong>Epistemic disembedding</strong>: extension systems exclude local knowledge, monopolizing "scientific" authority by expert systems;</li>
                <li><strong>Temporal disembedding</strong>: short-term market cycles replace long-term ecological cycles (e.g., groundwater recharge takes decades).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This disembedding was exposed during the 2008 financial crisis: U.S. farm loan defaults peaked at <strong>14.3%</strong><span class="data-source">(USDA, 2009)</span>, forcing farmers to sell land and abandon ecological management. Institutions did not repair fractures, but <strong>financialized them</strong>—land became speculative asset, and ecological relations were further commodified.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: The Analytical Significance of Relational Ecology</h2>
            <p>"Relational ecology" is not a description of an "ideal state," but an <strong>analytical tool</strong> for revealing the <strong>dynamic co-constitution and structural fractures</strong> among body, species, and institution in agricultural history. Its theoretical boundaries are clear:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It <strong>rejects reductionism</strong> (does not attribute ecological problems to a single cause);</li>
                <li>It <strong>rejects romanticization</strong> (does not idealize traditional agriculture as "perfect balance");</li>
                <li>It <strong>rejects anthropocentrism</strong> (emphasizes non-human agency, but not "animism");</li>
                <li>It <strong>rejects institutional determinism</strong> (institutions are mediators, not root causes).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This framework has potential implications for three fields:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Environmental History</strong>: shifts focus from "natural history" to "relational history," emphasizing <strong>embodied practices</strong> (e.g., barefoot farming), <strong>non-human actors</strong> (e.g., rice-fish systems), and <strong>institutional fractures</strong> (e.g., subsidy policies);</li>
                <li><strong>Agricultural Anthropology</strong>: moves beyond "cultural adaptation," proposing the concept of <strong>ecological agency</strong> to analyze how farmers rebuild relational networks in institutional interstices (e.g., CSAs, seed banks);</li>
                <li><strong>Political Ecology</strong>: challenges the "state-capital" binary critique, introducing a <strong>multi-agentivity</strong> lens to reveal <strong>non-human participation</strong> in ecological resistance (e.g., species' reverse selection, microbial community shifts).</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Ultimately, relational ecology reminds us: the agricultural crisis is not a technical question of "how to farm," but a deeper one of <strong>how to reconnect</strong>—between body and soil, species and institution, past and future. As Anna Tsing writes, "<em>symbiosis always begins in ruins</em>." In the fractures, we may find the starting point of relational rebuilding: not a return to pre-modernity, but through <strong>decentralized practices</strong>, allowing bodies to re-sense the soil, species to reclaim agency, and institutions to learn to listen to the silence of ecology.</p>
