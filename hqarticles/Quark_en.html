            <h2>Introduction: From "Imprisonment" to "Encryption"</h2>
            <p>In the Standard Model, quarks are the fundamental constituents of hadrons, yet they can never be observed in isolation—a phenomenon known as "quark confinement," traditionally interpreted as a non-perturbative effect in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). But if we move beyond the passive metaphor of "imprisonment" and reexamine this from the viewpoint of quantum information science, we may discover: quarks are not imprisoned prisoners, but rather the universe’s most sophisticated <strong>information-theoretic topological lock</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Topological Order Inside Hadrons</h3>
            <p>Within a hadron, the quark and gluon fields do not form a static configuration, but rather a dynamic <strong>topological order</strong>. Unlike conventional matter with local degrees of freedom, the ground state of a hadron exhibits long-range quantum entanglement. This entanglement does not decay with distance; instead, it is sustained through the non-Abelian gauge structure (SU(3) symmetry) of the gluon field in a <strong>topological manner</strong>. In other words, the information of quarks is not "hidden at a point," but <strong>non-locally woven into the entire topological configuration of the hadron</strong>—much like a quantum error-correcting code, where local perturbations cannot extract the encoded information without destroying the entire topological structure.</p>

            <h3>Striking Similarity to Topological Quantum Computing</h3>
            <p>This mechanism bears a striking resemblance to <strong>anyons</strong> and <strong>topological codes</strong> (e.g., the Toric code) in topological quantum computing. In such codes, quantum information is stored in global topological degrees of freedom, making it inaccessible to local measurements—thus inherently resistant to noise. Quark confinement is an extreme version of this principle: the QCD vacuum possesses complex topological structures (e.g., instantons, magnetic monopole condensates), and hadrons resemble "topological defects" embedded in this vacuum. The color charge of internal quarks is "topologically screened." Attempting to separate quarks is equivalent to introducing a "color flux tube" in the topological field, but when the tube breaks, new quark-antiquark pairs are generated—information is not extracted, but instead <em>copied</em> into new hadrons. This is, in essence, a <strong>cosmic-level tamper-proof protocol</strong>: any attempt to read quark information triggers information replication and re-encoding, rather than data leakage.</p>

            <h3>Strong Interaction: A Self-Protecting Quantum Information System</h3>
            <p>More profoundly, this suggests that the strong interaction may be a <strong>self-protecting quantum information system</strong>. During the early universe, as the quark-gluon plasma cooled, the phase transition into color confinement did not merely produce hadrons—it also "locked" the form in which quantum information could be expressed. What we observe is not the quark itself, but its <strong>topological projection</strong>—akin to pixels in a hologram: a single point carries no meaning; only the whole encodes information. The existence of quarks is not meant to be "seen," but rather to <strong>ensure the integrity of information across extreme scales</strong>.</p>

            <h3>"Invisibility" Is a Feature, Not a Bug</h3>
            <p>Counterintuitively, the "invisibility" of quarks is not a flaw, but a feature. Quarks are not imprisoned; they actively choose to <strong>hide themselves in a topological way</strong>, preventing the universe's underlying information from being disrupted by local operations. This may explain why the strong interaction is so "stubborn"—it is not merely a physical force, but an <strong>enforcement mechanism for information conservation</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Quarks: The Universe's Primitive Encryption Units</h3>
            <p>Under this new paradigm, quarks emerge as the universe’s most primitive "encryption units." Their existence marks the ultimate fusion of physics and information: <strong>not that matter carries information, but that information defines the possible forms of matter</strong>. Hadrons are not containers, but topological keys; quarks are not content, but the algorithms that generate those keys.</p>
            <p>We may never "see" a quark directly—but this is not a failure of science, but a testament to the universe’s ingenuity. It uses topological locks to protect the underlying code of reality, and quarks are the one-of-a-kind quantum key—irreproducible, indivisible, and eternally secure.</p>
