            <h2>The Interwoven Evolution of Semantics and AI</h2>
            <p>The interwoven evolution of semantics and artificial intelligence is akin to a grand narrative across disciplinary boundaries, transitioning from static symbolic representation to dynamic distributed representation, and from a single sociocultural structure to a diverse cognitive model, outlining the profound interaction between human language and thought. This journey not only reflects the progress of technology and science but also mirrors the profound changes in sociocultural and cognitive patterns.</p>

            <h3>Symbolic Representation and the Industrial Era of Static Meaning</h3>
            <p>The early development of artificial intelligence was deeply rooted in the paradigm of symbolic representation. The symbolic paradigm posits that human thought processes can be simulated through symbolic operations, and early expert systems were a concentrated expression of this idea. The advantage of symbolic representation lies in its clear structure and rigorous logic, allowing for the simulation of expert knowledge in specific domains through explicit rule systems. However, this representation also faces significant limitations: it struggles to handle the ambiguity and vagueness in natural language, fails to capture complex semantic relationships between linguistic symbols, and is ill-equipped to manage the demands of handling massive datasets.</p>

            <h3>Distributed Representation and the Cognitive Shift of Dynamic Meaning</h3>
            <p>With the advancement of computing power and the advent of the big data era, deep learning has emerged as a powerful force, providing new insights into semantic representation—distributed representation. The core idea of distributed representation is to store semantic information across multiple neurons in a neural network, automatically learning and extracting semantic features from text, images, and other data through multi-layered neural network structures, and mapping them to a high-dimensional vector space.</p>

            <h3>The Symphony of Language and Cognition</h3>
            <p>The relationship between language and cognition is like a never-ending river, constantly flowing forward under the nourishment of semantics and cognitive science. Cognitive science has opened a new door for the study of semantics, with the functionalist paradigm emphasizing the collaborative role of the language processing system with perception, memory, and other cognitive systems, while neurocognitive linguistics delves into the microscopic world of the brain to reveal the neural basis of language processing.</p>

            <h3>Looking Ahead from Symbols to Distribution</h3>
            <p>The evolution from symbolic representation to distributed representation is not merely a change in semantic representation methods but also a shift in the research paradigm of artificial intelligence. Symbolic representation symbolizes the "rule-driven" era of AI, emphasizing the explicit representation of human knowledge and logical reasoning, while distributed representation heralds the arrival of the "data-driven" era of AI, focusing on learning from data and automatically extracting semantic information through models.</p>
