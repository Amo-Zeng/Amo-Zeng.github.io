            <h2>The Ethics, Politics, and Culture of Nuclear Energy: The Interweaving of Time, Space, and Narrative</h2>
            <p>Nuclear energy, as one of the most revolutionary technological achievements of the 20th century, is not only a key to energy transition but also a complex and multifaceted issue in the progress of human civilization. It carries the hope of addressing climate change, yet it is accompanied by undeniable risks and ethical dilemmas. From temporality and spatial politics to cultural narratives, the discussion of nuclear energy transcends the realms of technology and policy, delving into the aspects of human existence, international relations, and collective memory. This article will explore the multidimensional significance of nuclear energy in ethical responsibility, geopolitics, and cultural imagination from these three perspectives, and attempt to construct a more profound and comprehensive view of nuclear energy development.</p>

            <h3>I. Temporal Perspective: Nuclear Energy and Ethical Responsibility to Future Generations</h3>
            <p>One of the core issues of nuclear energy lies in the uniqueness of its temporal dimension. As an efficient energy source, nuclear energy can provide clean electricity for contemporary society, but its associated radioactive waste and potential accident risks may affect future generations for hundreds or even thousands of years. This "benefits now, risks later" model makes nuclear energy a profound intergenerational ethical issue.</p>
            <p>The concept of the "critical age" proposed by German philosopher Jaspers reminds us that our current choices may have far-reaching impacts on future generations. French philosopher Levinas emphasizes that ethical responsibility is not only directed at the present but also encompasses future generations yet to be born. In the context of nuclear energy, this responsibility is reflected in the question: Do we have the right to impose a high-risk legacy that spans temporal limits on future generations? They cannot participate in the decision-making process nor escape its consequences.</p>
            <p>The long-term risks of nuclear waste, the irreversibility of nuclear accidents, and the imbalance in intergenerational resource allocation constitute the core of the ethical challenges of nuclear energy. For example, the radioactive half-life of high-level waste can last for tens of thousands of years, while nuclear accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima have impacts that span generations, becoming "trauma geology" that is difficult to erase over time. Facing these challenges, we need to establish future-oriented democratic participation mechanisms, develop preventive ethical frameworks, and actively explore non-nuclear alternatives to alleviate the ethical burden on future generations.</p>

            <h3>II. Spatial Politics Perspective: Nuclear Energy and the "Reconstruction of Invisible Boundaries" in Geopolitics</h3>
            <p>Nuclear energy is not only an energy issue but also a significant variable in geopolitics. The siting of nuclear power plants, the disposal of nuclear waste, and the transfer of nuclear technology all involve the core interests of national sovereignty and security, and they invisibly reconstruct the "invisible boundaries" between nations. For example, the siting of nuclear power plants not only considers geographical conditions but also assesses their potential impact on neighboring countries, effectively redefining national security boundaries.</p>
            <p>International cooperation in the field of nuclear energy, such as technology transfer and nuclear fuel supply, often comes with political conditions attached, further reshaping the network of international relations. At the same time, nuclear safety issues like nuclear leaks and nuclear terrorism are global challenges that require collective international responses. The establishment and improvement of nuclear safety cooperation mechanisms are not only an important part of global governance but also a significant driving force in the reconstruction of "invisible boundaries" in geopolitics.</p>
            <p>In the context of globalization, the geopolitical significance of nuclear energy is becoming increasingly prominent. How to promote international cooperation while ensuring nuclear safety, and avoid nuclear energy becoming a new trigger for geopolitical conflicts, is an important issue facing the international community.</p>

            <h3>III. Cultural Narrative Perspective: The Construction of Nuclear Energy's Image in Collective Memory and Cultural Imagination</h3>
            <p>The image of nuclear energy in cultural narratives has undergone a transformation from utopia to dystopia. In the mid-20th century, nuclear energy was endowed with the symbolic meaning of "progress" and "future," becoming a symbol of technological utopia. However, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as nuclear accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima, quickly shifted the image of nuclear energy to dystopia, making it synonymous with uncontrollable, destructive power.</p>
            <p>The sedimentation of these historical events in collective memory has tightly linked nuclear energy with trauma, risk, and uncertainty. Nuclear energy is no longer just a symbol of technological progress but has become a metaphor for the complex relationship between humans and nature, technology and ethics. In recent years, with the intensification of climate change issues, the potential of nuclear energy as a low-carbon energy source has once again garnered attention, and its image in cultural imagination has gradually shifted from fear to hope. However, public fear and distrust of nuclear energy remain deeply rooted, and issues like nuclear waste disposal and nuclear proliferation continue to be major obstacles to nuclear energy development.</p>
            <p>In future cultural narratives, the image of nuclear energy may become more diverse. How to balance the hope and fear of nuclear energy in cultural imagination, and how to promote public rational understanding of nuclear energy through narrative, will be important topics in nuclear energy narratives.</p>

            <h3>IV. Conclusion: The Future of Nuclear Energy - The Interweaving of Ethics, Politics, and Culture</h3>
            <p>Nuclear energy is not just an energy choice but a complex issue involving human existence, international relations, and collective memory. From a temporal perspective, nuclear energy requires us to take on ethical responsibility for the future; from a spatial politics perspective, nuclear energy reconstructs the "invisible boundaries" of geopolitics; from a cultural narrative perspective, the image of nuclear energy continues to evolve in collective memory and cultural imagination.</p>
            <p>Facing the "intergenerational ledger" and geopolitical challenges of nuclear energy, we need to examine the ethical relationship between humans and nature and time with a more humble and long-term mindset. At the same time, through diverse cultural narratives, we may find a more balanced and rational way to face nuclear energy, a technological product that is both full of potential and challenges. Only by taking responsibility in time, seeking cooperation in space, and balancing hope and fear in narrative can we achieve a truly sustainable and ethical energy path.</p>
            <p>The future of nuclear energy is not just the future of technology but the future of human civilization.</p>
