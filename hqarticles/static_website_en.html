            <h2>Static Websites: A Development Tool of the New Era and the Gateway to the Future</h2>
            <p>In today's world dominated by dynamic websites and single-page applications (SPAs), static websites may seem somewhat "outdated." However, this seemingly simple technology is making a remarkable comeback into mainstream focus, showcasing impressive advantages. Static websites are not just a choice for minimalists; they have become a secret weapon for full-stack developers and have opened the door to the future of the internet in the era of serverless architecture.</p>

            <h3>Performance and Security: Inherent Advantages of Static Websites</h3>
            <p>The core advantage of static websites lies in their "static" nature: all page content is generated on the server side and exists as static files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without the need for database queries or server-side rendering. This characteristic gives static websites unparalleled performance and security:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ultimate Speed</strong>: Static files can be pre-generated and cached, allowing users to directly access them from the server or CDN without waiting for dynamic content generation and rendering. This results in faster page loading and a smoother user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>High Security</strong>: Due to the absence of dynamic content, static websites have virtually no vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting attacks. The attack surface is significantly reduced, making the website more secure and reliable.</li>
                <li><strong>High Reliability</strong>: Once generated, static files can be stored and accessed stably for a long time, unaffected by server failures or database crashes. This ensures the website operates more reliably.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Secret Weapon of Full-Stack Developers</h3>
            <p>These advantages make static websites a secret weapon for full-stack developers, for the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full Control</strong>: From development to deployment, the entire process of static websites is controlled by the developer, enabling more customized development and faster iteration.</li>
                <li><strong>Freedom of Technology Stack</strong>: Static websites do not rely on specific server-side technology stacks. Full-stack developers can freely choose front-end frameworks, build tools, deployment platforms, etc., resulting in higher flexibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient Collaboration</strong>: The project structure of static websites is clear, with small file sizes, making it easier for team collaboration and version control, thereby improving development efficiency.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Evolution of Static Websites</h3>
            <p>Static websites are not static; they have undergone dramatic changes with the progress of technology and the iteration of tools:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Interactivity</strong>: With the help of JavaScript frameworks (such as React, Vue.js) and APIs, static websites can achieve complex dynamic interaction features, such as search, comments, user login, etc.</li>
            </ul>
