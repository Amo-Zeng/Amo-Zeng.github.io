            <p>As algorithms become deeply embedded in social information dissemination and cognitive construction, semantics is no longer merely a static expression of language, but has evolved into a dynamic "ecosystem." This paper introduces the concept of the <strong>Digital Semantic Ecosystem</strong> (DSE), emphasizing how meaning continuously reconstructs itself through the interplay of technological architecture, collective memory, and user feedback. Based on a <strong>three-dimensional analytical model</strong>—technology, memory, and feedback—this paper systematically examines the mechanisms of semantic generation, evolutionary pathways, and governance challenges in the algorithmic age, and envisions the possibility of <strong>Digital Semantics</strong> as a new interdisciplinary research paradigm.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section">
            <h2>I. Theoretical Framework: The Three-Dimensional Model of Technology-Memory-Feedback</h2>
            <p>The Digital Semantic Ecosystem (DSE) is composed of three interlocking core dimensions: <strong>technological architecture</strong> (Technology), <strong>collective memory</strong> (Memory), and <strong>user feedback</strong> (Feedback), forming a closed-loop evolutionary mechanism (see Figure 1).</p>
            <div class="figure">
                (Figure 1: Conceptual diagram of the Technology-Memory-Feedback 3D model)
            </div>
            <h3>Technological Architecture</h3>
            <p>Technological architecture serves as the foundational logic for semantic generation. Recommendation algorithms, natural language processing (NLP) models, knowledge graphs, and generative AI (e.g., large language models, LLMs) collectively constitute the "technical grammar" of semantics. Algorithms transform language into computable vector spaces through word embeddings, attention mechanisms, and semantic similarity calculations, thereby redefining the boundaries and associations of meaning. For example, BERT generates context-sensitive vector representations, allowing the word "freedom" to carry different semantic weights across contexts (see Vaswani et al., 2017). More critically, the "black-box" nature of algorithms leads to a lack of transparency in semantic generation, giving rise to an <em>algorithmic semantic hegemony</em>—where algorithms implicitly define what constitutes "reasonable expression" through training data and optimization objectives (see Chen et al., 2023, on the quantitative study of algorithmic memory politics).</p>
            <h3>Collective Memory</h3>
            <p>Collective memory acts as the "historical anchor" of semantics. In digital spaces, meaning does not emerge ex nihilo; it inherits and reconfigures pre-existing social cognitive frameworks. Algorithms continuously activate specific historical texts, cultural symbols, and public events through crawling, indexing, and recommendation, forming what we call <em>algorithmic collective memory</em>. For instance, the persistent recontextualization of the 9/11 attacks on social media has led algorithms to reinforce associations between "terrorism" and specific ethnic or religious groups, creating a <em>historical inertia</em> in semantics (see Zhao, 2022). This algorithmic reconstruction of memory endows semantics with a <em>path dependency</em> over time, exacerbating polarization and semantic rigidity.</p>
            <h3>User Feedback</h3>
            <p>User feedback functions as the "selective pressure" driving semantic evolution. Likes, comments, shares, and search behaviors form feedback signals for algorithmic training, creating a positive feedback loop between behavior and semantics. For example, on short-video platforms, frequent use of the term "lying flat" (tangping) and its emotionally charged commentary have led algorithms to strongly associate it with labels like "anti-hustle culture" and "youth anxiety," thereby driving its generalization and emotionalization in public discourse (see Liu & Wang, 2023). This <em>behavior-driven semantic drift</em> reveals that users are not merely consumers of meaning, but co-producers of semantics.</p>
            <p>Together, these three dimensions form a dynamic closed loop: technological architecture sets the initial rules for semantic generation; collective memory provides historical resources for semantic evolution; and user feedback, through behavioral signals, selects and reinforces specific semantic pathways, in turn influencing algorithmic parameter updates and memory weight allocation—creating a synergistic co-evolutionary mechanism of "technology-memory-feedback."</p>

            <h2>II. Case Studies: Empirical Validation of the 3D Model</h2>
            <h3 class="case-title">Case 1: The Semantic Evolution of "Lockdown" during the COVID-19 Pandemic</h3>
            <p>Between 2020 and 2022, the term "lockdown" evolved through three stages: from a "necessary public health measure" to a "symbol of social cost," and finally to a "focal point of policy controversy."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technological Architecture</strong>: In the early stage, mainstream media and official discourse dominated semantic production. Algorithms reinforced narratives like "lockdown = scientific pandemic control" through keyword matching and weighting of authoritative sources. NLP models trained on terms such as "dynamic zero-COVID" and "precision control" established strong positive associations between "lockdown" and concepts like "efficiency" and "responsibility."</li>
                <li><strong>Collective Memory</strong>: As the pandemic persisted, public memories of the 2020 Wuhan lockdown were frequently activated by algorithms, shaping emotional frameworks like "lockdown = sacrifice" and "lockdown = uncertainty." Personal narratives such as "difficulty buying groceries" or "medical access problems" were amplified through algorithmic recommendations, redefining the semantic boundaries of "lockdown."</li>
                <li><strong>User Feedback</strong>: Negative comments and emotionally charged shares related to "lockdown" generated high feedback signals, prompting algorithms to adjust their recommendation strategies—prioritizing content on "lockdown impacts" and "secondary disasters," further pushing the semantics toward a critical direction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This case demonstrates that semantic evolution is not linear, but the result of a tripartite negotiation among technological weight, historical memory, and user sentiment. Algorithms initially "shape" semantics, but later "respond" to them, forming a <em>semantic feedback spiral</em>.</p>
            <h3 class="case-title">Case 2: The Construction of "Hallucination" Semantics in Generative AI</h3>
            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate "hallucinations"—semantically plausible but factually baseless outputs. However, these "hallucinations" are not mere errors, but "reasonable inferences" produced within semantic space.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technological Architecture</strong>: LLMs use autoregressive generation to detect semantic association patterns in training data. When models encounter frequent co-occurrence of "quantum entanglement" and "telepathy" in certain pseudoscientific texts, they may generate seemingly plausible statements like "quantum telepathy." This <em>semantic association</em> is an inherent outcome of the technical architecture (see Bender et al., 2021).</li>
                <li><strong>Collective Memory</strong>: Pseudoscientific discourse has long existed in digital spaces. Algorithms incorporate these marginal semantics into training data through web crawling, creating "memory pollution." Public ambiguity around terms like "quantum" or "energy fields" further reinforces the acceptability of hallucinatory semantics.</li>
                <li><strong>User Feedback</strong>: When users employ "quantum telepathy" in creative writing or philosophical discussions, its "novelty" receives high engagement, leading algorithms to misinterpret it as "valuable content," thereby increasing its generative probability and forming a <em>hallucination-feedback-reinforcement loop</em>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This case reveals: algorithms do not "make mistakes," but rather "generate reasonable meaning from erroneous data." The governance challenge is not to eliminate hallucinations, but to reconstruct the <em>mechanism of truth evaluation</em> in semantics.</p>

            <h2>III. Governance Challenges: Reallocating Semantic Power</h2>
            <p>The evolution of the Digital Semantic Ecosystem presents three major governance challenges:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic Monopoly over Semantic Power</strong>: Platforms control the visibility and weight of semantics through algorithms, acting as "semantic gatekeepers." Traditional media and academic institutions are marginalized, leading to a "cognitive flattening" in public discourse.</li>
                <li><strong>Positive Feedback Loops of Semantic Polarization</strong>: Algorithms favor high-emotion, high-controversy content, trapping users in "semantic echo chambers" and deepening societal cognitive divisions. Research shows that algorithmic recommendations increase political semantic polarization by 27% (Chen et al., 2023).</li>
                <li><strong>Erosion of Semantic Truthfulness</strong>: Generative AI makes "semantic forgery" the norm, rendering traditional fact-checking models ineffective. Users struggle to distinguish between "algorithm-generated" and "human-expressed" content, leading to a "crisis of semantic trust."</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Governance must shift from "content regulation" to "ecosystem regulation," establishing a <strong>multi-center semantic governance framework</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technology Layer</strong>: Promote research on algorithmic interpretability; establish "semantic traceability" mechanisms (e.g., blockchain annotation of training data sources); develop "semantic authenticity scoring" models to assist user judgment.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Layer</strong>: Build a "Digital Memory Archive" that collects diverse, decentralized historical texts, breaking algorithmic monopolies over collective memory.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Layer</strong>: Design "anti-feedback" mechanisms such as delayed recommendations, diversity weighting, and user semantic preference calibration to break positive feedback loops.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="article-section">
            <h2>IV. Future Outlook: Toward "Digital Semantics"</h2>
            <p>The complexity of the Digital Semantic Ecosystem calls for a new research paradigm. This paper proposes <strong>Digital Semantics</strong> as a potential new interdisciplinary field. It should integrate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Computational Linguistics</strong>: Studying how algorithms model and generate semantics;</li>
                <li><strong>Media Sociology</strong>: Analyzing the social construction of semantics on digital platforms;</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Science</strong>: Investigating how users perceive, remember, and respond to semantics;</li>
                <li><strong>Ethics and Governance</strong>: Designing semantically fair algorithms and institutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The core mission of Digital Semantics is to: <strong>reveal the evolutionary dynamics of meaning in digital ecosystems, and build interpretable, intervenable, and predictive semantic governance tools</strong>. Research pathways may include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Semantic Evolution Mapping</strong>: Using dynamic network models to track changes in semantic nodes (e.g., keywords) in terms of co-occurrence, sentiment, and influence;</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic Memory Audits</strong>: Quantifying the sources and distribution of semantic bias in training data, and assessing its impact on public cognition;</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Intervention Experiments</strong>: Testing the effects of different feedback mechanisms on semantic polarization in controlled environments;</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Modal Semantic Analysis</strong>: Integrating text, image, and video data to study the co-evolution of meaning across hybrid media.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Future research should focus on <em>semantic resilience</em>—the system's ability to resist semantic manipulation, polarization, and distortion. For example, how can "semantic vaccines" expose users to mild counterexamples in advance to enhance cognitive immunity (see van der Linden, 2023, on the "prebunking" theory)?</p>
            <p>Moreover, Digital Semantics must guard against the "technological determinism" trap. Semantic evolution is always the result of the interplay between technology, culture, institutions, and individual agency. Governance cannot rely solely on algorithmic optimization, but must rebuild a <em>semantic public sphere</em>—a digital space where diverse actors participate equally in semantic negotiation.</p>

        <section class="article-section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The Digital Semantic Ecosystem reveals a profound transformation of meaning in the algorithmic age: semantics is no longer passively expressed, but actively constructed; no longer a static symbol, but a dynamic process. The tripartite interaction of technology, memory, and feedback constitutes the core mechanism of semantic evolution. Governance must move beyond content censorship toward ecosystem regulation, establishing a multi-center, interpretable, and intervenable semantic governance system.</p>
            <p>More importantly, this research heralds the emergence of <em>Digital Semantics</em> as a new interdisciplinary field. It is not only a tool for technological critique, but a design guide for the cognitive infrastructure of future societies. In an era where algorithms increasingly serve as "cognitive intermediaries," we urgently need a science capable of understanding, guiding, and reshaping digital semantics. Only then can we, amidst the flood of meaning, safeguard the anchor of public reason and rebuild the web of significance in the digital age.</p>
