            <h2>Semantic Ambiguity: A Multidimensional Exploration from Neural Mechanisms to Cross-Cultural Communication</h2>
            <p>Semantic ambiguity, as an inherent characteristic of language understanding, is like an undercurrent hidden beneath clear lake water, constantly challenging the efficiency and precision of our communication. From cognitive science to computational linguistics and sociolinguistics, the study of semantic ambiguity reveals the complexity of language understanding and its profound impact in various fields. This article will delve into the multidimensional characteristics of semantic ambiguity and strategies to address it from three dimensions: neural mechanisms in the brain, the construction of computational linguistics models, and the impact in cross-cultural communication.</p>

            <h3>I. Cognitive Science Perspective: The Symphony of Neural Mechanisms</h3>
            <p>Semantic ambiguity is an inherent feature of natural language, akin to a meticulously designed maze that tests the decoding capabilities of cognitive systems. When we encounter a sentence like "He saw a dog and its shadow," the pronoun "its" can refer to either the dog or the shadow, and this lexical-level ambiguity requires contextual information to resolve. Cognitive science research shows that humans do not passively receive language input but actively construct meaning, a process that relies on complex cognitive mechanisms, including context integration, reasoning, and memory retrieval.</p>
            <p>When processing semantic ambiguity, the brain operates like a carefully orchestrated symphony, with various brain regions working together to construct meaning. The prefrontal cortex, like the conductor of the orchestra, regulates information integration and decision-making; the temporal lobe, especially the temporo-parietal junction, acts like the string section, responsible for lexical semantic representation; the parietal lobe, like the brass section, participates in spatial reasoning and conceptual integration. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that different brain regions exhibit dynamic changes in activation patterns when faced with ambiguous information. For example, during the resolution of lexical-level ambiguity, the activation levels of the temporal and prefrontal lobes significantly increase; in the interpretation of sentence-level ambiguity, the coordination between the parietal and prefrontal lobes is more pronounced.</p>
            <p>The processing of semantic ambiguity not only reflects the brain's decoding ability but also demonstrates the plasticity of the nervous system. As language experience accumulates, the brain forms more refined semantic networks, thereby improving the efficiency of ambiguity resolution. This neural plasticity is manifested at multiple levels, including the strengthening of neural connections, the reorganization of neuronal clusters, and the adjustment of synaptic plasticity. Cognitive training and language learning provide strong evidence for this plasticity. For instance, bilingual individuals exhibit unique characteristics in brain structure and function, making them better at handling semantic ambiguity, which may be related to the reinforcement of neural networks during language switching.</p>

            <h3>II. Computational Linguistics Perspective: Building Models for Automatic Recognition and Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity</h3>
            <p>Semantic ambiguity poses significant challenges in natural language processing (NLP) because computers struggle to accurately understand semantic ambiguity, which affects the performance of language processing tasks. To address this challenge, the field of computational linguistics is dedicated to building models for the automatic recognition and resolution of semantic ambiguity.</p>
            <p>The recognition of semantic ambiguity is the first step in handling it, with the primary goal of detecting potentially ambiguous expressions in text. Depending on the technical approach,
