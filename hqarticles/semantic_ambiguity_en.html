            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Semantic ambiguity, like an invisible river, flows at the intersection of language, cognition, and reality. It not only shapes our understanding of the world but also profoundly impacts the interaction between technology and society. As one of the key features of language, semantic ambiguity is not just about the vagueness of words; it is a product of the intertwining of human cognition and culture.</p>

            <h2>The Essence of Semantic Ambiguity: From Language to Cognition</h2>
            <p>Semantic ambiguity refers to the polysemy, uncertainty, and phenomena that cannot be precisely defined logically in language. For example, the concepts of "young" and "old" are relatively clear in core meaning, but when trying to draw a clear boundary between them, ambiguity arises. Different cultures, social backgrounds, and individual experiences all contribute to varying interpretations.</p>

            <h2>Semantic Ambiguity and Artificial Intelligence: Opportunities and Challenges</h2>
            <p>In the era of artificial intelligence, semantic ambiguity is not just a characteristic of language; it is also a significant barrier between machines and humans. While algorithms and models have made significant progress in handling structured data and precise instructions, semantic ambiguity remains a major challenge in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p>

            <h2>The Social Impact of Semantic Ambiguity: The Invisible Wings of the Butterfly Effect</h2>
            <p>Semantic ambiguity not only plays a role in the technical field but also acts like an invisible butterfly, triggering a series of连锁 reactions in society, culture, and politics. Ambiguous words in news headlines are a classic example.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Semantic ambiguity is both a characteristic of language and cognition. It allows us to maintain flexibility in complex realities while also introducing complexities in understanding and application. In the era of artificial intelligence, semantic ambiguity is not only a technical challenge but also an opportunity to drive AI systems towards greater intelligence and human-like qualities.</p>
