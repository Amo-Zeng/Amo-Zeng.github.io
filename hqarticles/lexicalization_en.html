            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In contemporary society, lexicalization is not only a dynamic process of language development but also a complex mirror of the intersection between technology, culture, and cognition. With the rapid advancement of technology, particularly in areas such as artificial intelligence, big data, and virtual reality, lexicalization has gained unprecedented vitality and depth. Simultaneously, cultural identity is expressed and reinforced through lexicalization, becoming a core symbol of different group's psychological structures and collective memories. More importantly, as a metaphoric mapping of cognitive structures, lexicalization profoundly reflects humanity's modes of perceiving and thinking about the world. This article will explore the multidimensional implications of lexicalization from the perspectives of the interplay between technology and humanity, the mirror of cultural identity, and the metaphoric mapping of cognitive structures, analyzing its profound impact on human society, culture, and modes of thinking.</p>

            <h2>The Interplay of Technology and Humanity: The Technological Drive of Lexicalization</h2>
            <p>The advancement of technology is one of the most significant driving forces behind lexicalization. With the continuous emergence of new technologies, a plethora of new terms have come into being, such as "metaverse," "deep learning," "cryptocurrency," etc. These terms are not just symbols of technology but also profound shifts in humanity's ways of understanding and perceiving the world.</p>
            <p>Take "metaverse" as an example. This concept originated in science fiction but has gradually transitioned from fiction to reality with the development of virtual reality and augmented reality technologies, becoming a foresight of future lifestyles. "Metaverse" not only challenges our understanding of the boundaries between the real and virtual worlds but also drives the emergence of new terms and concepts. For instance, terms like "virtual idol" and "digital twin" reflect how technology integrates the virtual with reality, further blurring their boundaries.</p>
            <p>However, the proliferation of technological terms also poses challenges to human ways of thinking. For example, the widespread use of the term "algorithm" has led people to rely more on data-driven and automated decision-making, neglecting human subjective judgment and emotional factors. Does the oversaturation of technological terms risk impoverishing language? This is a question worth pondering. On one hand, the richness of technological terms does indeed expand our expressive space; on the other hand, excessive reliance on technical jargon may lead to linguistic homogenization and monotony. Balancing technological progress with the preservation of linguistic diversity and richness is a delicate task.</p>

            <h2>The Mirror of Cultural Identity: The Cultural Expression of Lexicalization</h2>
            <p>Lexicalization is not merely a linguistic phenomenon but also a dynamic expression of cultural identity. The naming and interpretation of the same entity across different cultures often reflect distinct cultural logics and collective unconsciousness. For example, the symbolic meanings of "dragon" vary significantly between Chinese and Western cultures: in Chinese culture, "dragon" symbolizes authority and good fortune, while in Western culture, "dragon" (or "dragon") represents evil and destruction. This divergence stems not only from different mythological traditions but also reflects differing understandings of power and order between Eastern and Western cultures.</p>
            <p>Popular culture plays a crucial role in lexicalization, rapidly disseminating new terms through mass media and shaping new cultural identities. For instance, the popularity of terms like "otaku culture," "involution," and "lying flat" reflects contemporary Chinese youth's reflections on social realities and their self-positioning. These terms are not just linguistic phenomena but also symbols of social and cultural changes. Similarly, "Korean Wave" has shaped global perceptions and identifications of Korean culture through terms like "oppa" and "K-drama."</p>
            <p>However, the relationship between lexicalization and cultural identity is not unidirectional but a bidirectional interactive process. Lexicalization not only reflects the essence of cultural identity but also continuously reinforces and reshapes it through language use. For example, the rise of the term "guochao" (national trend) reflects contemporary Chinese youth's pride and identification with local culture. This cultural awakening is not only manifest in fashion trends but also profoundly influences people's modes of thinking and behavior.</p>

            <h2>The Metaphoric Mapping of Cognitive Structures: The Cognitive Dynamics of Lexicalization</h2>
            <p>Lexicalization is not merely an external manifestation of linguistic forms but also a metaphoric mapping of cognitive structures. From the perspective of metaphor, lexicalization is a process of simplifying and codifying complex cognitive structures. For instance, the term "internet" not only describes a technological means but also condenses numerous technical details and network structures, reflecting the compressibility of cognitive structures.</p>
            <p>The lexical system mirrors the hierarchical and relational aspects of cognitive structures. For example, the sequence from "artificial intelligence" to "machine learning" to "deep learning" reflects an epistemological progression from concrete to abstract. Additionally, the semantic relationships between terms reflect the web-like characteristics of cognitive structures. For instance, the terms "cryptocurrency" and "blockchain" share core concepts while showcasing the multidimensional and unified nature of cognitive structures.</p>
            <p>However, as a metaphor of cognitive structures, lexicalization inevitably introduces certain cognitive biases. For example, for ease of memory and usage, lexicalization often omits certain details, leading to a tendency towards simplification of cognitive structures. Furthermore, lexicalization in different cultural contexts emphasizes varying cognitive dimensions, reflecting the subjective and relative nature of cognitive structures.</p>
            <p>Lexicalization is not only a representation of cognitive structures but also a driving force for cognitive development. The creation of new terms and the reinterpretation of old ones propel the evolution of cognitive structures. For example, the popularity of the term "metaverse" not only reflects humanity's exploration of the virtual world but also promotes interdisciplinary thinking. Through lexicalization, human cognitive achievements are passed down through generations, driving the progress of civilization.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: The Multidimensional Nature of Lexicalization and Future Possibilities</h2>
            <p>Lexicalization, as the interplay of technology and humanity, the mirror of cultural identity, and the metaphoric mapping of cognitive structures, deeply reflects the intricate relationships between language and thought, culture and cognition. The technological impetus has infused lexicalization with new vitality but also poses risks of linguistic homogenization; cultural identity is expressed and reinforced through lexicalization, becoming a core symbol for different groups; and the metaphoric mapping of cognitive structures underscores the pivotal role of lexicalization in human modes of thinking.</p>
            <p>In the future, lexicalization will continue to play a crucial role across the multiple dimensions of technology, culture, and cognition. How can we maintain linguistic diversity alongside technological progress? How can lexicalization facilitate cross-cultural communication and integration? How can we leverage lexicalization to advance the innovation and development of cognitive structures? These questions are not only relevant to linguistics but also to the future trajectory of human society, culture, and thought. By delving into the multidimensional nature of lexicalization, we can better understand this phenomenon and find balanced and innovative pathways amidst the intersections of technology, culture, and cognition.</p>
