            <h2>Coordination Bonds: From Static to Dynamic, Bridging Inorganic and Organic Chemistry</h2>
            <p>Coordination bonds, as a unique type of chemical bond, not only hold a significant position in traditional chemical theory but also demonstrate their dynamic properties and cross-disciplinary application potential in modern chemical research. This article will delve into the nature of coordination bonds, their applications in inorganic and organic chemistry, and how they facilitate the integration between these two fields, while also looking ahead to their future prospects.</p>
