            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), semantic feature analysis is a key tool for uncovering the deep meanings of language. However, as technology advances and socio-cultural changes rapidly occur, traditional static semantic analysis methods are gradually showing their limitations. This reality prompts researchers to seek breakthroughs beyond existing frameworks, exploring new possibilities for language understanding through the paths of personalization and dynamism. Personalized semantic feature analysis focuses on inter-individual differences, while dynamic semantic feature evolution emphasizes the changes in language over time and context. This article aims to combine these two perspectives, exploring how the integration of personalized and dynamic semantic features can open new avenues for language understanding and AI applications.</p>

            <h2>Interaction Between Personalized and Dynamic Semantic Features</h2>
            <p>Personalized semantic feature analysis focuses on the unique backgrounds and preferences of individuals, while dynamic semantic feature evolution looks at the changes of language over time and context. These two aspects complement each other on multiple levels:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cultural and Linguistic Diversity:</strong> Personalized analysis emphasizes regional and cultural differences, while dynamic semantic evolution focuses on semantic changes brought about by cross-cultural communication. Understanding these differences helps capture subtle language changes over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotions and Psychological States:</strong> Personalized analysis pays attention to the immediate impact of emotions, while dynamic evolution focuses on the long-term emotional changes. Combining both allows for a more accurate understanding of emotional shifts in users' language.</li>
                <li><strong>Context and Dependency:</strong> Context adaptation in personalized analysis and context changes in dynamic evolution resonate with each other, collectively promoting the construction from static vocabularies to dynamic semantic networks.</li>
            </ul>
