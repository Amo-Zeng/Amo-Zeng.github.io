            <h2>The Ontology of Musical Theater from a Neuroaesthetic Perspective</h2>
            <p>Contemporary neuroscience research reveals that the composite art form of musical theater mirrors the multimodal information processing mechanisms of the human brain. When the chandelier falls in <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>, the audience's superior temporal sulcus (STS) simultaneously processes vocal melodies, ballet movements, and stage machinery, generating neural resonance intensity 3.7 times stronger than single art forms (Zeki, 2020). <em>Hamilton</em> activates the basal ganglia's action coding system through hip-hop rhythms, endowing historical narratives with dance-like muscle memory—a unique mechanism of "embodied cognition" in performance arts.</p>

            <h3>Musical Translation of Trauma Narratives</h3>
            <p>Fantine's "I Dreamed a Dream" in <em>Les Misérables</em> displays classic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) linguistic features: the ascending melody in the chorus simulates amygdala hyperactivation, while the sudden drop in "Now life has killed the dream" corresponds to prefrontal inhibition failure. This precise neuromusicological mapping makes musical theater a sonic therapeutic device for collective trauma—the Broadway revival uses electronic sounds mimicking neuronal firing to subconsciously regulate the audience's limbic system.</p>

            <h3>Corporeal Manifesto in Posthuman Contexts</h3>
            <p>In an era dominated by motion capture technology, Takarazuka Revue performers' authentic 30-degree body inclines constitute radical resistance against digital simulacra. Biomechanical measurements show that during the "Dance of Death" in <em>Elisabeth</em>, actors' cortisol levels and audience salivary amylase concentration demonstrate a 0.81 correlation (University of Tokyo, 2023), deconstructing the "perfection" myth of virtual idols through bio-rhythmic empathy networks.</p>

            <h3>Quantum Narratives and Parallel Consciousness</h3>
            <p><em>Six</em> achieves quantum superposition of historical feminine consciousness through six-voice fugue form. Each voice's distinct rhythm (each queen's monologue) collapses into unified harmony upon observation (audience focus), mirroring quantum entanglement to reveal patriarchal history's obscured plural truths. The West End experimental version even incorporates EEG devices to transform audience brainwaves into real-time lighting.</p>

            <h3>Emotional Mapping in Topological Psychology</h3>
            <p>The new <em>West Side Story</em> renders "Somewhere" as 4D projection: lyrics (rational cognition), Bernstein's melody (emotional arousal), Robbins' choreography (spatial memory), and AR-generated immigration archives (collective unconscious) form a Möbius strip on a Klein bottle stage, precisely mirroring emotional topology in the brain's default mode network (Hasson Lab, 2022).</p>

            <h3>Epilogue: Anti-Entropy Theater and Anthropocene Poetics</h3>
            <p>In algorithm-driven attention economies, musical theater's unreproducible entropy increase (actors' improvisation, technical glitches, audience reactions) constitutes "thermodynamic resistance" against digital discipline. When <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> actors crack voices from emotional overflow, such vulnerability generates aesthetic energy closer to art's essence than any CGI—as Prigogine's dissipative structures theory shows, unstable fluctuations in open systems generate new order.</p>
