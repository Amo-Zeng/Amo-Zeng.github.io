            <h3>1. The Dual Challenges of Hydropower: Ecological Impact and Resource Management</h3>
            <p>The core element of hydropower is "water," yet this element's double-edged effect is particularly evident in water resource management. The construction and operation of hydropower stations, like setting up "gates" on rivers, have profound impacts on river ecosystems.</p>
            <h4>1.1 The "Hydropower Footprint" on River Ecology</h4>
            <p>Hydropower stations regulate the storage and release of water in reservoirs, artificially altering the natural flow of rivers. While this can mitigate flood disasters and ensure downstream water security, it also disrupts the original hydrological cycles of rivers, leading to the loss of downstream aquatic habitats, reduced species diversity, and even ecosystem collapse. Additionally, the depth and area of reservoir water change the temperature stratification of water bodies, resulting in higher or lower downstream water temperatures, affecting the survival and reproduction of aquatic organisms. For example, temperature increases may cause fish to spawn earlier, disrupting the original ecological balance.</p>
            <h4>1.2 Balancing Energy Demand and Ecological Protection</h4>
            <p>Addressing the challenges posed by hydropower to river ecosystems, how to balance energy demand and ecological protection, and achieve sustainable water resource utilization, has become an urgent issue. Measures such as ecological flow release, fishway construction and ecological restoration, and green hydropower certification have become important means to achieve this balance. By scientifically calculating and reasonably arranging, ensuring that rivers maintain a certain ecological flow during different seasons and periods, providing necessary living environments for aquatic organisms. Additionally, fishways and other facilities are reserved during the construction of hydropower stations to help fish migrate and spawn; damaged ecosystems are repaired and rebuilt to restore the ecological functions of rivers. Introducing internationally recognized green hydropower certification systems to assess and certify the environmental impacts of hydropower stations, promoting green and sustainable development of hydropower stations.</p>
            <h4>1.3 "Virtual Water" and Water Rights Trading</h4>
            <p>The concept of "virtual water" provides new insights for water resource management. In the field of hydropower, the application of "virtual water" is mainly reflected in water rights trading and optimal allocation of water resources. By establishing a water rights trading market, the use rights of water resources are market-oriented to improve water resource utilization efficiency, providing new water source guarantees for hydropower projects. Utilizing modern information technology to build a basin water resource management platform, optimizing the allocation of water resources between different regions and uses, ensuring the coordinated development of hydropower with agricultural irrigation, urban water supply, and other water needs.</p>

            <h4>2.1 "Water-Wind-Solar" Complementary Energy System</h4>
            <p>Hydropower is not an "island" but can "marry" with other renewable energies such as wind and solar, building a powerful "water-wind-solar" complementary energy system. Solar and wind energy are influenced by natural conditions, characterized by intermittency and volatility, while hydropower has the ability to respond quickly. Hydropower can act like a "master of regulation," reducing output during wind and solar power peaks and increasing output during lows, smoothing grid fluctuations, enhancing the uptake of renewable energy, ultimately achieving a synergistic effect of 1+1+1>3.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Deep Exploration in Energy Storage</h4>
            <p>Hydropower also shows great potential in the energy storage field, no longer just a "generate-and-use" power generation mode. Large reservoirs can act like giant "energy warehouses," storing water and generating power during the wet season, and releasing stored energy during the dry season, achieving seasonal energy storage. This "cross-seasonal energy storage" capability can effectively solve the instability problem of renewable energy generation, providing strong support for building a more stable and reliable energy system.</p>
            <h4>2.3 Promotion and Application of Small Hydropower Stations</h4>
            <p>The "awakening" of hydropower is also reflected in its trend of technological下沉. Small hydropower technology, especially the development of micro-hydropower stations, brings new hope to remote areas. These "small but beautiful" hydropower stations do not require massive infrastructure and can be flexibly deployed in rivers, streams, and other environments, providing clean and reliable electricity to remote areas, contributing to rural revitalization and sustainable development.</p>
