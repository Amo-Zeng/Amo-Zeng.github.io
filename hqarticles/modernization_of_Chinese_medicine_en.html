            <h2>Technological Integration</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of technology, the combination of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and modern technology has become an irreversible trend. This integration is not merely a technical amalgamation but also a deepening and expansion of TCM theory and practice. Through the application of modern information technology, such as big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, the inheritance and development of TCM have gained new platforms. For example, artificial intelligence algorithms analyzing TCM pulse diagnosis data have improved diagnostic accuracy, while the establishment of a TCM knowledge graph has enabled structured and visualized knowledge, facilitating research and clinical application.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Educational Innovation</h2>
            <p>In terms of educational innovation, TCM education is undergoing a profound transformation. The application of digital teaching resources, such as virtual reality technology, provides an intuitive and interactive learning experience. The implementation of interdisciplinary teaching, combined with modern scientific knowledge, helps students build a comprehensive knowledge base. The strengthening of practical teaching and the promotion of a culture of lifelong learning ensure that students can apply what they have learned in real medical environments and continuously update their knowledge and skills.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>International Pathways</h2>
            <p>In the context of globalization, the internationalization of TCM is not only a challenge but also a historic opportunity. Establishing quality control and certification systems in line with international standards, as well as the internationalization of TCM theory, are key to achieving modernization of TCM. Through international academic exchanges, cultural exhibitions, and educational training, the profound cultural heritage and unique therapeutic concepts of TCM are disseminated. International cooperation promotes resource sharing and collaborative research, enhancing the global influence of TCM.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Challenges and Prospects</h2>
            <p>However, the combination of TCM and modern technology also faces challenges, such as how to maintain the essential characteristics of TCM, avoid over-reliance on modern technology at the expense of traditional wisdom, and address the standardization and internationalization of TCM. Nevertheless, with continuous technological advancements and the deep implementation of innovative teaching concepts, TCM education will become more international and modernized, cultivating more outstanding TCM professionals who can promote human health endeavors.</p>
