            <h2>The May Fourth Movement and Contemporary Youth Identity</h2>
            <p>The May Fourth Movement, as a landmark patriotic movement and cultural enlightenment in Chinese history, not only profoundly influenced China's social structure and cultural development through its strong nationalist sentiment and extensive social mobilization, but also shaped an identity among youth characterized by the courage to pursue truth and drive innovation. The core spirit of this movement continues to inspire contemporary youth in constructing new individual identities amidst the collision of diverse values and complex identity confusion in today's globalized, informatized, and networked era.</p>

            <h3>Youth Vanguard of the May Fourth Movement and Cultural Nationalism</h3>
            <p>During the May Fourth Movement, youth emerged as vanguards and main forces, profoundly impacting all levels of society through active social participation and ideological liberation. Their patriotic sentiments and aspirations for national independence coalesced into a powerful social force. This spirit not only promoted ideological liberation and cultural enlightenment at the time but also set an example for subsequent generations of youth. However, the cultural nationalism of the May Fourth Movement also revealed its complexities and contradictions. Some intellectuals' blind worship of Western culture and extreme rejection of traditional culture, while facilitating ideological liberation to some extent, also triggered a crisis of cultural identity. This binary mode of thinking led to a rupture in cultural continuity as they failed to rationally distinguish between the essence and dross of traditional culture while criticizing feudal ideologies.</p>

            <h3>Contemporary Cultural Confidence and Youth Identity Formation</h3>
            <p>Compared to the extreme cultural nationalism of the May Fourth period, contemporary China's "cultural confidence" initiative demonstrates a more rational, inclusive, and innovative approach. In the context of globalization, China must not only face cultural and economic challenges from the West but also find its cultural positioning amidst multicultural convergence. Building cultural confidence involves both re-examining traditional values and rationally drawing upon Western culture. Contemporary youth are gradually forming a development path with Chinese characteristics by rationally absorbing beneficial elements of Western culture while integrating local traditions. This balanced approach avoids both cultural inferiority and cultural arrogance. However, how contemporary youth can inherit the May Fourth Spirit and construct individual identities suited to modern characteristics amid identity confusion and challenges posed by globalization, informatization, and networking remains a significant practical issue. Globalization and informatization have created profound interactions in economic, cultural, and ideological spheres, resulting in complex multiple identities that lead to confusion in self-identification and belonging. Information fragmentation, disinformation, and conflicts between virtual and real-world identities may exacerbate this identity confusion.</p>

            <h3>Pathways to Inherit the May Fourth Spirit and Construct Individual Identity</h3>
            <p>Facing these challenges, contemporary youth can draw strength from the May Fourth Spirit and construct individual identity through the following pathways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Combining Patriotism with Global Perspective</strong>: While patriotism remains the core of the May Fourth Spirit, contemporary youth should transform it into practical actions and rational thinking rather than mere emotional expression. In the global context, patriotism should be open and inclusive, combined with a global perspective. Youth should actively participate in international exchanges, deeply understand the strengths and weaknesses of different cultures and systems, and through comparison and learning, strengthen their national identity while recognizing their responsibilities as global citizens.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultivating Critical Thinking</strong>: The democratic and scientific spirit advocated by the May Fourth Movement offers guidance for youth's cognitive development. Facing information overload and disinformation, youth should develop independent thinking and critical analysis skills to avoid being swayed by superficial information. They should learn to deeply analyze and judge different viewpoints, forming their own value systems. Through reading classics, academic discussions, and practical activities, youth can enhance their reasoning abilities and cultural literacy, thereby establishing clear individual identities amidst diverse values.</li>
                <li><strong>Active Social Participation</strong>: May Fourth youth achieved self-identification through concrete social reforms. Contemporary youth can learn from this approach by participating in public welfare, community service, and volunteer activities to translate ideals into practice. Such actions not only strengthen social responsibility but also help validate identity through real-world experiences. For instance, participating in environmental protection or educational poverty alleviation allows youth to experience the power of collective action while discovering personal values and belonging.</li>
                <li><strong>Focusing on Mental Health and Relationship Building</strong>: In the digital age, youth face conflicts between virtual and real identities, requiring psychological counseling and group activities to balance these dimensions. Regular participation in mental health services and group activities helps youth better understand their psychological needs and build resilience. Meanwhile, establishing strong interpersonal relationships and support networks can alleviate identity pressure and enhance social belonging in real life.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Conclusion and Outlook</h3>
            <p>The May Fourth Movement, with its powerful spiritual force, shaped an identity characterized by truth-seeking and innovative transformation. By inheriting this spirit while combining patriotism with global perspectives, cultivating critical thinking, engaging in social practice, and focusing on mental health, contemporary youth can effectively navigate identity confusion in the era of globalization and informatization, constructing individual identities suited to modern characteristics. This benefits both personal growth and societal progress. Future research should further explore youth identity construction mechanisms in multicultural contexts, guiding them to become modern citizens with international vision and critical thinking, jointly promoting social harmony and advancement.</p>
