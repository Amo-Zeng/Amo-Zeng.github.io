## From Toes to Digital: Cultural Identity and Modern Transformation of Russian Ballet

Russian ballet, as a radiant pearl that embodies the soul and emotions of the Russian nation, has undergone profound transformations in its four-century development, shifting from the exclusive domain of the nobility to the masses, and from mechanical replication to digital rebirth. This art form has not only continuously innovated in techniques and performance styles but has also achieved a phoenix-like rebirth in the reconstruction of its cultural identity. From a post-colonial perspective, the modern transformation of Russian ballet represents not just an artistic innovation but also a multifaceted reconstruction of cultural identity and an expansion of global influence.

## 一、 Cultural Identity Disruption: From "Other" to National Awakening

In the 18th century, driven by Peter the Great's reforms, Russia was eager to find a way to join the center of European civilization. Ballet, as an integral part of European court culture at the time, was introduced into Russia and became the exclusive entertainment of the aristocracy. However, this cultural import was not an equal exchange but a cultural export with a European-centered mindset. French and Italian ballet masters brought their techniques and aesthetic standards, along with a dismissive and prejudiced view of Russian culture.

Initially, Russian ballet's choreography, music, and movements almost entirely followed European models, lacking indigenous characteristics. During this period, Russian ballet, as described in post-colonial theory, was an "Other" dominated by European culture, unable to establish its own cultural identity.

## 二、 Reconstruction of Cultural Identity: From National Consciousness to Global Integration

The 19th century was an era of national consciousness awakening in Russia, and a crucial period for the artistic innovation of Russian ballet. Artists such as Tchaikovsky and Petipa began integrating Russian national music, literature, and theatrical elements into ballet creation. The birth of "Swan Lake" marked a breakthrough in the nationalization exploration of Russian ballet. This work not only incorporated elements of Russian folk music in its music but also showcased Russian national spirit in its content, becoming a milestone in the reconstruction of Russian ballet's cultural identity.

Entering the 20th century, with the deepening of globalization, the cultural identity of Russian ballet further diversified. From a post-colonial perspective, Russian ballet was no longer a single cultural entity but a highly charged cultural field. In this field, elements such as "Europe" and "the East," "tradition" and "modernity," "highbrow" and "popular" collided, merged, and reconstructed, forming a unique cultural identity. For example, the modern ballet production "Carmen" fused elements of Spanish bullfighting with Chinese Peking opera, showcasing cross-cultural innovation and integration.

## 三、 From Mechanical Replication to Digital Rebirth: Technological Innovation and Artistic Dissemination

In the digital age, the inheritance and innovation of Russian ballet have embraced new opportunities. From the era of mechanical replication and image preservation to the era of digital rebirth and virtual performance, technological advancements have provided limitless possibilities for the dissemination and innovation of ballet art.

### 1. Immersive Experience:

The application of VR technology allows audiences to experience the charm of ballet performances firsthand. By wearing VR equipment, viewers can enjoy 360-degree panoramic views of dancers' graceful movements, appreciate the elaborate stage settings, and even "walk" behind the scenes to observe the rehearsal process up close. This immersive experience breaks the limitations of traditional theater spaces, offering more people the opportunity to appreciate the allure of ballet art.

### 2. Digital Performance:

The use of AI technology makes digital performances of ballet possible. Through motion capture and data analysis, AI can simulate dancers' movements and combine them with virtual characters to create entirely new ballet productions. This digital performance approach not only allows for the recreation of classic works but also enables the telling of new stories, injecting fresh vitality into ballet art.

### 3. Cross-Cultural Fusion:

The development of digital technology has provided new opportunities for the cross-cultural fusion of ballet art. Through digital platforms, ballet troupes from different countries and regions can engage in online exchanges and collaborations, co-creating ballet productions that blend diverse cultural elements. This cross-cultural fusion not only enriches the forms of ballet art but also fosters communication and understanding between different cultures.

## 四、 From Noble Exclusive to Street Culture: Artistic Revolution and Popular Dissemination

The modern transformation of Russian ballet is reflected not only in technological advancements but also in the changes in its dissemination methods and societal influence. From an art form exclusive to the nobility to a fusion with street culture, Russian ballet has undergone a metamorphosis from the "highbrow hall" to "street culture."

During the Soviet era, the government promoted the popularization of ballet, establishing national ballet schools to train dancers from working-class and peasant backgrounds, bringing ballet art truly into the homes of ordinary people. This transformation not only expanded the audience base for ballet but also promoted the popularization and innovation of the art form. For example, Soviet-era ballet productions like "The Diamond Factory," based on real-life subjects, told the stories of workers and showcased the social concerns of ballet art.

With the advancement of digital technology, the dissemination of ballet art has become further democratized. Countless ballet tutorial videos, classic performance clips, and innovative works circulate online, allowing anyone to learn ballet movements and experience its charm through their phone screens. On YouTube, Russian ballet stars' channels have millions of subscribers, with their daily training sessions and live performances attracting audiences worldwide.

Meanwhile, the fusion of ballet with other popular cultures has given rise to new art forms. In the streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg, artists perform flash mobs and improvisational dances, integrating ballet elements into modern dance, street dance, and even rap. This cross-genre fusion not only expands ballet's audience but also creates new artistic expressions.

## 五、 Towards a Future of Multicultural Identity

From a post-colonial perspective, the modern transformation of Russian ballet is not just about the inheritance and innovation of traditional art but also a multifaceted reconstruction of cultural identity. On its future path, Russian ballet will continue to uphold an open and inclusive attitude, exploring new artistic expressions through the exchange and integration of diverse cultures, creating a more vibrant and colorful artistic world.

The modern transformation of Russian ballet not only provides valuable experience for the inheritance and innovation of traditional arts but also makes significant contributions to the development of global cultural diversity. In the context of globalization, Russian ballet, with its unique cultural identity and artistic charm, continues to shine on the world stage.
