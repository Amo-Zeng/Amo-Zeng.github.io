            <h2>The Evolution of Internet Economy</h2>
            <p>The development of the Internet economy, from the early reliance on traffic harvesting for crude growth, has gradually shifted towards value-driven, refined operations. This transformation is undergoing a profound change. Behind this transformation lies the symbiotic rule constituted by data, platforms, and algorithms, playing a crucial role. These three elements depend on each other and coordinate to shape the operational logic of the Internet economy, driving it from a single traffic-driven model to an ecosystem of co-creation, ultimately achieving high-quality and sustainable development.</p>

            <h3>I. Data: The Cornerstone of Internet Economy</h3>
            <p>Data is the foundation of the Internet economy, as important as land in agricultural societies, serving as the basis for all economic activities. However, unlike traditional land resources, the "data soil" of the Internet era is infinitely renewable and inclusive. It not only records users' behavioral habits and consumption preferences but also bears the knowledge, experience, and wisdom of the entire society. With the rise of big data technology, the ability to process and analyze massive amounts of data has significantly improved, providing continuous impetus for enterprise decision-making and platform optimization.</p>
            <p>In the Internet economy, data is no longer a static resource but dynamic energy. Through data mining and analysis, platforms can accurately predict user needs, optimize service experiences, and even reshape business models. For example, e-commerce platforms can accurately recommend products by analyzing consumer data, thereby boosting sales. Food delivery platforms use location data to optimize delivery routes, improving efficiency. Bike-sharing platforms integrate user骑行 data to better plan vehicle deployment and enhance user satisfaction. Deep utilization of data has become one of the core competitive advantages in the Internet economy.</p>

            <h3>II. Platforms: The Ecological Carrier of Internet Economy</h3>
            <p>Platforms are not only the carriers of the Internet economy but also vibrant ecosystems. They connect users, businesses, and service providers, building a multi-win ecosystem. In this ecosystem, platforms act as "infrastructure providers," offering technical support, resource sharing, and interactive spaces for various participants, reducing transaction costs and facilitating optimal resource allocation.</p>
            <p>The rise of platforms has broken traditional industry boundaries, driving cross-industry integration and innovation. For example, the emergence of e-commerce platforms has not only transformed product distribution methods but also spawned emerging industries such as logistics and payments. The rise of social media platforms has reshaped connections between people and driven changes in content creation and advertising. The ecological development of platforms has enabled the growth of the Internet economy to no longer rely on a single resource or market but through multi-party collaboration, forming a more stable and sustainable community of interest.</p>

            <h3>III. Algorithms: The Invisible Scepter of Internet Economy</h3>
            <p>With the deepening development of the Internet economy, algorithms have become a significant driving force in its operation. Algorithms are not only tools for data analysis but also intangible scepters in the platform ecosystem, dictating resource allocation, user decisions, and the formulation of social rules. In the Internet economy, the ruling characteristics of algorithms have become increasingly prominent: precise product recommendations, intelligent content distribution, financial services risk control models, all directly reflect algorithmic decisions.</p>
            <p>However, the expansion of algorithmic power has also brought profound ethical dilemmas. When algorithms start to dominate personal credit assessments, job opportunity distribution, and even public opinion direction, their influence has transcended the scope of technical tools. This power expansion has disrupted traditional power distribution patterns and reshaped social governance models. For instance, Apple's App Store algorithms have changed app distribution modes, Google's search algorithms influence information access, and Facebook's social algorithms shape how people connect. These seemingly neutral technical decisions are redefining market rules.</p>

            <h3>IV. From Traffic Harvesting to Value Creation: The Transformation of Internet Economy</h3>
            <p>The early development of the Internet economy relied on traffic harvesting. Platforms attracted users' attention and traffic, then monetized it through advertising, e-commerce, and other models, completing the transformation from traffic to profit. However, as traffic dividends gradually disappeared, customer acquisition costs continued to rise, making the traffic harvesting model unsustainable. Internet platforms have realized that shifting focus to value creation is essential for sustainable development.</p>
            <p>Value creation means platforms must create genuine value for users, partners, and society, rather than pursuing short-term interests. Specifically, value creation is reflected in the following aspects:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Deeply understanding user needs to provide high-quality products and services:</strong> Platforms need to thoroughly understand user needs, develop products and services accordingly, continuously enhance user experiences, and build trust and loyalty.</li>
                <li><strong>Building a healthy and sustainable business model:</strong> Platforms need to explore diverse and sustainable business models such as membership services, content payment, knowledge payment, and enterprise services, moving away from ove
