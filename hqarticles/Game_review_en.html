            <h2>The Dual Aspects of Game Censorship: Cultural Identity, Algorithmic Regulation, and Power Restructuring</h2>
            <p>In the wave of globalization and digitization, games, as a cultural product, have seen their influence grow increasingly prominent. However, with the rise of games, game censorship systems have also become a global focus. Game censorship is not only about protecting cultural identity but also involves the application of algorithms and the restructuring of power relations. This article will explore the multiple dimensions of game censorship and its profound impact from the perspectives of cultural identity, algorithmic regulation, and power dynamics, and propose potential reform paths for the future.</p>

            <h3>I. Game Censorship and Cultural Identity: The Game Under Globalization</h3>
            <p>As a carrier of cultural output, games carry the cultural values of different countries and regions. Under the context of globalization, game censorship systems have become a focal point of the game between cultural output and local protection. This game not only reflects the deep-seated concerns of various countries about cultural identity but also reveals the challenges and opportunities faced by cultural diversity in the era of globalization.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strengthening and Rigidification of Cultural Identity:</strong> Through censorship, the core values of local culture are strengthened, but strict censorship systems may limit the innovation and diversity of games.</li>
                <li><strong>Balancing Cultural Output and Local Protection:</strong> In the context of globalization, games have a strong ability to output culture, but at the same time, there is a need to protect local culture from the influence of foreign cultures.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Game Censorship and Algorithmic Regulation: The Double-Edged Sword of AI</h3>
            <p>With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, AI's application in game content censorship has become increasingly widespread. AI is hailed as a tool to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of censorship, yet in practice, AI is like a double-edged sword, bringing both opportunities and challenges.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advantages and Limitations of AI:</strong> AI can scan massive amounts of data at an astonishing speed, but it lacks the deep understanding of culture, emotion, and context that humans possess, which may lead to misjudgment and over-censorship.</li>
                <li><strong>The Necessity of Human-Machine Collaboration:</strong> Future game content censorship should adopt a human-machine collaboration model, with AI handling repetitive tasks and human censors dealing with complex cases.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>III. Game Censorship and Power Restructuring: The Dilemma of Digital Labor</h3>
            <p>The game censorship system not only affects cultural identity and algorithmic regulation but also profoundly restructures the power relations within the game industry chain. In this power game, players, developers, and censors are placed in a complex dynamic triangular relationship.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Developers' Creative Freedom and Market Survival:</strong> Censorship systems limit developers' creative freedom, increase compliance costs, and may lead to the homogenization of game content.</li>
                <li><strong>Players' Voices: Overlooked Consumer Rights:</strong> Players' voices are often marginalized in the censorship process, with censorship systems more focused on social ethics and legal regulations.</li>
            </ul>
