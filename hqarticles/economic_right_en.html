            <h2>Reconstruction of Economic Rights in the Digital Age: From Identity to Global Equity, and Challenges of AI Ethics</h2>
            <p>Under the wave of digital technology, economic rights are undergoing unprecedented reconstruction. This transformation is not only driven by technological advancements but is also a complex product of globalization, regional differences, and the ethical implications of artificial intelligence. The rise of digital identity has redefined the manifestation of economic rights; the regional differences in economic rights during the globalization process highlight the challenges of international coordination; and the rise of artificial intelligence brings new ethical issues. This article will delve into how these three transformations intertwine to influence the reconstruction of economic rights and seek to balance fairness and development in this process.</p>

            <h3>1. Digital Identity: Digital Mapping and Reconstruction of Economic Rights</h3>
            <p>The rise of digital identity signifies the extension of economic rights from traditional physical credentials (such as ID cards, bank accounts) to the digital world. Digital fragments such as social media accounts, online shopping records, and health data together weave a new identity form, carrying our economic rights in the digital age. This change not only alters the manifestation of rights but also profoundly reshapes the way rights are realized.</p>
            <h4>1.1 The Rise of Digital Assets: A New Carrier of Economic Rights</h4>
            <p>In the digital asset field, such as the application of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), creators can directly prove the unique ownership of their works through blockchain technology, breaking the limitations of traditional intellectual property. Similarly, the rise of cryptocurrencies challenges the boundaries of the traditional financial system, fundamentally changing the way personal property rights are realized. However, this transformation also brings new challenges, especially in defining data privacy and property rights.</p>
            <h4>1.2 Challenges of Data Privacy and Property Rights</h4>
            <p>In the digital age, every online behavior may be recorded, analyzed, and even traded, making personal data a new type of property. However, how to define and protect data property rights? This issue is not only related to the realization of economic rights but also touches on the core values of modern society. For example, should users have complete control over their data? What role should tech companies and governments play in this transformation? These are pressing questions that need to be addressed.</p>
            <h4>1.3 Balancing Regulation and Innovation</h4>
            <p>The rise of digital identity makes traditional regulatory frameworks seem inadequate. Tech companies are both disruptors of rules and guardians of rights in this transformation. Finding a balance between technological innovation and the protection of economic rights has become the core issue in exploring economic rights in the digital age. For example, can decentralized technologies achieve fairer data governance? These questions require the joint participation of policymakers, tech companies, and the public.</p>

            <h3>2. Globalization and Regional Differences in Economic Rights: Conflicts and Coordination</h3>
            <p>The acceleration of globalization has promoted the global flow of resources, capital, technology, and labor but has also intensified regional differences in economic rights. The differences in demands between developed and developing countries regarding labor rights, intellectual property protection, and environmental protection have become important factors hindering global economic coordination and social equity.</p>
            <h4>2.1 Labor Rights: The Gamble Between Fairness and Efficiency</h4>
            <p>Developed countries tend to promote high-standard labor regulations globally to protect workers' basic rights; while developing countries are more concerned with economic development and job opportunities, considering low labor costs as an important means to attract foreign investment and promote economic growth. This divergence has made the coordination of labor rights in the globalization process difficult, especially when multinational companies face dilemmas in choosing production bases.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Intellectual Property Protection: The Dilemma Between Innovation and Development</h4>
            <p>Developed countries, leading in technology and innovation, tend to emphasize high-level intellectual property protection; while developing countries hope for greater flexibility in intellectual property protection to balance technology introduction and independent innovation. This difference continues to intensify, becoming an important source of international trade disputes.</p>
            <h4>2.3 Environmental Protection: Challenges of Sustainable Development</h4>
            <p>Developed countries propose higher environmental governance standards, while developing countries struggle between economic development and insufficient environmental governance capabilities. The global focus on climate change further intensifies the divergence between developed and developing countries in emission reduction responsibilities and economic compensation, making global environmental governance stagnant.</p>
            <p>Multinational companies play a crucial role in this transformation, needing to balance the pursuit of profit maximization with the economic rights demands of different regions. However, the phenomenon of "race to the bottom" is common, posing a severe challenge to the sustainable development of the global economy. The international community needs to explore paths to avoid the "race to the bottom" through multi-level cooperation and coordination, establishing a more fair and reasonable global economic order.</p>

            <h3>3. Artificial Intelligence: Ethical Challenges and Protection of Economic Rights</h3>
            <p>The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology not only demonstrates powerful potential in areas such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing but also reshapes the boundaries of economic rights imperceptibly, bringing a series of ethical challenges.</p>
            <h4>3.1 Algorithmic Discrimination: The Subtle Erosion of Economic Rights</h4>
            <p>The core of AI lies in data-driven and algorithmic decision-making. However, when these algorithms are based on biased data or their design itself has flaws, **algorithmic discrimination** may occur silently. This discrimination has far-reaching effects in employment, finance, and the provision of goods and services. For example, AI systems may exclude certain groups in the hiring process based on historical data biases or impose higher loan interest rates or deny loan applications in the financial sector for specific communities.</p>
            <h4>3.2 Impact on the Labor Market: Redefining Economic Rights</h4>
            <p>AI technology enhances production efficiency and creates new economic growth points but also inevitably replaces many traditional jobs, raising concerns about workers' economic rights. To address this challenge, retraining and skill enhancement programs, the improvement of social security systems, and the update of labor laws are necessary measures.</p>
            <h4>3.3 Ethical Framework of AI: The Umbrella of Economic Rights Protection</h4>
            <p>Establishing a clear ethical framework is key to addressing AI ethical challenges. This framework needs to not only regulate the development and application of AI technology but also ensure that it does not infringe on individual economic rights. Transparent algorithmic decision-making mechanisms, principles of fairness and inclusiveness, and the protection of privacy and data rights are the core elements of this framework.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In the digital age, the reconstruction of economic rights is not only a product of technology but also the result of the intertwining of globalization, regional differences, and AI ethics. The rise of digital identity maps the digital transformation of economic rights; regional differences in economic rights during the globalization process reveal the complexity of international coordination; and the development of artificial intelligence subtly reshapes the boundaries of economic rights, bringing new ethical challenges.</p>
            <p>To address these challenges, the international community needs to find a balance between digital identity, globalization coordination, and AI ethical frameworks. Digital identity is not the terminator of traditional economic rights but a catalyst for their renewal in the new era; the coordination of economic rights in the globalization process needs to avoid the "race to the bottom" and establish a fairer and more reasonable global economic order; the ethical framework of AI needs to ensure that technology serves the well-being of all humanity, rather than becoming a tool to exacerbate social inequality.</p>
            <p>In this transformation, how to protect economic rights and find a balance between technological innovation and rights protection will determine whether we can achieve true economic freedom and social fairness in the digital age. Only by fully considering regional differences in economic rights during globalization and ensuring the fairness of economic rights under the AI ethical framework can we achieve the common goal of sustainable global economic development and social fairness.</p>
