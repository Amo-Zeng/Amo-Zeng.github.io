            <h2>From "Digital Metrics" to "User Journey": A New Dimension in Design Effectiveness Tracking</h2>
            <p>In the digital age, design is not just a combination of aesthetics and functionality; it is the core driver of user experience. Traditionally, we have measured the effectiveness of design through digital metrics such as click-through rates, bounce rates, and conversion rates. However, these metrics often only reflect a fraction of user behavior, overlooking the emotional experiences and overall journey of users during interactions. This article explores the profound transformation in design effectiveness tracking from the perspective of "digital metrics" to "user journey," offering forward-looking insights.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Limitations of Traditional Digital Metrics</h3>
            <p>Digital metrics, as a quantitative tool for assessing design effectiveness, have been widely used in evaluating various products and services. Click-through rates reflect user interest in a particular element, bounce rates reveal the duration of user stay on a page, and conversion rates directly relate to the achievement of business goals. However, the limitations of these metrics are also evident:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Single Perspective:</strong> Digital metrics usually focus on a specific behavior or outcome, unable to comprehensively reflect the overall user experience during interactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring Emotions:</strong> Digital metrics primarily focus on behavioral data, neglecting the emotional experiences of users during interactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Static Evaluation:</strong> Digital metrics are typically static, reflecting only the effectiveness at a specific moment or stage, unable to capture the dynamic changes in user interactions over time.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>User Journey: A New Perspective on Design Effectiveness</h3>
            <p>The user journey refers to the entire process a user goes through from their first contact with a product to the final achievement of their goal, including various stages and interaction points. Extending design effectiveness tracking from single digital metrics to the user journey means we are focusing on the influence of design throughout the entire user experience process, rather than isolated nodes.</p>
            <h4>Tracking and Analyzing Key Nodes</h4>
            <p>Within the user journey, there are multiple key nodes, which are the core interaction points between users and the product. By tracking these nodes, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how design influences user behavior and emotions at different stages.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>First Contact:</strong> The first impression when users first encounter the product is crucial.</li>
                <li><strong>Information Acquisition:</strong> During the process of information acquisition, design needs to ensure clarity and ease of understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>Interaction Experience:</strong> When users interact with the product, design should provide smooth and intuitive operation experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Goal Achievement:</strong> The ultimate goal of users is to complete a task or achieve a purpose.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Quantifying the Impact of Design on User Emotions</h4>
            <p>In addition to behavioral data, the emotional experiences during the user journey are equally important. Design is not just about functionality; it is also about emotion transmission. By quantifying the impact of design on user emotions, we can more comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of design.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Satisfaction:</strong> Overall user satisfaction with the product is an important indicator of design effectiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>Pleasure:</strong> Pleasure is the positive emotional experience users feel during interactions with the product.</li>
                <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Trust is the level of trust users have in the product, directly affecting user loyalty and willingness to continue using the product.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>From "Static Screenshots" to "Dynamic Interactions": A Revolutionary Shift in Design Presentation</h3>
            <p>In the field of digital design, effectively showcasing design results has always been an important topic. Traditionally, designers have relied on static screenshots or GIFs to present their work. However, although simple and intuitive, this method cannot fully demonstrate the dynamic characteristics and full user experience of the design. With technological advancements and evolving design concepts, we are witnessing a revolutionary shift from "static screenshots" to "dynamic interactions."</p>
            <h4>Limitations of Static Screenshots</h4>
            <p>Static screenshots are one of the most common design presentation methods. By capturing a moment of the design, they quickly convey visual information. However, the limitations of static screenshots are also evident:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Lack of Dynamism:</strong> Static screenshots cannot show the animation effects, transition animations, and interaction responses of the design.</li>
                <li><strong>Incomplete Information:</strong> A single screenshot can only present partial information of the design, unable to show the full user flow and interaction paths.</li>
                <li><strong>Difficulty in Identifying Issues:</strong> Due to the lack of real user interaction, static screenshots are difficult to reveal potential problems in the design.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Towards a New Era of Dynamic Interactions</h4>
            <p>To overcome the limitations of static screenshots, designers are exploring more dynamic and interactive presentation methods. Here are two emerging practices:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Using Screen Recording Tools to Capture User Interaction Processes:</strong> Screen recording can showcase animation effects, interaction responses, and user flows.</li>
                <li><strong>Employing Interactive Prototype Tools for Dynamic Demonstration:</strong> Interactive prototypes can simulate real user interactions, demonstrating the full user flow.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>From "Designer's Perspective" to "Diverse Perspectives": A Paradigm Shift in Design Evaluation</h3>
            <p>For a long time, as the "creator" of design, designers often hold supreme evaluation power over their own work. However, in today's complex and ever-changing market environment, the limitations of this single perspective are becoming increasingly apparent, necessitating a paradigm shift towards "diverse perspectives."</p>
            <h4>Limitations of "Designer's Perspective"</h4>
            <p>The limitations of "designer's perspective" are mainly reflected in the following aspects:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Strong Subjectivity:</strong> Designers' personal preferences and experiential judgments often influence evaluation results.</li>
                <li><strong>Disconnected from Users:</strong> Designers tend to overlook users' real needs and experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Data Support:</strong> Relying solely on subjective judgment, lacking objective data support.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Value and Practice of "Diverse Perspectives"</h4>
            <p>"Diverse perspectives" emphasize incorporating user feedback, data analysis, multidisciplinary collaboration, and other evaluation dimensions.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Incorporating User Testing and Data Analysis:</strong> User feedback and usage data are important criteria for evaluating design effectiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>Inviting Multidisciplinary Collaborative Evaluation:</strong> Participation from different departments can inject diverse perspectives into design evaluation.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>From "digital metrics" to "user journey," from "static screenshots" to "dynamic interactions," from "designer's perspective" to "diverse perspectives," design effectiveness tracking and presentation have entered a new dimension. By focusing on key nodes and emotional experiences in the user journey, leveraging dynamic interaction tools to showcase design results, and introducing diverse evaluation perspectives, we can more comprehensively and deeply evaluate design effectiveness, thereby providing users with a higher quality and more enjoyable experience.</p>
