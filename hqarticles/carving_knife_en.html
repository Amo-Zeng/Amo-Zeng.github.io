            <h3>Ancient Tool, Modern Art: The Origin and Evolution of the Carving Knife</h3>
            <p>The history of the carving knife dates back to the Stone Age. At that time, early humans used simple stone tools for carving, initiating the primitive exploration of beauty. With the development of metallurgy, the material of carving knives transitioned from stone to bronze, iron, and finally modern alloys and digital technology. This evolution is not just a technological advancement but also a reflection of human civilization.</p>
            <p>In ancient Egypt and Greece, carving knives were used to sculpt gods and reliefs, showcasing the glory of early civilizations. In ancient China, carving knives were renowned for their exquisite craftsmanship and rich expressive techniques, embodying the aesthetics and wisdom of the Chinese nation. During the Renaissance, carving knives became the weapon of choice for artists. Masters like Michelangelo and Bernini brought life to marble through their carving knives, creating timeless classics.</p>
            <p>In modern times, the form of carving knives has undergone revolutionary changes. The Industrial Revolution brought mechanized production, and the advent of electric carving knives and CNC engraving machines greatly improved the efficiency and precision of carving. With the arrival of the digital era, carving knives have become virtualized. Tools like 3D modeling software, laser engraving machines, and CNC milling machines have diversified the art of carving. However, despite the changes in form, the warmth and emotion of manual carving cannot be fully replaced.</p>
