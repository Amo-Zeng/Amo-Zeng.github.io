            <h2>Fieldwork in the Dual Wave of Digitalization and Globalization: Reconstruction and Renewal</h2>
            <p>Fieldwork, as the cornerstone of disciplines such as anthropology and sociology, has long held an important position in academic research due to its deep portrayal of "other" cultures and meticulous interpretation of social phenomena. However, under the impact of the dual waves of digitalization and globalization, the traditional paradigm of fieldwork is facing unprecedented challenges and opportunities. The technological innovation of digitalization has brought disruptive changes to fieldwork, while globalization demands that fieldwork transcend the limitations of "locality" and build a more explanatory globalized research network. Driven by these dual waves, fieldwork is undergoing a quiet revolution, with both reconstruction and renewal occurring simultaneously.</p>

            <h3>Digitalization: The Technological Revolution in Fieldwork</h3>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technology is reshaping the form of fieldwork in unprecedented ways. The application of technologies such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), drone aerial photography, 3D scanning, and artificial intelligence allows fieldwork to go beyond traditional methods of observation, recording, and analysis. Researchers can obtain high-precision surface data through drones, use 3D scanning technology to reconstruct site models, and leverage AI to rapidly analyze massive datasets, thereby breaking the limitations of traditional fieldwork in terms of time, space, and accuracy. For example, digital archaeologists have successfully restored the ancient city of Palmyra, which was destroyed by war, using drone aerial photography and 3D modeling technology, bringing this historical city that had been asleep for thousands of years back to life.</p>
            <p>However, the application of digital technology does not completely negate traditional fieldwork but instead transforms and upgrades it creatively. Digital tools do not replace researchers themselves but serve as a "third eye" to help them observe and understand the world more comprehensively and deeply. For instance, virtual reality technology can virtually restore digitized archaeological sites, allowing researchers to immerse themselves in historical scenarios and gain experiences that are difficult to achieve with traditional fieldwork. Additionally, digital technology promotes interdisciplinary and cross-regional collaboration, breaking the limitations of time and space, enabling fieldwork to gather global wisdom and create greater value.</p>
            <p>In the digital era, fieldwork is no longer just about data collection but involves deep analysis and interpretation driven by data. Researchers need to have interdisciplinary knowledge, master digital technology tools, and possess data analysis and interpretation skills. They are no longer mere observers but producers, analysts, and interpreters of data, needing to find clues in massive datasets, uncover hidden patterns, and construct new knowledge systems.</p>

            <h3>Globalization: Expanding the Vision of Fieldwork</h3>
            <p>In today's world, where globalization sweeps across the globe and cultural exchanges become increasingly frequent, the traditional fieldwork model that emphasizes "locality" has shown its limitations. Traditional fieldwork focuses on "locality," examining the research object within a specific temporal and spatial context. While this perspective can deeply reveal the uniqueness of local knowledge, it also risks leading to biases akin to "looking at a leopard through a tube." The advent of the global era has made the connections between local and global increasingly close, with various cross-border cultural flows, economic activities, and social relationships continuously reshaping the landscape of local societies. Focusing solely on "locality" while ignoring the global forces behind it can easily lead to a one-sided and narrow understanding.</p>
            <p>Facing the challenges brought by globalization, fieldwork needs to introduce a "global" perspective, examining local phenomena within a broader global context. This means paying attention to the interaction between global and local, building comparative perspectives, and emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration. Global issues often involve multiple disciplines, requiring researchers from different backgrounds to work together and explore from multiple dimensions and levels.</p>

            <h3>Glocalization: The Future Direction of Fieldwork</h3>
            <p>"Glocalization" is a new concept that combines "globalization" and "localization," emphasizing the mutual penetration and influence of global and local elements. Building a glocalized fieldwork research network requires establishing cross-regional and cross-cultural research alliances, creating sharing platforms, and cultivating researchers with both global vision and local care. By integrating "locality" and "globality," we can more comprehensively and deeply understand the diversity and complexity of human society, providing stronger theoretical support and practical guidance for addressing global issues.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The dual waves of digitalization and globalization are reshaping the paradigm and practice of fieldwork. In this quiet revolution, digital technology has brought disruptive changes to fieldwork, while globalization demands that fieldwork transcend the limitations of "locality" and build a more explanatory glocalized research network. Looking to the future, fieldwork needs to further promote the deep integration of digital technology and fieldwork, develop more intelligent and portable tools, and enhance the efficiency of data collection, processing, and analysis. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the protection of digital cultural heritage, establish and improve digital resource sharing mechanisms, avoid the emergence of digital divides, and allow more people to share the fruits of civilization in the digital era.</p>
            <p>In this transformation, researchers need to maintain an open mindset, actively embrace new technologies, while also坚守 the original intention of fieldwork, using the power of technology to safeguard the legacy of human civilization and allowing fieldwork to shine more brightly in the digital age. By integrating digital technology and a global perspective, fieldwork will no longer be confined to the limitations of a single discipline or region but will become a bridge connecting global and local, past and future, providing a more comprehensive and deep understanding and support for the sustainable development of human society.</p>
