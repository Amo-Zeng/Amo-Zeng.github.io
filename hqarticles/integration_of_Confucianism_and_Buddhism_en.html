            <h3>Application of Confucian-Buddhist Integration in Modern Social Governance</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Combination of "Virtue Governance" and "Rule of Law"</strong>
                    <p>Confucian "Virtue Governance" emphasizes enhancing citizens' moral qualities through moral education, while modern social governance emphasizes the importance of "Rule of Law." The idea of Confucian-Buddhist integration encourages us to combine "Virtue Governance" with "Rule of Law," enhancing citizens' moral qualities through moral education and maintaining social order through legal norms.</p>
                    <p>For example, by conducting moral education activities, citizens' moral qualities and social responsibilities can be improved, thereby reducing social conflicts. At the same time, by establishing a sound legal system, social order can be maintained and citizens' legal rights and interests can be protected. Confucian "Rite Governance" emphasizes achieving social harmony through rituals and norms, which can be applied in modern social governance by establishing social norms and codes of conduct to promote social harmony and stability.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Combination of "Charity" and "Public Welfare"</strong>
                    <p>Buddhist "Charity" emphasizes achieving inner purification and external harmony through giving and helping others, while modern social governance emphasizes the importance of "Public Welfare." The idea of Confucian-Buddhist integration encourages us to combine "Charity" with "Public Welfare," helping vulnerable groups through charitable activities and promoting social equity and justice through public welfare.</p>
                    <p>For example, by conducting charitable activities, the living standards and social status of the poor and vulnerable groups can be improved. At the same time, by promoting public welfare, social equity and justice can be advanced, reducing social inequality. Buddhist "Giving" emphasizes achieving inner purification and external harmony through helping others, which can be applied in modern social governance by promoting charitable and public welfare activities to achieve social harmony and stability.</p>
