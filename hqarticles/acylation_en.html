            <h2>Acylation Reactions: The Pathway from Green Chemistry to Intelligent Drug Design</h2>
            <p>Acylation reactions, as a core technology in organic synthetic chemistry, are widely applied in the fields of medicine, materials, and pesticides. They are critical for constructing complex molecular frameworks and realizing functional modifications. However, traditional acylation reactions rely on toxic and harmful transition metal catalysts, volatile solvents, and non-renewable petroleum-based raw materials, posing severe challenges to the environment and human health. To address these challenges, scientists are actively promoting the transformation of acylation reactions from green chemistry to intelligent drug design, paving the way for a future that is more efficient, environmentally friendly, precise, and sustainable.</p>

            <h3>I. The Green Chemistry Revolution: The Sustainable Path of Acylation Reactions</h3>
            <h4>1. Breaking Free from Transition Metals: The Rise of Organocatalysts</h4>
            <p>In traditional acylation reactions, transition metal catalysts (such as palladium, platinum, and copper) dominate, but their high cost, toxicity, and difficulty in recovery limit their widespread application. The emergence of organocatalysts provides a green alternative for acylation reactions. Organocatalysts possess diverse structures, high selectivity, and environmental friendliness, and can be easily modified and regulated through simple chemical methods. For example, Br√∏nsted acid-base catalysts (such as Lewis acids) can activate substrates and reagents through hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions, enabling acylation reactions under mild conditions. Additionally, phase transfer catalysts (such as quaternary ammonium salts and crown ethers) can efficiently catalyze acylation reactions in aqueous systems, further reducing the use of organic solvents.</p>
            <h4>2. Solvent-Free Reactions: The Shift from "Wet" to "Dry"</h4>
            <p>Traditional acylation reactions are typically conducted in organic solvents, which not only consume a large amount of energy and resources but also produce significant amounts of waste liquid, imposing a burden on the environment. Solvent-free reactions, conducted in the absence of solvents or with minimal solvent, provide an effective solution to this problem. For instance, methods such as mechanical grinding, ultrasonic treatment, and microwave heating have been successfully applied to various acylation reactions, including Friedel-Crafts acylation and esterification, demonstrating good reactivity and selectivity.</p>
            <h4>3. Bio-Based Raw Materials: Embracing Renewable Resources</h4>
            <p>The non-renewability of petroleum-based raw materials and their negative environmental impact have prompted scientists to turn their attention to renewable resources. Bio-based raw materials, such as alcohols, acids, and ketones derived from biomass, offer a wide range of sources, renewability, and environmental friendliness, providing new opportunities for acylation reactions. For example, esterification reactions using biomass-derived carboxylic acids and alcohols can produce a series of environmentally friendly bio-based polyester materials. Additionally, biomass-derived ketones as acylation reagents can efficiently react with amines to produce important drug intermediates.</p>
            <h4>4. Recyclable Catalytic Systems: Circular Use, Reduced Waste</h4>
            <p>Designing recyclable catalytic systems is crucial for achieving sustainable acylation reactions. Researchers are working on developing new catalytic systems that can be efficiently separated and reused. For example, catalysts supported on polymer carriers can achieve solid-liquid separation, facilitating the recovery and reuse of catalysts. Moreover, ionic liquids, as a new type of green solvent and catalyst, exhibit excellent chemical stability and reusability, showing promising applications in acylation reactions.</p>

            <h3>II. The Intelligent Revolution: Precise Synthesis and Efficient Discovery of Acylation Reactions</h3>
            <h4>1. Empowered by Automated Laboratories: From Trial and Error to Precise Synthesis</h4>
            <p>The rise of automated laboratories has provided unprecedented convenience for acylation reactions. Through automated synthesis equipment, researchers can precisely control reaction parameters (such as temperature, pressure, reagent ratio, and catalyst amount) and rapidly screen reaction conditions. For example, automated liquid handling platforms can efficiently perform reagent addition, mixing, and transfer, while automated reaction vessels can monitor and regulate long-term reactions without human intervention. These technologies not only significantly improve experimental efficiency but also reduce human error, providing a solid foundation for the optimization of acylation reactions.</p>
            <h4>2. Machine Learning-Driven: From Data to Insights</h4>
            <p>Machine learning algorithms provide powerful data-driven tools for the optimization of acylation reactions. By analyzing reaction data (such as reaction time, temperature, catalyst type, yield, and selectivity), machine learning models can uncover potential patterns from massive datasets, predict optimal reaction conditions, and discover new reaction pathways. For instance, algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest have been successfully applied to predict the yield and selectivity of acylation reactions, significantly improving reaction optimization efficiency.</p>
            <h4>3. Intelligent-Driven Discovery of New Catalysts and Reaction Pathways</h4>
            <p>Intelligent technologies not only optimize existing acylation reactions but also accelerate the discovery of new catalysts and reaction pathways. By combining automated laboratories and machine learning algorithms, researchers can build a "chemical reaction database," recording catalyst performance, product distribution, and reaction mechanisms under different reaction conditions. Based on this data, machine learning models can predict the activity of new catalysts and design more efficient reaction pathways.</p>

            <h4>1. The Central Role of Acylation Reactions in Drug Design</h4>
            <p>Acylation reactions play a significant role in drug design, allowing for the modification of a drug molecule's polarity and solubility, regulation of metabolic stability, and enhancement of target specificity. For example, the introduction of lipophilic acyl groups through acylation reactions can enhance the lipophilicity of drug molecules, improving their ability to penetrate biological membranes and bioavailability.</p>
            <h4>2. Targeted Acylation Strategies: Precisely Controlling Drug Bioactivity</h4>
            <p>Targeted acylation strategies, through the design of specific reaction conditions and catalytic systems, achieve precise control over the site of acyl group introduction. This strategy not only enhances reaction selectivity but also provides greater flexibility for the functionalization of drug molecules. For instance, site-selective acylation can optimize the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs, while directed acylation can enhance drug targeting.</p>
            <h4>3. Unique Advantages of Acylation Reactions: Structural Regulation and Functional Optimization</h4>
            <p>Acylation reactions can introduce various acyl groups with mild reaction conditions and high selectivity, offering rich options for the functionalization of drug molecules. For example, in the design of anticancer drugs and nervous system drugs, acylation reactions are widely used to modify the lipophilicity and targeting of drug molecules.</p>
