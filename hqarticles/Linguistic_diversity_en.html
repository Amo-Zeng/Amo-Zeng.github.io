            <h2>Linguistic Diversity: The Gene and Emotional Bond of Human Civilization</h2>
            <p>In the tide of globalization, linguistic diversity is facing unprecedented threats. Over 7,000 languages are spoken worldwide, with more than half facing extinction. This phenomenon not only reveals the changes in communication methods but also triggers a profound crisis concerning the survival of human civilization. Linguistic diversity, as the DNA and emotional bond of human civilization, carries the multiple perspectives of human cognition, the source of innovative thinking, and the emotional bond of identity. It is a core component of our shared spiritual home.</p>

            <h3>Linguistic Diversity: The Gene Bank of Civilization</h3>
            <p>Language is the carrier of cultural genes. Each language is like an independent gene bank, preserving a unique way of perceiving and thinking about the world for specific ethnic groups. These cultural genes are the source of human civilization's innovation, providing diverse thinking paths to address the challenges we collectively face. Just as biodiversity ensures innovation in nature, linguistic diversity is the foundation of cultural innovation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cultural Genes:</strong> Each language carries unique cultural genes, recording the unique ways humans perceive and think about the world.</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Map:</strong> Each language is a unique "cognitive map," depicting the user's perception and understanding of the world.</li>
                <li><strong>Diverse Perspectives:</strong> Diverse cognitive methods prevent the homogenization and bias of human cognition, helping us to understand the complex and ever-changing world more comprehensively and profoundly.</li>
            </ul>
