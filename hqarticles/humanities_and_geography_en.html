            <h2>Multi-layered Interweaving of Space: Emotion, Culture, and Gender in the Digital Age</h2>
            <p>In the tide of the digital age, the concept of space is undergoing unprecedented reconstruction and expansion. Traditional physical spaces are intertwined with emerging data-driven spaces, shaping a multi-layered, multi-dimensional spatial system. Within this system, emotion, culture, and gender emerge as three crucial dimensions. They not only influence the generation and consumption of space independently but also collectively shape the spatial form of society through complex interactions. This article will explore the multi-layered interweaving of space in the digital age and its profound social implications from three perspectives: **data-driven space and emotional geography**, **spatial production and consumption of intangible cultural heritage**, and **gender and infrastructure**.</p>

            <h3>Data-driven Space and Emotional Geography: Digital Expression of Emotion and Ethical Boundaries</h3>
            <p>With the普及 of big data, social media, and location-based services, our daily lives are undergoing a silent revolution. Every click, share, and location update quietly converts our behaviors, emotions, and spatial positions into data, weaving a vast digital network. This data-driven space, which we call **data-driven space**, not only changes the way we perceive and experience the world but also opens up new fields for the study of **emotional geography**.</p>
            <h4>Digital Expression of Emotion</h4>
            <p>In data-driven spaces, emotions are no longer abstract inner experiences but can be quantified, analyzed, and visualized as data. Geotags, emojis, likes, and comments on social media platforms serve as digital carriers of emotion. By analyzing these data, we can map emotional distributions across different cities, regions, or social groups, revealing the emotional landscape hidden behind the space.</p>
            <h4>Data-driven Research in Emotional Geography</h4>
            <p>Emotional geography aims to explore the relationship between emotions and space, and data-driven spaces provide powerful tools for this research. By combining emotional analysis algorithms, we can delve into the impact of specific events on people's emotional geographic distribution. For example, during natural disasters, the negative emotional index in affected areas rises sharply, while sympathy and support emotions in neighboring areas also increase. This emotional geographic diffusion not only reflects the commonality of human emotions but also reveals the significant role of social networks in emotional propagation.</p>
            <h4>Reshaping Effects and Ethical Considerations of Data-driven Spaces</h4>
            <p>Data-driven spaces not only change the way emotions are expressed and studied but also reshape interpersonal relationships, community identity, and cultural exchange. Firstly, data-driven spaces make emotional expression more public and transparent. People can share their emotional experiences in real-time through social media, creating a form of **collective emotional writing**. This collective writing not only strengthens emotional connections within the community but also promotes cross-regional emotional exchange.</p>

            <h3>Spatial Production and Consumption of Intangible Cultural Heritage: Cultural Inheritance and Regional Reconstruction</h3>
            <p>Intangible cultural heritage (hereinafter referred to as "ICH") serves as a unique cultural symbol system, carrying history, memory, and craftsmanship, and is a product of specific regional spaces and social relations. The process of spatial production and consumption of ICH is essentially the result of the interaction between cultural inheritance, regional identity, and modern consumption.</p>
            <h4>Reconstruction of Regional Space by ICH</h4>
            <p>The generation and transmission of ICH are often closely related to specific natural environments, historical contexts, and social structures. For example, traditional handicrafts are intricately linked to regional raw materials, climate conditions, and social division of labor. These ICH projects are not only the inheritance of craftsmanship but also carriers of collective memory and cultural identity in specific regions.</p>
            <h4>Spatial Interaction of Tourists, Residents, and Cultural Practitioners</h4>
            <p>The development of cultural tourism has altered the "circle" structure of ICH传承. In the past, the inheritance and consumption of ICH were primarily limited within specific communities. Today, they are increasingly oriented towards external tourists. This shift not only changes the way ICH is presented but also influences local residents' perceptions and attitudes towards their own culture.</p>
            <h4>Digital Technology and Expansion of ICH Space</h4>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technology has brought new possibilities for the spatial production and consumption of ICH. Technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) allow ICH to break through physical space limitations and enter broader virtual spaces. For instance, people can "visit" ICH exhibitions through digital platforms or learn traditional crafts through online courses.</p>

            <h3>Gender and Infrastructure: Mapping Social Relations and Reconstructing Power Dynamics</h3>
            <p>Infrastructure is not merely a collection of steel and concrete; it is a reflection of social relations and a concrete manifestation of power structures. Within this reflection, gender differences play a crucial role. Whether in the planning, construction, use, or maintenance of infrastructure, the involvement and experiences of different gender groups vary significantly, revealing the gender power dynamics behind infrastructure.</p>
            <h4>Gender Differences in Infrastructure</h4>
            <p>Firstly, examining the involvement of different gender groups in the planning, construction, use, and maintenance of infrastructure reveals significant gender biases. Traditionally, infrastructure planning and construction are considered male domains, with very low participation from women. This gender segregation not only leads to the neglect of women's needs in infrastructure planning but also reinforces existing gender power structures.</p>
            <h4>Impact of Urban Infrastructure on Women's Daily Lives</h4>
            <p>Urban infrastructure profoundly affects women's daily activity spaces, sense of security, and quality of life. The design of public transportation systems directly influences women's travel choices and frequency. If public transportation systems are unsafe or inconvenient at night, women may choose to reduce their outings, thereby limiting their social and professional development opportunities.</p>
            <h4>Incorporating Gender Perspectives in Infrastructure Planning and Design</h4>
            <p>To build a more inclusive and equitable spatial environment and promote gender equality, gender perspectives must be integrated into infrastructure planning and design. Firstly, the participation of women in infrastructure planning and decision-making processes needs to be increased. By raising the proportion of women in planning committees and design teams, women's needs and opinions can be fully considered.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Multi-layered Interweaving of Space and the Future of Society</h3>
            <p>In the context of the digital age, the concept of space is no longer confined to the physical dimension. Through the multi-layered interweaving of data-driven, cultural, and gender perspectives, it展现出前所未有的复杂性和多样性. Emotional geography reveals the dynamic relationship between emotion and space through data-driven methods, while the spatial production and consumption of intangible cultural heritage illustrate the interaction between cultural inheritance and modern consumption. The gender perspective in infrastructure unveils the profound mapping of social power relations.</p>
