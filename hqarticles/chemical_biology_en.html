            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the fields of modern medicine and biotechnology, innovative drug delivery systems and precise chemical applications are key to improving therapeutic outcomes and reducing side effects. Nanomedicine delivery systems (NDDS) incorporate principles from chemical biology, while bioorthogonal chemistry provides tools for selective reactions in living systems. Additionally, advancements in enzyme engineering and synthetic biology support these technologies at a deeper level, driving progress in medical and industrial applications. This article explores how the integration of these advanced technologies can achieve more precise, efficient drug delivery, disease diagnosis, and treatment.</p>

            <h3>I. Chemical Biology Design of Nanomedicine Delivery Systems</h3>
            <h4>1. Targeted Delivery and Recognition</h4>
            <p>Chemical biology enables scientists to design nanoparticles with surfaces that can carry specific ligands or antibodies to recognize and bind to markers on the surface of specific cells. For example, using Folate receptor alpha (FRα) as a target, nanoparticles can specifically deliver drugs to cancer cells that overexpress FRα. This targeting capability not only enhances the efficacy of drugs but also significantly reduces damage to normal cells.</p>
            <h4>2. Drug Encapsulation and Controlled Release</h4>
            <p>The design of nanocarriers can not only encapsulate drugs but also control their release under specific conditions. For instance, pH-sensitive polymers disintegrate in the low pH of the tumor microenvironment, triggering drug release. Combined with bioorthogonal chemistry, nanoparticles can achieve precise drug release inside living cells through strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) reactions without catalysts.</p>
            <h4>3. Enhancing Biocompatibility and Membrane Penetration</h4>
            <p>Surface modifications of nanoparticles, such as pegylation, not only increase their stability and biocompatibility but also help them pass through cell membranes. By modifying with positive charges or surfactants, nanoparticles can more effectively enter the cell interior.</p>
