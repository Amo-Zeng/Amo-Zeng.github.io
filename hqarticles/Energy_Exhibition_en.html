            <h3>Disruptive Technologies Leading the Future</h3>
            <p>A series of disruptive energy technologies became the highlight of the exhibition.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Controlled Nuclear Fusion Technology:</strong> Known as the "artificial sun," it simulates the nuclear fusion reactions inside the Sun, converting isotopes of hydrogen into helium and releasing tremendous energy. Unlike current nuclear fission technology, nuclear fusion produces almost no long-term radioactive waste and has a wide range of fuel sources, making it the ultimate energy solution.</li>
                <li><strong>Artificial Photosynthesis Technology:</strong> Mimicking the photosynthesis process in nature, it converts solar energy directly into chemical energy through artificial synthesis. It not only efficiently captures solar energy but also converts carbon dioxide into fuels or other useful substances, achieving carbon neutrality or even negative carbon emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Fourth-Generation Nuclear Reactor Technology:</strong> Compared to traditional nuclear reactors, the fourth-generation nuclear reactors use more advanced designs and materials, featuring higher safety, economy, and environmental friendliness.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
