            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The history of human civilization is essentially a history of constantly reshaping the relationship between humans and tools. From the simple tools of the Stone Age, to the complex machines of the Industrial Revolution, and then to the intelligent systems of the Information Age, each technological revolution has redefined the boundaries of productivity. Currently, the integration of artificial intelligence, big data, and the concept of green development is driving industrial production to transform from "manufacturing" to "smart manufacturing," from "human-machine collaboration" to "human-machine symbiosis," and building a sustainable green manufacturing system on this basis. This series of changes marks a new stage in industrial civilization.</p>

            <h2>Smart Transformation of Production Relations: From "Human-Machine Collaboration" to "Human-Machine Symbiosis"</h2>
            <h3>The Core of Paradigm Shift: From Tool Rationality to Deep Integration</h3>
            <p>The "human-machine collaboration" model emphasizes the division and coordination of labor between humans and machines, with machines serving as tools to support human decision-making and creative work. However, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, machines are no longer merely a supplement to human capabilities, but have gained the ability for autonomous learning, data-driven decision-making, and complementarity with human thinking. This change drives the production relationship from "human-machine collaboration" to "human-machine symbiosis," forming a deep integration and complementary relationship between humans and machines.</p>
            <h3>Smart Manufacturing: The Core Carrier of Reshaping Productivity</h3>
            <p>In the field of smart manufacturing, the "human-machine symbiosis" model has demonstrated strong transformative power. Smart factories, by introducing artificial intelligence technology, have built a complex production network composed of humans, robots, and intelligent systems. On the production line, intelligent robots can not only complete traditional tasks but also perceive the environment in real-time through sensors and machine vision, making autonomous decisions and collaborating with human workers. This collaborative model not only enhances production efficiency but, more importantly, achieves deep integration of human and machine capabilities.</p>
            <h3>Reconstruction of Production Relations: Far-Reaching Impacts of the New Model</h3>
            <p>The impact of the "human-machine symbiosis" model on production relations is comprehensive, not only changing the structure of productivity but also reshaping various levels of production relations. At the organizational level, traditional pyramid management models are being replaced by flat and networked organizational forms. At the role level, the positioning of employees is undergoing fundamental changes.</p>

            <h2>Data Reshaping Industrial Future: The Underlying Logic Change from "Manufacturing" to "Smart Manufacturing"</h2>
            <h3>From Material-Driven to Data-Driven Paradigm Shift</h3>
            <p>Traditional manufacturing relies on the input of material capital and labor, based on the scarcity of material resources, aiming for more efficient use of limited material resources. However, the advent of Industry 4.0 marks a fundamental change in production logic. Data is becoming a new production factor, and machines are transforming from simple tools to intelligent entities capable of autonomous decision-making.</p>
            <h3>Digital Twin: Building a New Smart Manufacturing Ecosystem of Virtual-Physical Integration</h3>
            <p>The application of digital twin technology is a significant feature of smart manufacturing. By constructing a digital model in the virtual space that corresponds exactly to the physical equipment, companies can achieve precise simulation and prediction of the production process. This virtual-physical integration model is reshaping the operational logic of traditional manufacturing.</p>

            <h2>Green Manufacturing: The Imperative Path to Sustainable Development</h2>
            <h3>The Connotation and Significance of Green Manufacturing</h3>
            <p>Green manufacturing refers to integrating the concept of green development into the entire manufacturing process, achieving advanced manufacturing through technological innovation, process optimization, and management enhancement. This mode aims for efficient resource utilization, environmental friendliness, and a unified economic and social benefits.</p>
            <h3>Three Major Driving Forces of Green Manufacturing</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Addressing Resource and Environmental Constraints, Promoting High-Quality Economic Development</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Industrial Competitiveness, Capturing the Future Development High Ground</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Fulfilling Social Responsibility, Building a Community with a Shared Future for Humanity</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Implementation Pathways for Green Manufacturing</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Government Level: Strengthening Top-Level Design</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Enterprise Level: Speeding Up Technological Innovation</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Societal Level: Advocating for Green Lifestyles</strong></li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Conclusion: The Future of Smart and Sustainable</h2>
            <p>From "human-machine collaboration" to "human-machine symbiosis," from "manufacturing" to "smart manufacturing," and then to green manufacturing, intelligence, data, and greenization are reshaping the underlying logic of industrial production. These changes are not just technological progress but a deep restructuring of production methods, organizational forms, and social relations. In this process, we need to embrace the opportunities brought by technological advancements with an open and inclusive attitude, actively explore the best models of human-machine symbiosis, promote the development of green manufacturing, and achieve the coordinated unity of economy, society, and the environment.</p>
