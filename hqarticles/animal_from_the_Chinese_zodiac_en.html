            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Zodiac culture, as one of the quintessential aspects of traditional Chinese culture, is not only a marker of the passage of time but also a cultural symbol bearing profound historical and folkloric significance. Spanning millennia, it influences and shapes our cultural identity in a unique manner. This article attempts to explore the origins, dissemination, and evolution of zodiac culture, as well as its manifestation in contemporary environmental philosophy, to uncover the intrinsic value of this "cultural gene" and discuss its significance in modern society.</p>

            <h3>Origins and Dissemination of Zodiac Culture</h3>
            <p>The roots of zodiac culture can be traced back to prehistoric times when humans were still exploring natural laws and trying to establish an annual system closely related to agricultural production by observing animal behaviors and seasonal changes. This initial zodiac system was both a product of agricultural civilization and an organizer of daily life, helping ancient people predict farming seasons and providing emotional sustenance for cultural identity.</p>
            <p>The dissemination of zodiac culture relied on oral traditional wisdom and the written legacy of文人墨客 (literati). Ancient folk tales, poetry, opera, and other art forms all conveyed the symbolic meanings of the zodiac. Over time, zodiac culture crossed geographical boundaries through mediums such as the Silk Road, interacting with neighboring regions and even more distant countries, gradually forming a diverse yet unified zodiac cultural sphere.</p>

            <h3>Evolution of Zodiac Culture and Its Deep Psychological Significance</h3>
            <p>Zodiac culture evolved continuously throughout history. Initially, regional differences in geography and cultural backgrounds led to varying choices and sequences of zodiac animals. However, as cultural exchanges and integration progressed, the twelve-zodiac system became increasingly standardized. In different historical periods, zodiac culture intertwined with societal backgrounds, religious beliefs, and folk traditions, presenting a rich and varied tapestry.</p>
            <p>From a psychological perspective, the zodiac is not merely a method of timekeeping but also a profound reflection of collective unconsciousness. Each zodiac animal carries unique symbolic traits, which are not coincidental but rather the distillation and summary of animal characteristics from collective human experience. For example, the cleverness of the rat, the perseverance of the ox, and the courage of the tiger are all qualities humans wish to express through the zodiac. This phenomenon of projecting self-expectations through zodiac animals is termed "self-projection" in psychology, revealing how people express their emotions and ideals through external cultural symbols.</p>
            <p>Even more profoundly, zodiac culture embodies human reverence for nature and life. In primitive societies, humans understood and adapted to natural rhythms by observing and mimicking animal behaviors. Each zodiac animal was carefully chosen to represent aspects of the natural world. For instance, the rat as the first zodiac animal symbolizes not only its reproductive ability and survival wisdom but also the resilience and wisdom of life. This reverence for and understanding of nature are deeply rooted in the collective cultural heritage of humankind.</p>

            <h3>Environmental Philosophy in Zodiac Culture and Its Modern Significance</h3>
            <p>From the initial "animal worship" to the later "ecological wisdom," zodiac culture chronicles the transformation of human attitudes and understanding of nature. In ancient times, due to limited cognitive abilities, animals were seen as vehicles of mysterious forces, leading to corresponding worship. The twelve zodiac animals, such as the rat, ox, tiger, and rabbit, were not only common in daily life but also seen as divine incarnations. This animal worship reflected early human naturalist views and a sense of awe towards natural forces.</p>
            <p>With the development of human society, natural views transitioned from worship to understanding and respect, and zodiac culture evolved into a manifestation of ecological wisdom. This shift profoundly influenced attitudes and behaviors towards nature. The zodiac animals ceased to be mere objects of worship, becoming symbols of understanding natural laws and pursuing harmony between humans and nature. For example, the dragon symbolizes not only power and authority but also the forces and changes of nature. Through the worship of the dragon, people came to recognize the irresistible power of nature, learning to respect and adapt to it.</p>
            <p>In the context of increasingly severe global environmental issues, the ecological wisdom embedded in zodiac culture offers valuable insights. Respecting nature, adapting to it, and striving for harmonious coexistence are the modern teachings of zodiac culture. While promoting socio-economic development, we must also prioritize environmental protection and sustainable development, making ecological civilization the keynote of the new era.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Zodiac culture, a cultural gene that transcends time and space, carries the profound history of the Chinese nation and the process of diverse cultural integration. In the context of globalization, zodiac culture not only preserves its traditional cultural essence but also continues to influence lifestyles and thought patterns through innovation and development. Deep exploration and research into zodiac culture not only help in inheriting and promoting优秀的 (excellent) traditional Chinese culture but also foster cultural diversity and exchange, contributing wisdom and strength to building a community with a shared future for humanity. Moreover, the ecological wisdom in zodiac culture is of significant guidance to modern environmental protection, reminding us to protect the natural environment we rely on while pursuing development, achieving harmonious coexistence between humanity and nature.</p>
