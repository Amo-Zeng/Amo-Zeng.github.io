            <h2>Waste Sorting: The Intersection of Technology, Economy, and Culture</h2>
            <p>Waste sorting is not just about environmental protection; it is intricately linked with technology, economy, and culture, forming a powerful force for social change. Here are some suggestions to enhance the quality and depth of the article:</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>1. Add Specific Case Studies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technology Application:</strong> For example, the smart trash bin project in Shenzhen has improved the accuracy of waste sorting through AI recognition technology, reducing manual labor costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Incentives:</strong> Germany's "Green Dot" system incentivizes companies to recycle packaging materials through economic means, significantly increasing recycling rates.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Phenomenon:</strong> In Japan, "Garbage Sorting Days" are not just about waste disposal but also part of community cohesion and cultural education.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>2. Enhance Logical Coherence</h3>
            <p>Add transitional sentences to make the article flow smoother. For instance, between technology application and economic incentives, you could say: "These technologies not only improve the efficiency of waste sorting but also provide a new platform for economic incentives."</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>3. Look to the Future</h3>
            <p>In the future, waste sorting might further leverage autonomous driving technology and more refined processing technologies to promote the development of a circular economy.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>4. Increase Novelty</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Introduce the concept of "Zero Waste Living," discussing how waste sorting can reduce waste.</li>
                <li>Discuss the role of psychology and sociology in enhancing public participation in waste sorting.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>5. Language and Style</h3>
            <p>The article should maintain a professional yet readable language style, using metaphors and vivid descriptions to explain complex concepts.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>6. Charts or Data Support</h3>
            <p>For instance, show the relationship between the prevalence of smart trash bins and the accuracy of waste sorting, or a graph of recycling rates changes in different countries.</p>
