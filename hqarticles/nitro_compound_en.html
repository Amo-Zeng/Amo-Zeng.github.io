            <h3>1. Environmentally Friendly Nitration Reactions</h3>
            <h4>Green Chemistry: Exploration of Environmentally Friendly Nitration Reactions</h4>
            <p><strong>Background</strong><br>Traditional nitration reactions typically use concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids as reagents, which not only corrode equipment but also produce large amounts of sulfate wastewater. Recently, researchers have been seeking more environmentally friendly and safer alternatives.</p>
            <p><strong>Alternative Methods</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solid Acid Catalysts</strong>: Materials like zeolites and molecular sieves can replace liquid acids, reducing the discharge of acidic wastewater.</li>
                <li><strong>Ionic Liquids</strong>: As reaction media, ionic liquids can be recycled, reducing solvent usage.</li>
                <li><strong>Microwave Heating</strong>: Microwave heating can shorten reaction times, increase reaction efficiency, and reduce energy consumption.</li>
                <li><strong>Enzyme Catalysis</strong>: Using biological enzymes for nitration reactions is not only environmentally friendly but also highly efficient under mild conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Case Analysis</strong><br>For example, studies have shown that using zeolite catalysts for the nitration of benzene not only provides mild reaction conditions but also achieves yields above 90%, with virtually no acidic wastewater produced.</p>
            <p><strong>Future Outlook</strong><br>Future research will focus on developing more efficient and economical catalysts and reaction systems to achieve complete green nitration and reduce environmental impact.</p>
