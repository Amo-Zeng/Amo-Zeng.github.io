            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), as one of the most commonly used activation functions in the field of deep learning, holds a significant position in neural networks due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, ReLU is not merely a simple nonlinear transformation tool; its ability to enable sparse representation in neural networks, its connections with biological neuroscience, and its implicit role in large language models (LLMs) provide deeper insights and inspiration. This article delves into the impact of ReLU in these areas, revealing its lasting influence in modern deep learning architectures.</p>

            <h3>ReLU's Sparse Representation Capability</h3>
            <h4>What is Sparse Representation</h4>
            <p>Sparse representation refers to a representation where most elements are zero or close to zero, with only a few elements being non-zero. In neural networks, sparse representation means that only a few neurons are activated in each layer, while the outputs of most neurons are zero. This sparsity can bring multiple benefits, including reduced computational load, improved model generalization, and enhanced model interpretability.</p>
            <h4>ReLU's Sparsity</h4>
            <p>The mathematical expression of ReLU is:</p>
            <p>\( \text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x) \)</p>
            <p>This means that when the input \( x \) is negative, the output of ReLU is zero; when the input is positive, the output equals the input. This nonlinearity allows ReLU to effectively "kill" unnecessary neurons in the network, i.e., in certain cases, some neurons' outputs are forced to zero, thereby achieving sparsity.</p>
            <h4>Mechanism of Sparse Representation</h4>
            <p>During the forward propagation of a neural network, input data is processed through a series of linear transformations and nonlinear activation functions (such as ReLU). Due to ReLU's properties, when the result of a linear transformation of input data through a neuron is negative, the neuron's output is set to zero. This means that in each layer's activation values, only a portion of neurons are activated, while the outputs of other neurons are zero, thus achieving sparsity.</p>
            <h4>Sparsity and Model Training</h4>
            <p>Sparse representation has a significant impact on the training process of neural networks. Firstly, sparsity can reduce computational load. Since most neurons' outputs are zero, the computational load in both forward and backward propagation is greatly reduced, thereby improving training efficiency. Secondly, sparsity aids in model generalization. By forcing certain neurons not to participate in the processing of certain data, the network can learn more robust features and reduce the risk of overfitting.</p>
            <h4>Sparsity and Model Interpretability</h4>
            <p>Sparse representation can also enhance the interpretability of neural networks. Since only a few neurons are activated, the network's output can be interpreted as a combination of these activated neurons. This interpretability is particularly important in certain application scenarios, such as medical image analysis or financial risk assessment, where model interpretability is crucial for the decision-making process.</p>

            <h3>ReLU's Connection with Biological Neuroscience</h3>
            <h4>The "All-or-None" Principle of Biological Neurons</h4>
            <p>In biological neurons, signal transmission follows the "All-or-None" principle. When the input signal received by a neuron reaches a threshold, the neuron <strong>fires an action potential</strong> (i.e., a nerve impulse) and transmits it along the axon. This mechanism ensures the neuron's sensitivity and consistency to specific stimuli, i.e., only stimuli that reach the threshold trigger the neuron's response.</p>
            <p>The mathematical expression of ReLU is:</p>
            <p>\( \text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x) \)</p>
            <p>This formula describes a nonlinear characteristic: when the input \( x \) is negative, ReLU's output is zero; when the input is positive, the output equals the input. This characteristic is similar to the "All-or-None" principle of biological neurons: only when the input exceeds a zero threshold will the neuron be activated, otherwise it remains silent. ReLU captures this key characteristic of biological neurons through a simple mathematical form.</p>
            <h4>ReLU's Inhibition of Negative Signals</h4>
            <p>In the biological nervous system, neurons not only receive excitatory signals (positive signals) but also receive inhibitory signals (negative signals). Inhibitory signals are transmitted through inhibitory neurons (such as GABAergic neurons) and reduce the activity of postsynaptic neurons. This mechanism plays a crucial role in regulating the stability of neural networks, controlling information flow, and preventing overactivation.</p>
            <p>ReLU mimics the inhibition mechanism by directly outputting zero for negative inputs. This characteristic can be seen as a simplified modeling of inhibitory signals: negative inputs in ReLU are completely ignored, similar to the inhibitory effect of inhibitory signals on neuronal activity in biological neurons.</p>
            <h4>ReLU and Synaptic Plasticity</h4>
            <p>Synaptic plasticity is the foundation of learning and memory in biological neural networks. It refers to the ability of synaptic strength (i.e., the strength of connections between neurons) to be adjusted based on the frequency and intensity of input signals. The most famous example is <strong>Hebb's Rule</strong>: "Cells that fire together, wire together." This plasticity mechanism allows neural networks to continuously optimize their connections through experience, thereby achieving learning.</p>
            <p>The linear growth characteristic of ReLU (i.e., for positive inputs, the output is proportional to the input) can be seen as a simple synaptic strength regulation mechanism. When the input signal is positive, ReLU allows the signal to pass without loss, similar to the enhancement of synaptic strength. This characteristic can be interpreted as a simplified synaptic plasticity model, where positive input signals strengthen the connections between neurons.</p>

            <h3>ReLU's Implicit Role in Large Language Models</h3>
            <h4>Similarity Between Positive Activation and Attention Mechanism</h4>
            <p>In large language models, the attention mechanism is a core component. The self-attention mechanism in the Transformer architecture is one of its most notable features. The self-attention mechanism calculates the similarity between each input token to determine which information is most important for the current task. This mechanism can be seen as a "filter" similar to ReLU, which only retains the most useful information for the current task and ignores irrelevant information.</p>
            <p>The mathematical expression of ReLU is:</p>
            <p>\( \text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x) \)</p>
            <p>The self-attention mechanism works by calculating the similarity between each input token and assigning attention weights based on the similarity. This mechanism shares similarities with ReLU's activation method:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Selective Activation</strong>: The self-attention mechanism selectively activates certain information through similarity calculations, similar to ReLU's selective activation through nonlinearity.</li>
                <li><strong>Information Filtering</strong>: The self-attention mechanism filters useful information through attention weights, similar to ReLU's filtering of useful information by suppressing negative inputs.</li>
                <li><strong>Sparsity</strong>: The self-attention mechanism achieves sparse information representation through the distribution of attention weights, similar to ReLU's sparse activation achieving sparse information representation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Sparsity and Model Compression</h4>
            <p>ReLU reduces computational load through sparse activation, and this idea is further extended in large language models. For example, pruning and sparse matrix operations can further improve model efficiency.</p>
            <p>In large language models, sparsity is achieved mainly through the following ways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pruning</strong>: Pruning reduces model complexity by removing unnecessary neurons and connections. This method is similar to ReLU's sparse activation, retaining only useful neurons and connections.</li>
                <li><strong>Sparse Matrix Operations</strong>: Sparse matrix operations reduce computational load by calculating only non-zero elements. This method is similar to ReLU's sparse activation, processing only useful information and ignoring useless information.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Simplicity and Model Transparency</h4>
            <p>ReLU's design is simple, easy to explain, and debug, and this idea is also continued in large language models. For example, through simple and efficient activation functions (such as GELU or Swish), models can maintain stability and interpretability in complex tasks.</p>
            <p>The advantage of simplicity is further extended in large language models. By introducing simple and efficient activation functions, models can maintain stability and interpretability in complex tasks. This design concept aligns with ReLU's simplicity and efficiency, indicating that ReLU's ideas still play an implicit role in large language models.</p>
