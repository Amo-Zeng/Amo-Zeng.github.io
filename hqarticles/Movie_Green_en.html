            <h3>The Symbolic Meaning of Green Elements</h3>
            <p>In "Green", green is more than just a color; it carries multiple symbolic meanings:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Hope and Rebirth:</strong> Green in nature is often associated with new life, growth, and vitality. In the film, the appearance of green elements often signifies hope and the possibility of rebirth. Whether it's forests, meadows, or vegetation, these green landscapes symbolize characters finding a way out of despair. For example, when the protagonist discovers an oasis in a desolate environment, it represents not only physical salvation but also a psychological turning point.</li>
                <li><strong>Escape and Freedom:</strong> Green also represents escape from confinement into open spaces. At the beginning of the movie, the protagonist is trapped in a closed, dark environment symbolizing psychological oppression and despair. When he finally escapes into a nature surrounded by green, green becomes a symbol of freedom, signifying his liberation from psychological confinement.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Light and Shadow Contrast and Visual Language</h3>
            <p>The director uses carefully crafted light and shadow contrasts to create an atmosphere of oppression yet full of hope. The dark underground world in the film represents the degeneration of human civilization and environmental degradation, symbolizing our destruction of nature. Within these dark scenes, occasional green lights represent the vitality of nature and the dawn of hope. This contrast emphasizes the conflict between nature and artificial environments, and the helplessness and desire of humans when facing ecological crises.</p>

            <h3>Camera Movement and Spatial Construction</h3>
            <p>The director's camera movements play a key role in the narrative of "Green". Long takes and follow shots are frequently used to show characters moving and exploring in complex environments, enhancing the audience's immersion. Especially when the protagonists navigate through narrow passages, the camera closely follows, allowing the audience to feel the spatial constraint and urgency of escape. Static shots appear at crucial narrative turning points, giving the audience time to reflect on and feel the changes in the environment and the emotions of the characters. In terms of spatial construction, the labyrinthine structure of the underground city symbolizes the loss and isolation of humans in modern society, with each space designed to carry symbolic meaning: narrow passages represent social oppression, enclosed rooms symbolize personal dilemmas, and the final escape hatch symbolizes freedom and rebirth.</p>

            <h3>Psychological and Ecological Interaction</h3>
            <p>Through interaction with nature, characters gradually realize their own smallness and vulnerability in the natural world. In their search for food and water, they must treat each plant and stream with care, reflecting respect and awe for nature. The film uses environmental changes to mirror the complexity and fragility of human nature, reminding viewers to reflect on our destruction of the ecosystem. Ultimately, the survivors choose to reconcile with nature, symbolizing humanity's recognition of the importance of living in harmony with nature after experiencing disaster.</p>
