            <p>In today's era of rapid globalization and informatization, the diversity and uniqueness of culture face unprecedented challenges. Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), as the precious legacy passed down through human history, is crucial for preservation and transmission. However, how to breathe new life into these ancient skills, stories, and traditions in modern society remains a pressing issue. Digital means and cross-disciplinary innovation provide us with new ideas and pathways.</p>
