                    <p>Emotional stability refers to an individual's ability to maintain emotional balance and stability when facing external changes. Research shows that there is a significant positive correlation between emotional stability and creativity. Emotionally stable individuals can better cope with stress and setbacks, maintain a positive attitude, and thus have more energy and motivation to engage in creative activities.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Self-Confidence</strong>
                    <p>Self-confidence is an individual's affirmation and trust in their abilities and value. Highly self-confident individuals are more likely to try new things, express their unique perspectives, and thus more easily produce innovative ideas and works. Self-confidence also enhances an individual's resilience, allowing them to persevere in the face of difficulties and challenges in the creative process.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Ability to Handle Stress</strong>
                    <p>The ability to handle stress refers to an individual's ability to remain calm and rational, and adopt effective coping strategies when facing stress and challenges. Creative activities often come with high levels of psychological stress, and the ability to handle stress can help individuals maintain clear thinking and efficient work states in high-pressure environments, thereby better exercising their creativity.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

                    <p>Intrinsic motivation refers to an individual's motivation to engage in an activity coming from internal interest and passion, rather than external rewards and pressure. Highly intrinsically motivated individuals are more likely to maintain long-term creative work and gain more satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment in the process.</p>
