            <p>In Ionesco's "The Bald Soprano," dialogues between characters are filled with meaningless repetition and chaos, revealing the profound dilemmas of human communication. This absurdist technique appears particularly relevant in today's context of "post-truth" and "information overload." When "facts" can be reshaped and truth becomes a subjective choice, has language been reduced to meaningless noise? This article will use the approach of absurdist theater to explore how individuals navigate "information warfare" to find truth amidst fake news, and the tension between illusion and reality in linguistic communication.</p>

            <h3>The Failure and Chaos of Language</h3>
            <p>In "The Bald Soprano," Ionesco demonstrates the failure and chaos of language through nonsensical dialogues. This technique holds even greater contemporary significance. In the post-truth era, information overload makes it difficult to distinguish truth from falsehood, and language becomes meaningless noise. Political slogans, influencer rhetoric, and AI-generated language repeat endlessly yet fail to convey genuine emotion. This failure and chaos of language lies at the heart of absurdist theater.</p>

            <h3>The Individual in Information Warfare</h3>
            <p>In "information warfare," individuals become passive recipients of information. They endlessly repeat political slogans, influencer catchphrases, and AI-generated language, yet cannot express authentic emotions. This meaningless repetition causes individuals to lose themselves in the flood of information. Absurdist theater exposes this dilemma by portraying such senseless repetition.</p>

            <h3>The Illusion and Reality of Communication</h3>
            <p>In the post-truth era, communication becomes an illusion. People interact through language, yet language itself has lost its authentic meaning. Absurdist theater reveals the tension between the illusion and reality of communication by portraying language's failure and chaos. In the absurdist play "The Truth Lies Elsewhere," characters continuously repeat fake news but cannot find truth. This technique profoundly exposes the communication dilemmas of the post-truth era.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In the context of post-truth and information overload, the failure and chaos of language has become a central theme of absurdist theater. Through meaningless repetition and disorder, absurdist theater reveals individuals' dilemmas in information warfare and the tension between communication's illusion and reality. The absurdist play "The Truth Lies Elsewhere" profoundly exposes communication dilemmas in the post-truth era. Future research and creation could further explore language's role in the post-truth era and how absurdist techniques can reveal the profound dilemmas of human communication.</p>
