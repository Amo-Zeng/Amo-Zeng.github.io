            <h3>Discovering Wonders of the Universe</h3>
            <p>The Hubble Space Telescope (HST), developed jointly by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and ESA (European Space Agency), was successfully launched into orbit on April 24, 1990 by the Space Shuttle "Discovery".</p>

            <h3>Mission and Design</h3>
            <p>The primary objectives of the HST include: studying dark energy and the expansion of the universe, observing the formation of planets and stars, exploring the evolutionary history of galaxies, and providing data support for ground-based telescopes and future missions (such as the James Webb Telescope).</p>

            <h3>Scientific Breakthroughs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Precisely measuring the rate at which the universe is expanding</li>
                <li>Revealing the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way</li>
                <li>Capturing dynamic phenomena such as nebula collisions and planetary atmospheric escape</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Challenges and Upgrades</h3>
            <p>Hubble initially suffered from blurry images due to a problem with its main mirror, but five servicing missions by astronauts successfully corrected the issue. The HST has a 2.4-meter primary mirror, is equipped with advanced cameras and spectrometers, and has been in operation for over 34 years.</p>
