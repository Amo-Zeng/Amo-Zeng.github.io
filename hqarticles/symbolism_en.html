            <h2>"The Heart as a Bright Mirror": The Metaphor of Light and Spiritual Awakening</h2>
            <p>"The heart as a bright mirror" is a profound Zen phrase that reveals the central role of light in human spiritual pursuits. Since the dawn of civilization, light has not only been a physical phenomenon but also a spiritual totem for understanding the world and illuminating the inner self.</p>

            <h3>I. Light and Cognition: From Chaos to Clarity</h3>
            <p>At the dawn of human civilization, light became inherently linked with cognition. In the Bible, God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. This marks the beginning of creation and the starting point of cognition.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Plato's Cave Allegory:</strong> The cognitive significance of light is deeply interpreted in the cave allegory.</li>
                <li><strong>Chinese Philosophy:</strong> Light is endowed with a more profound meaning, serving as a bridge between "being" and "non-being."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Light and Awakening: From the Other to the Self</h3>
            <p>The metaphor of light holds more profound implications on a spiritual level. In Buddhism, the process of "understanding the mind and seeing one's nature" is likened to the enlightening light dispelling ignorance.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Western Philosophy:</strong> Descartes' "I think, therefore I am" and Kant's "Enlightenment" are both related to the metaphor of light.</li>
                <li><strong>Artistic Expression:</strong> During the Renaissance, painters used light to express the spiritual state of their subjects.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>III. Silence and Color: Another Kind of Light for the Soul</h3>
            <p>Beyond sound, silence is also a special kind of light. The Eastern philosophies of "silence in speech" and "keeping still" reveal silence as a wisdom transcending language.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emotional Expression of Color:</strong> Different colors convey unique emotional connotations in various cultural contexts.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>IV. The Multi-Layered Metaphor of Light: Cognition, Awakening, and Emotion</h3>
            <p>The metaphor of light manifests in multiple dimensions within the human spiritual world. It is both a tool for cognition, a symbol of awakening, and a carrier of emotion.</p>
