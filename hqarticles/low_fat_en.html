            <h2>Multidimensional Health Benefits of Low-Fat Diet</h2>
            <p>In modern society, diet is no longer merely about satisfying our appetites; it has become a critical factor affecting our physical and mental health. Low-fat diets, as a scientific health choice, are increasingly being proven by research to have a dual positive effect on both the brain and emotions. Through personalized customization, low-fat diets can not only enhance cognitive function but also improve mental health, creating a tailored health plan for each individual.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Enhancing Cognitive Function</h3>
            <p>The benefits of low-fat diets for the brain are supported by extensive research. High-fat diets may increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, while low-fat diets protect brain health by improving insulin sensitivity, reducing inflammation, and oxidative stress. For example, Omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants in low-fat diets support neuron growth and synaptic plasticity, thereby enhancing memory and learning abilities.</p>

            <h3>Improving Mental Health</h3>
            <p>In addition to its direct impact on physical health, low-fat diets can also improve mental health. By supporting the synthesis of neurotransmitters, regulating stress hormones (such as cortisol), and promoting gut health, low-fat diets can relieve emotional issues such as anxiety and depression. For instance, foods rich in tryptophan help maintain serotonin levels in the brain, while Omega-3 fatty acids aid in mood regulation.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Personalized Health Plans</h3>
            <p>Each person's genetic background, living environment, and health goals are different, so low-fat diets also need personalized customization. Through personalized diet plans, we can better meet individual nutritional needs and maximize health benefits. For example, understanding the metabolic capacity for specific nutrients through genetic testing, or adjusting Omega-3 fatty acid intake based on life stress levels, are all important components of personalized low-fat diets.</p>
