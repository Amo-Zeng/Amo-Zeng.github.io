            <h3>From Connecting the World to a Battleground for Freedom of Speech</h3>

During the **2009 Iranian Green Revolution** and the **2011 Arab Spring**, Twitter's ability to disseminate information played a crucial role, becoming an important platform for protests and social movements.</p>
