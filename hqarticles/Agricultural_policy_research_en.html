            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the context of a continuously growing global population and increasingly strained resources and environment, improving agricultural productivity and sustainability has become a critical issue for governments and the agricultural sector worldwide. Digital technology, climate change adaptation, and rural community development are the three core issues in current agricultural policy. This article will explore how policy support can promote the modernization, sustainable development, and comprehensive revitalization of rural communities through these three aspects.</p>

            <h2>Application of Digital Technology in Agriculture and Policy Support</h2>
            <p>The application of digital technology in agriculture not only enhances production efficiency but also provides new possibilities for sustainable agricultural development. Below are several key application areas and their policy support measures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smart Irrigation:</strong> By using IoT technology, real-time monitoring of soil moisture, temperature, and other environmental parameters, combined with weather data, can achieve precise irrigation, reduce water waste, and increase crop yields. Policymakers can encourage farmers to adopt smart irrigation systems through financial subsidies and technical support.</li>
                <li><strong>Precision Fertilization:</strong> Using big data analysis, personalized fertilization plans can be developed based on the growth cycle of crops and soil nutrient conditions, reducing the use of chemical fertilizers and lowering environmental pollution. The government can provide technical training and financial support to help farmers understand and use precision fertilization technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest and Disease Prediction:</strong> Through AI technology, historical data and real-time monitoring data can be analyzed to predict the occurrence of pests and diseases, allowing for early preventive measures to be taken and reducing losses. Policymakers can establish data sharing platforms, clarify data ownership and usage rights, and prevent data misuse.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Farm Machinery:</strong> By utilizing autonomous driving technology and remote monitoring, smart farm machinery can achieve intelligent operation, improving work efficiency and reducing labor costs. The government can encourage farmers and agricultural enterprises to adopt smart farm machinery through tax incentives and subsidy policies.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Importance of Policy Support</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Incentive Mechanisms:</strong> Policymakers can encourage farmers and agricultural enterprises to adopt digital technology through financial subsidies, tax incentives, and other incentive measures. For example, subsidies can be provided to farmers who purchase smart farm machinery, and tax reductions can be offered to agricultural enterprises that use precision fertilization technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Training:</strong> The government can organize technical training to enhance the digital technology application capabilities of farmers and agricultural enterprises. Through training, farmers can better understand and use new technologies, thereby improving production efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Security and Privacy Protection:</strong> Policymakers need to establish relevant regulations to ensure the security of agricultural data and protect the privacy of farmers and enterprises. For example, data sharing platforms can be established to clarify data ownership and usage rights and prevent data misuse.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Climate Change Adaptation and Agricultural Policy</h2>
            <p>Climate change has had a profound impact on global agriculture, with the frequent occurrence of extreme weather events not only threatening food security but also severely challenging the livelihoods of farmers. Therefore, formulating effective agricultural policies to help farmers and agricultural systems adapt to climate change and reduce the impact of extreme weather events on agricultural production has become a focal point of international concern.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Support for Agricultural Biodiversity Conservation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Establishing Conservation Areas:</strong> Setting up biodiversity conservation areas in agricultural regions to protect rare and endangered species and maintain ecological balance. The government can support the protection and utilization of traditional crop varieties and local varieties through policy measures to enhance the genetic diversity of agricultural systems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Promoting Diversified Planting:</strong> Encouraging farmers to plant a variety of crops to reduce the risks associated with monoculture and enhance the resilience of the system. Policymakers can promote diversified planting through subsidies and technical support.</li>
                        <li><strong>Support for Genetic Resource Conservation:</strong> Supporting the protection and utilization of traditional crop varieties and local varieties through policy measures to enhance the genetic diversity of agricultural systems.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Water Resource Management:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Improving Water Use Efficiency:</strong> Promoting water-saving irrigation technologies such as drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation to reduce water waste. The government can promote water-saving irrigation technologies through subsidies and technical training.</li>
                        <li><strong>Establishing Water Resource Management Systems:</strong>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
