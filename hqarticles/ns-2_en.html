        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>AI Enhances NS-2's Automation</h3>
            <p>Traditional network topology design often relies on manual experience, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. By incorporating machine learning algorithms, NS-2 can automatically generate network topologies that meet specific requirements. For example, algorithms based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can learn the characteristics of network topologies from historical data and generate new structures. This automation not only reduces manual intervention but also produces more diverse topologies, providing a richer experimental foundation for network design.</p>
            <p>Parameter configuration in network simulation directly impacts the accuracy of simulation results. AI techniques such as reinforcement learning or Bayesian optimization can automatically adjust network parameters, such as routing protocol configurations, link bandwidth, and latency. By training models, NS-2 can automatically find the optimal parameter configuration based on specific network requirements and performance goals, thereby improving simulation efficiency and accuracy.</p>
            <p>Traffic models are a key factor in network simulation, directly influencing the simulation results of network behavior. Using machine learning algorithms, NS-2 can learn traffic patterns from real network traffic data and automatically generate traffic models that reflect actual scenarios. For example, deep learning models can extract features from large amounts of network traffic data to generate complex traffic models, thereby more accurately simulating traffic behavior in actual networks.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>AI Optimizes NS-2's Simulation Results</h3>
            <p>AI technology can help NS-2 more accurately predict network behavior through data analysis and model training. For instance, using time series analysis and deep learning models, NS-2 can predict changes in network traffic trends and identify potential network congestion or failures in advance. Additionally, AI can simulate network behavior under different scenarios, helping researchers identify weak points in network design and propose improvement solutions.</p>
            <p>In complex network environments, potential issues are often difficult to detect through traditional simulation methods. AI techniques can automatically identify abnormal behavior or potential problems in the network through pattern recognition and anomaly detection algorithms. For example, clustering algorithms can identify abnormal nodes in the network, while anomaly detection algorithms can identify abnormal traffic. These functions enable researchers to discover issues at an early stage, preventing failures during actual deployment.</p>
            <p>AI not only identifies problems but also proposes optimization solutions. For example, using reinforcement learning algorithms, NS-2 can simulate the adaptive learning process of the network, automatically adjusting network parameters to optimize performance. Through extensive testing in the simulation environment, AI can propose optimal network configuration solutions to enhance overall network performance.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Sustainable Development of NS-2 from the Perspective of the Open Source Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>NS-2 (Network Simulator 2), as a widely used open-source software for network simulation, has been an important tool in the field of network research since its release in 1995. However, with technological advancements and increasing user demand, the sustainable development of NS-2 faces new challenges and opportunities. This article will explore how NS-2 can achieve sustainable development through its open-source characteristics, documentation support systems, and collaboration with other open-source projects, from the perspective of the open source ecosystem.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>NS-2's Open-Source Characteristics: A Community-Driven Innovation Engine</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest advantages of NS-2 is its open-source nature. The core value of open-source software lies in its open codebase and community participation. NS-2's open-source model allows researchers, developers, and technology enthusiasts worldwide to freely access, modify, and distribute its source code. This openness not only lowers the barrier to entry but also stimulates community innovation.</p>
            <p>The participation and contributions of the open-source community are key to NS-2's continuous updates and iterations. Through platforms like GitHub, developers can submit code improvements, fix vulnerabilities, and propose new feature requests. The collective wisdom of the community enables NS-2 to quickly respond to technological changes and user needs, maintaining its vitality and competitiveness. For example, community members can develop new network protocol models for NS-2, extend its functional modules, or integrate it with other open-source tools.</p>
            <p>However, governance and collaboration mechanisms within the open-source community also face challenges. NS-2 needs to establish a more transparent and efficient community management framework to encourage more developers to contribute while ensuring code quality and project direction consistency. For instance, by forming a core maintenance team and holding regular developer meetings, the community's cohesion and collaboration efficiency can be enhanced.</p>

            <h3>Building a Comprehensive Documentation and Support System: Reducing User Barriers</h3>
            <p>Although NS-2's open-source nature has brought it a broad user base, new users often struggle to get started quickly. NS-2's complexity and relatively outdated documentation system hinder its further adoption. To improve user experience, NS-2 needs to build a more comprehensive documentation and support system.</p>
            <p>First, detailed user manuals and tutorials are essential for new users. The existing NS-2 documentation covers basic functions but lacks detailed descriptions and case studies. By writing clearer and more accessible documentation, combined with practical examples and video tutorials, users can more quickly understand and master NS-2's core functions. For example, specialized tutorials and best practice guides for different network simulation scenarios—such as wireless networks and IoT—can be provided.</p>
            <p>Second, NS-2 can offer real-time support through online communities and Q&A platforms. Similar to Stack Overflow, an open-source project discussion area allows users to ask questions, share experiences, and receive answers from community experts. This interaction not only addresses users' specific issues but also promotes knowledge sharing.</p>
            <p>Finally, NS-2 can develop automation tools and plugins to simplify user operations. For example, providing a graphical user interface (GUI) or automatic script generation tools can reduce the complexity and error rate of writing simulation scripts.</p>
