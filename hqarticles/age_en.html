            <h2>The New Self-Identity and the Future of Education in the Digital Age</h2>
            <p>In today's highly developed digital age, the **integration of digital identity** with **true self** has become a topic full of opportunities yet fraught with challenges. Simultaneously, changes in social structure and the way information is disseminated have given rise to what is termed the "micro-era," further influencing our lifestyles, thought patterns, and educational system reforms. This article will explore how digital identity integrates with true self, and in this new era, how education can foster skills that are adaptable for the future.</p>

            <h3>Integration of Digital Identity with True Self</h3>
            <p>**Digital identity** originally referred only to our digital footprints on the internet, like social media accounts, usernames, and passwords, but with technological advancements, it now encompasses biometric information, online behavior data, etc. Each online action shapes our digital persona, making digital identity an extension and representation of our true self in the virtual world. Here are key points regarding the relationship between digital identity and true self:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extension of True Self:</strong> Digital identity reflects people's interests, values, and lifestyles, providing a platform for self-expression.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Fashioning and Presentation:</strong> Individuals can choose to present their true self or an idealized version in the digital world, resulting in a discrepancy between digital identity and true self.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy and Self-Protection:</strong> For privacy, many construct an online identity that differs from their true self, leading to strategic fragmentation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This integration brings numerous opportunities like personalized services, cross-regional social interactions, and self-actualization opportunities. However, it also faces challenges including identity verification, mental health, and data privacy protection.</p>

            <h3>The Concept and Impact of the Micro-Era</h3>
            <p>The "micro-era" is characterized by the prevalence of micro-content, such as short videos and microblogs, adapting to the fast-paced life of the mobile internet era. This fragmentation of information deeply affects how people allocate their attention, forming an attention economy. Social media plays a crucial role, not just as an information transmitter but also as a culture shaper. However, the micro-era also brings the following challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information Overload and Shallow Thinking:</strong> The rapid flow of information might reduce deep thinking.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy and Security:</strong> The speed and scope of information dissemination increase risks of privacy breaches and cyber security.</li>
                <li><strong>Content Quality and Authenticity:</strong> Fragmented information can easily spread falsehoods, making it difficult to discern truth from fiction.</li>
            </ul>
