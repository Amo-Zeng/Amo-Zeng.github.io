            <h2>The Visual Revolution of the Digital Age: From the Code of Strokes to the Mirror of Anxiety</h2>
            <p>Under the impetus of the current digital wave, the art world is undergoing an unprecedented visual revolution. This revolution not only reshapes the ways and forms of artistic creation but also profoundly changes our understanding of the essence of art. From the digital interpretation of strokes to the redefinition of gazing power relationships, and to the modernity dilemma reflected in the mirror of anxiety, every dimension of art is infused with new vitality in this digital wave.</p>

            <h3>I. The Code of Strokes: Art Reconstruction in the Digital Age</h3>
            <p>In the digital age, pixels become the basic units of art, with every stroke containing a code of existence. In traditional painting, strokes are a direct embodiment of the artist's physical presence. For example, Van Gogh's swirling strokes convey his anxiety and passion, while Monet's light touches reflect his obsession with light and shadow. In the digital world, this physicality is transformed into a new form of existence. The computing speed, storage capacity, and even the choice of algorithms of computers become extensions of the artist's physicality.</p>
            <p>The digital canvas transforms every touch of the artist into precise coordinate data, translating the variations of color intensity into hex codes. Painting is no longer a physical reaction of paint on canvas but a quantum leap of code in virtual space. Strokes are deconstructed into countless digital instructions, which are then rewoven into fluid visual imagery. This digital reconstruction not only preserves the tactile experience of traditional painting but also integrates the precision and infinite possibilities of the digital world, creating a new aesthetic of strokes.</p>

            <h3>II. The Power of Gazing: Visual Interaction in the Art Field</h3>
            <p>In the digital age, gazing is no longer a simple act of viewing but a socially significant behavior with power connotations. The gazing phenomenon of the "Mona Lisa" in the Louvre reveals the central position of gazing in the art field. Foucault's "Panopticon" theory provides a theoretical framework for understanding gazing: in surveillance systems, the surveilled are always in a state of being watched, while the surveillors remain hidden in positions of power. The gazing in the art field also exhibits this asymmetry: artists surveil the audience through their works, while the audience is restructured in the process of gazing at the works.</p>
            <p>Different stages of art history have witnessed subtle changes in the form of gazing. In medieval religious art, gazing is a vertical act of looking up at divinity and down at authority. During the Renaissance, the invention of perspective gave the artist's gaze a new dimension, encoding the viewer's visual experience into part of the artistic creation. In contemporary art, the bidirectional nature of gazing is more prominent, with the audience's identity shifting from the object of gazing to a participant, redefining the power relationship of gazing.</p>

            <h3>III. The Mirror of Anxiety: Visual Revelry in the Dilemma of Modernity</h3>
            <p>In the visual revelry of contemporary art, anxiety becomes a common theme. Twisted faces, shattered mirrors, labyrinthine lines, and trembling colorsâ€”these images are like non-linear narratives of modern life, reflecting the psychological landscape of contemporary people. Contemporary artists have collectively chosen "anxiety" as the main theme of their creation, which is not an accidental aggregation of images but a keen capture of the spiritual dilemma of the age.</p>
            <p>The reconstruction of human cognition in the digital age has sparked a long-lasting visual revolution. In Yoko Ono's installation "Conceptual Bedroom," the audience faces a blank space, and this minimalist visual experience is a reflection of the spiritual void after information overload in the digital age. When our vision is occupied by countless flashing screens and we switch rapidly between virtual and real worlds, the "anxiety" images in art works are actual concrete expressions of this fragmented experience.</p>

            <h3>IV. Conclusion: New Dimensions of Art in the Digital Age</h3>
            <p>The digital age not only changes the tools and forms of artistic creation but also profoundly reshapes our understanding of the essence of art. From the code of strokes to the power of gazing, from the mirror of anxiety to the revelry of vision, every dimension of art is infused with new vitality in this digital wave. In this world where virtual and real intersect, art is no longer a simple visual enjoyment but a philosophical exploration of existence, power, cognition, and self-awareness. Art in the digital age is both a heritage of the past and a question to the future, deepening our understanding of art in an unprecedented way and providing us with a mirror to recognize ourselves and our times.</p>
