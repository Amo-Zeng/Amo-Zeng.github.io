            <h3>Furniture as Space: Redefining the Boundaries of Furniture and Space</h3>
            <p>"Furniture as Space" is a revolutionary design concept that breaks the traditional notion of furniture as independent objects, instead viewing it as part of the space, or even as the "building material" of the space. This concept emphasizes the seamless integration of furniture with space, shaping and optimizing the functionality and aesthetics of the space through furniture design and layout.</p>

                <li><strong>Multi-functional Tables:</strong> Tables that serve as both workstations, dining tables, and storage spaces. This design integrates multiple functions, reducing the number of furniture pieces and saving space.</li>
                <li><strong>Movable Furniture:</strong> Furniture designed to be easily moved and reconfigured to adapt to different spatial needs and lifestyles.</li>
