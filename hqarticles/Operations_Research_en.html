            <h2>New Paradigm of Homework: Integration and Innovation of Personalization, Mental Health, and Cross-disciplinary Competence</h2>
            <p>As an important carrier of education and teaching, homework is undergoing a paradigm shift from a "tool for knowledge consolidation" to a "platform for capacity building." In the era of artificial intelligence and under the backdrop of Education 4.0, the traditional standardized homework model can no longer meet the needs of students' personalized development, nor can it effectively address the increasingly prominent mental health issues, and it is difficult to cultivate interdisciplinary composite talents required by future society. Therefore, constructing a new homework system centered on personalized learning, based on mental health, and guided by interdisciplinary competence training has become an important breakthrough point for deepening educational reforms.</p>
