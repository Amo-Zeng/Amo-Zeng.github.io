            <h2>The Role Transformation of Embassies and Consulates</h2>
            <p>Under the dual waves of globalization and digitalization, the roles of embassies and consulates are undergoing unprecedented transformations. Traditionally, they were frontline bastions of political and economic diplomacy, responsible for negotiation, cooperation, and consular services. However, with the complexity of the international situation and the acceleration of technological progress, the mission of embassies and consulates has expanded from being single providers of diplomatic services to bridges of cultural exchange, guardians of overseas security, and promoters of digital transformation. This article will explore the multiple roles and future development directions of embassies and consulates in the context of the new era from three dimensions: cultural exchange, crisis management, and digital transformation.</p>

            <h3>IV. Challenges and Future Outlook</h3>
            <p>Although embassies and consulates have made significant progress in cultural exchange, crisis management, and digital transformation, they still face numerous challenges. Issues such as cyber security threats, data privacy concerns, and the digital divide and technological gap require embassies and consulates to adopt effective response strategies. In the future, embassies and consulates should continue to deepen digital transformation, enhance crisis management capabilities, and expand the breadth and depth of cultural exchange, making greater contributions to the country's external exchanges and cooperation.</p>
