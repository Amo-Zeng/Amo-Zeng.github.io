            <h2>From "Negative Emissions" to "Positive Circulation": A Profound Change in Governance Ideology</h2>
            <p>Under the dual challenges of global climate change and air pollution, the traditional "negative emissions" governance model has gradually exposed its limitations. This model focuses on end-of-pipe treatment, alleviating environmental pressure by reducing pollutant emissions. Although it has achieved certain short-term effects, it is difficult to fundamentally resolve the predicament of air pollution. With the continuous development of the socio-economic landscape and increasing environmental pressures, we need to construct a new "positive circulation" governance paradigm, transforming air pollution management from reactive measures to proactive creation, achieving coordinated development of economy, society, and environment.</p>

            <h3>I. A Profound Change in Governance Ideology: From "Negative Emissions" to "Positive Circulation"</h3>
            <p>The traditional "negative emissions" governance model views air pollution as a byproduct of economic development, reducing environmental risks through technological means to decrease pollutant emissions. However, this model has several shortcomings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Superficial Solutions</strong>: The "negative emissions" model struggles to fundamentally address pollution issues, often falling into a vicious cycle of "emission-treatment-re-emission-re-treatment."</li>
                <li><strong>High Costs</strong>: End-of-pipe treatment requires significant financial and technical investment, imposing a heavy burden on businesses and society, with diminishing marginal benefits.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Synergy</strong>: Fragmented efforts across departments, with poor coordination, undermining collective effectiveness and maximizing governance outcomes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The "positive circulation" governance paradigm, guided by systems thinking, integrates air pollution management into the broader socio-economic framework, constructing a sustainable development system where economy, society, and environment mutually promote and positively circulate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Source Reduction</strong>: By upgrading industrial structures and optimizing energy use, pollutants are reduced at their source, promoting green and low-carbon development.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Utilization</strong>: Transforming air pollutants into resources, turning waste into treasure, achieving both economic and environmental benefits.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborative Governance</strong>: Breaking down departmental silos, establishing cross-sector and cross-regional collaborative governance mechanisms, fostering a society-wide governance framework.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. "Using Evil to Combat Evil": Innovative Utilization of Pollutants and Air Quality Improvement</h3>
            <p>Under the "positive circulation" governance paradigm, the seemingly paradoxical strategy of "using evil to combat evil" is emerging as a novel approach in environmental protection. This concept transcends traditional pollution prevention, exploring how certain air pollutants can be scientifically utilized to improve air quality.</p>
            <h4>1. Theoretical Foundation: Transformation and Utilization of Pollutants</h4>
            <p>The essence of air pollution lies in the presence and transformation processes of pollutants in the air. Traditional pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) can undergo catalytic conversion under specific conditions, becoming beneficial substances. For example, NOx can be converted into nitrogen gas, and SO2 into sulfates, processes that positively impact air quality improvement.</p>
            <p>Free radicals in the atmosphere play a role in purifying pollutants. Hydroxyl radicals (OHÂ·) are the most potent oxidizers in the atmosphere, capable of converting many pollutants into harmless substances. Enhancing free radical generation through artificial means can augment the atmosphere's self-purification abilities.</p>
            <h4>2. Technological Implementation Pathways: Catalytic Transformation and Collaborative Governance</h4>
            <p>Artificial catalytic technology is key to pollutant transformation. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology converts NOx into nitrogen gas; adsorption-catalysis technology achieves efficient SO2 transformation. These technologies have demonstrated significant results in coal-fired power plants and industrial boilers.</p>
            <p>Multicomponent pollutant collaborative governance represents the future direction. Integrating various pollutant control technologies to create synergies enables more efficient pollution control. For instance, combining NOx and SO2 treatment technologies can reduce emissions and improve resource efficiency simultaneously.</p>

            <h3>III. Cross-Sector Collaboration: Building a New Landscape for Air Pollution Prevention</h3>
            <p>Air pollution prevention is a complex system engineering endeavor, involving multiple departments such as environmental protection, energy, transportation, industry, and construction. It requires the collaborative participation of government, businesses, and the public. The traditional model of "fragmented governance" and "nine dragons controlling water" struggles to address the current challenges of air pollution management. Therefore, "cross-sector collaboration" is key to overcoming governance barriers and constructing a new landscape for air pollution prevention.</p>
            <h4>1. Breaking Departmental Silos, Building Collaborative Governance Mechanisms</h4>
            <p>Longstanding issues of unclear responsibilities, poor communication, and insufficient coordination among departments have severely hindered the overall efficiency of air pollution prevention. To break down departmental silos and build collaborative governance mechanisms, we need to focus on the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Establishing Cross-Departmental Collaboration Mechanisms</strong>: Implement an air pollution prevention joint conference system, clarify departmental responsibilities, enhance information sharing and coordination, forming a collective effort.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening Regional Joint Prevention and Control</strong>: Breaking administrative boundaries, establishing regional air pollution joint prevention and control mechanisms to address regional and cross-regional air pollution issues collectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Scientific Support and Data Sharing</strong>: Integrating air environmental monitoring data from various departments, establishing a data-sharing platform to support scientific decision-making and precise pollution reduction.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Innovating Governance Techniques, Enhancing Air Pollution Prevention Effectiveness</h4>
            <p>Cross-sector collaboration isn't just about departmental cooperation; it also involves innovation in governance concepts, models, and techniques, enhancing the overall effectiveness of air pollution prevention.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transitioning from End-of-Pipe to Source Prevention</strong>: Emphasizing source prevention and process control, accelerating the adjustment and optimization of industrial, energy, and transportation structures, reducing emissions at the root.</li>
                <li><strong>Shifting from Single to Systematic Governance</strong>: Integrating air pollution prevention with ecological civilization construction, rural revitalization, and urban renewal, achieving multi-objective collaborative governance.</li>
                <li><strong>Transferring from Government-Led to Multi-Stakeholder Governance</strong>: Leveraging market mechanisms, encouraging businesses to actively reduce emissions, and promoting public participation, forming a society-wide air pollution prevention framework.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>From "negative emissions" to "positive circulation" represents a profound shift in air pollution governance concepts and methods, essential for driving high-quality socio-economic development and achieving harmonious coexistence between humans and nature. Through innovative utilization of "using evil to combat evil" and the construction of cross-sector collaboration mechanisms, we can overcome the limitations of traditional governance models, building a new, sustainable air pollution prevention system. Looking ahead, with advancements in related technologies and their widespread application, the "positive circulation" governance paradigm will make new and greater contributions to building a beautiful China and ensuring the sustainable development of the Chinese nation.</p>
