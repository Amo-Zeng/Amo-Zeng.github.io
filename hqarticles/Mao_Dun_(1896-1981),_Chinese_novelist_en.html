            <h2>Mao Dun: A Cultural Bridge Across Time and a Pioneer of Feminism</h2>
            <p>Mao Dun, one of the giants of modern Chinese literature, not only depicted the social changes of early 20th-century China with his profound realism but also constructed a bridge connecting Chinese and Western cultures through his works. Moreover, his portrayal of female characters has provided rich grounds for discussions on modern feminism.</p>

            <h3>I. Cultural Bridge and the Integration of Diverse Literary Trends</h3>
            <p>Influenced by Western literary thoughts during the May Fourth Movement, particularly Marxism, Romanticism, and Realism, Mao Dun skillfully merged these trends in his works. In his trilogy "Eclipse" (including "Disillusion," "Hesitation," "Pursuit"), Mao Dun revealed the contradictions of capitalist society, reflecting a longing for socialist ideals; "Midnight" showcased through the character Wu Sunfu the complex mindset of capitalists in the development of national industry and the exploitative nature of capitalism. This integration not only reflects Mao Dun's deep understanding of Western literary thought but also showcases his profound roots in Chinese traditional culture.</p>
            <p>In "Spring Silkworms," Mao Dun delicately described the life of farmer Lao Tongbao's family, presenting traditional Chinese agricultural culture and the survival state of farmers. His works are not merely records of social issues but also artistic expressions of the fusion of Chinese and Western cultures. Through his literary creations, he became a platform for dialogue between Chinese and Western cultures, enhancing Western readers' understanding of Chinese culture and social change.</p>

            <h3>II. Mao Dun from a Modern Feminist Perspective</h3>
            <p>In Mao Dun's works, female characters are not just members of the family but also participants and witnesses to social reforms. For example, Mrs. Qian and Du Liniang from the "Eclipse" trilogy, Feng Yunqing from "Midnight," and Miss Lin from "Lin Family Shop," these characters in different scenarios exhibit the wisdom, resilience, and independence of women.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exploration of Multiple Identities:</strong> His female characters are not merely wives or mothers; they are also drivers of social movements and even revolutionaries.</li>
                <li><strong>Revealing Gender Inequality:</strong> Mao Dun exposes gender inequality through the predicaments women face both at home and in society.</li>
                <li><strong>Emergence of Female Autonomy:</strong> Although many female characters do not entirely escape traditional fates, their inner worlds and struggles show the growth of female autonomy.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflection on Women's Liberation:</strong> While Mao Dun did not directly propose a scheme for women's liberation, he expressed concern for women's fate and hope for the future through his works.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>III. Red Classics and Historical Changes</h3>
            <p>Mao Dun's creations in different historical periods reflected the political environment while also showing his dedication to literary arts. During the Anti-Japanese War, he indirectly supported the war through works like "Corruption"; during the War of Liberation, his works such as "Spring Silkworms" directly engaged in revolution, expressing a yearning for a new society; after the founding of New China, his editing of "The Great Series of New Chinese Literature" became symbolic of red classics; and during the socialist construction period, he still tried to retain a focus on humanity within politically colored works, like "Frost Leaves Are Redder than Flowers in February."</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Mao Dun's literary creation is not only a crystallization of the fusion of Chinese and Western cultures but also an embodiment of his role as a cultural bridge and a pioneer of feminism. In his works, he skillfully blended various literary trends, deeply depicting the changes in Chinese society and personal fate choices. Through a modern feminist reading of his works, we see his implicit support for gender equality and women's liberation. His works are not only treasures of modern Chinese literature but also occupy a place in the cultural exchange between East and West and in discussions on feminism, continuing to drive social and literary progress.</p>
