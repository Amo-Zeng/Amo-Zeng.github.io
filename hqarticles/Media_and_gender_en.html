            <h2>Gender Representation, Identity Construction, and Power Dynamics in Media</h2>
            <p>In contemporary society, media is not only a tool for information dissemination but also a significant stage for gender representation, identity construction, and power dynamics. There is a complex interaction between media and real-world perceptions, which not only shapes people's understanding of gender but also influences the construction of gender identities and the dynamics of gender power. This article will delve into how media shapes gender perceptions, how media technology impacts the construction of gender identities, and how media becomes a battlefield for gender power dynamics and resistance.</p>

            <h3>Interaction between Gender Representation in Media and Real-world Perceptions</h3>
            <p>Media, especially television shows, movies, and advertisements, profoundly influences audience's gender perceptions by portraying specific gender roles and stereotypes. Traditional male hero images are often endowed with strength, rationality, and dominance, while female characters are frequently labeled as weak, emotional, and dependent. These stereotypes not only form fixed gender perceptions in the audience's mind but may also further solidify gender inequalities in real society.</p>
            <p>However, as society increasingly values gender equality, gender representation in media is also gradually changing. More and more works are challenging traditional gender roles, presenting a more diverse and inclusive gender image. For example, shows like "Orange Is the New Black" and "Killing Eve" break traditional gender stereotypes by showcasing complex and authentic female characters, prompting the audience to understand and think more deeply about gender.</p>
            <p>Real-world gender perceptions and attitudes also continuously influence media content production and consumption. With the rise of gender equality movements, audiences demand higher standards for gender representation in media. This demand pushes media creators to pay more attention to gender equality and diversity in content production, avoiding the reappearance of stereotypes to attract and satisfy modern audiences' expectations.</p>
            <p>The consumption of media content is also changing. Through social media and online platform interactions, audiences can directly influence the direction of media content, and even participate in content creation. This participatory culture makes discussions about gender representation more open and diverse, further driving the transformation of gender images in media.</p>

            <h3>Impact of Media Technology on Gender Identity Construction</h3>
            <p>In the digital era, media technologies such as social media and virtual reality provide new platforms for the construction and expression of gender identities. The digital space, free from the constraints of the physical body, presents an unprecedented diversity and fluidity of gender. Individuals who identify as non-binary, often marginalized and suppressed in traditional binary gender systems, find new ways to express themselves in the digital world. The rise of virtual and augmented reality technologies opens up new dimensions for these individuals' gender expression.</p>
            <p>Media technologies not only promote the diversity and inclusiveness of gender identities in virtual spaces but also influence gender relations and interactions in the real world. The expression and exploration of gender on digital platforms often ripple into the real world, affecting people's gender notions and behavior patterns. The普及of these technologies is gradually breaking traditional gender boundaries and promoting gender equality.</p>
            <p>However, the potential of media technologies for promoting gender equality is not without challenges. The anonymity and decentralization of cyberspace, while facilitating the expression of gender diversity, may also breed discrimination and exclusion. How to leverage media technologies for gender equality while building a safer and more inclusive online environment is a problem that requires collective effort.</p>

            <h3>Gender Power Dynamics and Resistance in Media</h3>
            <p>Media is not only a platform for the display of gender power dynamics but also a crucial battlefield for gender resistance. Media reflects and reinforces gender power structures through its content and forms. However, media also provides a platform for gender resistance, enabling feminists and other gender activists to challenge and change these power relations through advocacy, organization, and mobilization.</p>
            <p>Gender resistors use media to expose and challenge gender discrimination and violence. Through social media, blogs, documentaries, and public events, feminists and gender activists can bring gender issues to the forefront of public discourse and mobilize supporters to participate in resistance. For example, the #MeToo movement revealed issues of sexual harassment and assault through social media platforms, sparking global discussions and actions.</p>
            <p>Media plays a crucial role in promoting gender equality education and advocacy. By producing and disseminating content on gender equality, media can help the public understand the complexity of gender issues and promote support for gender equality. For example, educational programs and public campaigns</p>
