            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Media and gender studies is a crucial field in contemporary social sciences, exploring the pivotal role of media in gender construction and expression. With the rapid advancement of digital technology, media use has become an indispensable part of modern society. This article will delve into the complex relationship between media and gender from three perspectives: data-driven gendered media use, the deconstruction and reconstruction of gender symbols, and media technology and body politics. Through these analyses, we aim to reveal the diversity and dynamics of media in gender construction and expression, providing new perspectives for future media and gender research.</p>

            <h3>Data-Driven Gendered Media Use</h3>
            <h4>Social Media: Gender Preferences in Time and Content</h4>
            <p>According to multiple research studies, women generally spend more time on social media than men. For instance, a global survey in 2022 showed that female users spent an average of 120 minutes per day on Facebook, compared to 90 minutes for males. Additionally, women are more inclined to share emotional content on social media, such as daily life, family photos, and emotional status, while men tend to focus more on news, sports, and tech-related content.</p>
            <h4>Short Video Platforms: Gender Differences in Content Creation and Consumption</h4>
            <p>Short video platforms like TikTok and Kuaishou have become significant areas of gendered media use. Data indicates that female users' content on these platforms is more oriented towards beauty, fashion, and lifestyle, whereas male users are more inclined towards tech, gaming, and sports. Furthermore, female users on short video platforms engage in more diverse interactions, including likes, comments, and shares, while male users' interactions are relatively conservative, mainly focusing on likes and views.</p>
            <h4>Gaming: Gendered Experiences and Technical Barriers</h4>
            <p>The gaming sector is another crucial area of gendered media use. According to a 2021 global gaming market report, female gamers accounted for 45% of the global gaming user base, but gender differences persist in certain types of games. For example, female gamers are more likely to prefer casual and social games like Candy Crush and Animal Crossing, while male gamers tend to engage more in competitive and hardcore games like League of Legends and PUBG. Additionally, female gamers often face gender discrimination and technical barriers, such as sexist remarks and lack of technical support.</p>
            <h4>Case Study: LGBTQ+ and Transgender Media Experiences</h4>
            <p>LGBTQ+ individuals exhibit unique media experiences. Social media and short video platforms have become important spaces for them to express themselves and seek identity. For instance, LGBTQ+ users on TikTok create and share short videos discussing gender identity, sexual orientation, and social issues, forming a unique community culture. These platforms not only provide channels for self-expression but also help build trans-regional social networks, enhancing social support.</p>
            <p>Transgender individuals face unique challenges and opportunities in media use. Virtual worlds provide them with a space to freely express and explore gender identity. For example, on virtual social platforms like Second Life, transgender individuals can create virtual characters to experiment with different gender expressions and identities. However, virtual worlds also pose threats of gender discrimination and online violence. Thus, media not only becomes a crucial tool for exploring identity but also introduces new social challenges.</p>

            <h3>Deconstruction and Reconstruction of Gender Symbols</h3>
            <h4>Semiotic Analysis: Composition, Meaning, and Evolution of Gender Symbols</h4>
            <p>Gender symbols are a type of signifier in media texts, often associated with society's inherent perceptions and stereotypes about gender. Semiotician Roland Barthes argues that signs are composed of a signifier and a signified, with gender symbols' signifiers being visual elements (like clothing, hairstyles, gestures) or linguistic elements (like gendered language expressions). For example, in traditional advertising, women are often depicted as housewives or sexual objects, while men are portrayed as career-driven or authoritative figures. These symbols not only form part of media texts but also solidify societal cultural expressions of gender roles.</p>
            <p>The meaning of gender symbols is not fixed but evolves with changes in societal cultural contexts. Semiotician Charles Sanders Peirce categorizes symbols into iconic, indexical, and symbolic signs, with gender symbols predominantly being symbolic signs, established through social consensus and cultural habits. For instance, female characters in TV dramas are often associated with traits like "gentle" and "fragile," while male characters are associated with "strong" and "rational." This meaning production and dissemination are often constrained by power relations, with media serving as a vehicle for power discourse, reinforcing societal gender perceptions through the presentation of gender symbols.</p>
            <h4>Cross-Media Comparison: Influence of Culture and Technology</h4>
            <p>There are significant differences in the presentation of gender symbols between traditional media (like TV, films, newspapers) and new media (like social media, short video platforms). Traditional media, due to its one-way communication nature, tends to present gender symbols more rigidly and stereotypically. For example, women in traditional TV ads are often depicted as housewives or sexual objects, while men are portrayed as successful professionals. This reflects traditional media's inherent perceptions of gender roles and the constraints of power relations.</p>
            <p>In contrast, new media, with its interactivity and decentralization, presents gender symbols more diversely and individually. For instance, female creators on short video platforms can showcase their talents and independence through content creation, challenging gender stereotypes in traditional media. Additionally, new media's algorithm recommendation mechanisms make the presentation of gender symbols more diverse and personalized, allowing audiences to choose content based on their interests.</p>
            <h4>Audience Engagement: Deconstruction and Reconstruction of Gender Symbols</h4>
            <p>Audiences are not just passive receivers of gender symbols but active interpreters and deconstructors. Semiotician John Fiske introduces the concept of "productive audience," emphasizing audiences' initiative and creativity in media consumption. In fan culture, audiences deconstruct and reconstruct gender symbols in the original works through "secondary creation" (like fan fiction, fan art). For example, certain female characters in TV dramas are initially portrayed with traits like "fragile" and "dependent," but fans through secondary creation, assign them new traits like "independent" and "intelligent," challenging the original gender stereotypes.</p>
            <p>Secondary creation in fan culture not only deconstructs gender symbols in the original works but also reconstructs societal gender perceptions. For instance, female creators on short video platforms showcase their talents and independence through content creation, challenging gender stereotypes in traditional media. Furthermore, the "anti-stereotyping" phenomenon in fan culture is gradually emerging, where audiences through secondary creation, assign male characters more emotional and vulnerable traits, breaking traditional media's rigid perceptions of male roles.</p>

            <h3>Media Technology and Body Politics</h3>
            <h4>Body Tracking: Ideal Standards and Body Anxiety in the Digital Age</h4>
            <p>Features like "fitness check-ins" and "beauty filters" on social media platforms have become daily practices for modern women. These features, through algorithms and image processing technology, mold women's bodies into "ideal standards" templates: slender waists, toned abs, flawless skin. These standards are not naturally occurring but products of media technology and capitalist collusion.</p>
            <p>The popularity of fitness check-ins is not just personal health pursuits but also collective social performances. Women gain social recognition through likes and comments by showcasing their fitness achievements, but this recognition is fragile, built on constantly pursuing a more perfect body. Once unable to meet the "ideal standards," women fall into deep anxiety, questioning their self-worth.</p>
            <p>Beauty filters exacerbate this anxiety further. They use algorithms to erase wrinkles, blemishes, and even alter facial contours, creating a "perfect" virtual image. The gap between this virtual image and the real body makes women more critical of their appearance, potentially leading to整容impulses. Media technology plays a dual role here: it provides a platform for self-expression while creating new aesthetic hegemonies, intensifying women's body anxiety and self-perception struggles.</p>
            <h4>Virtual Bodies: Gender Fluidity and Identity Reconstruction</h4>
            <p>The rise of virtual reality (VR) and metaverse technology offers a new space for body experiences. In virtual worlds, bodies are no longer constrained by biological gender, and gender identities exhibit unprecedented fluidity and diversity. Players can freely choose the gender, age, and even species of their virtual avatars, experiencing a body existence entirely different from the real world.</p>
            <p>This experience of gender fluidity challenges the deeply ingrained gender binary in the real world. In the metaverse, gender is no longer a fixed identity label but an attribute that can be switched at will. This experience makes people realize that gender is not an innate destiny but a socially constructed product. The gender diversity in virtual worlds provides new perspectives and possibilities for real-world gender equality movements.</p>
            <p>However, the freedom of virtual bodies comes at a cost. The trend towards perfect virtual images also brings new aesthetic standards and body anxiety. The "perfect images" in virtual worlds are often more extreme than in real life, demanding players to have unrealistic body proportions and flawless skin. These virtual aesthetic standards can also translate into real-world body pressures, exacerbating women's body anxiety.</p>
