            <h3>1. Oral Microbiome Balance: The Golden Key to Overall Health</h3>
            <h4>1. Scientific Basis: The Importance of Oral Microbiome Balance</h4>
            <p>The complexity of the oral microbiome and its relationship with systemic diseases has been extensively confirmed by scientific research. The microbes in the mouth not only affect dental and gum health but also influence the health of cardiovascular, diabetes, and respiratory systems through blood circulation.</p>
            <h4>2. Practical Case: The Close Link Between Oral Health and Overall Health</h4>
            <p>A 50-year-old male was hospitalized due to recurring angina. Upon examination, he was found to have severe periodontal disease. His doctors recommended treating the periodontal disease first before proceeding with cardiovascular treatment. After the periodontal treatment, the patient’s angina symptoms significantly improved, and his cardiovascular risk indicators also improved.</p>
            <h4>3. Practical Tips: How to Maintain Oral Microbiome Balance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Daily Oral Hygiene</strong>: Proper brushing, flossing, and using mouthwash are the foundation for maintaining oral microbiome balance.</li>
                <li><strong>Diet Adjustment</strong>: Increasing probiotic intake and reducing sugar intake help maintain the balance of oral microbes.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Dental Check-ups</strong>: Schedule a dental check-up every six months to timely detect and treat oral issues.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>1. Scientific Basis: The Multiple Impacts of Electronic Devices on Health</h4>
            <p>Prolonged use of electronic devices negatively affects vision, cervical health, and mental well-being.</p>
            <h4>2. Practical Case: The Effectiveness of Digital Detox</h4>
            <p>A 30-year-old office worker experienced blurred vision and headaches due to long-term computer use. By reducing screen time and wearing blue-light blocking glasses, his symptoms significantly improved.</p>
            <h4>3. Practical Tips: How to Implement Digital Detox</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Set "No Screen Time"</strong>: Allocate a fixed time daily to stay away from electronic devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Use "Eye Protection Mode" and Blue-Light Blocking Glasses</strong>: Reduce harm from blue light to the eyes.</li>

            <h3>3. Emotional Kitchen: Healing the Soul with Food</h3>
            <h4>1. Scientific Basis: The Close Connection Between Food and Emotions</h4>
            <p>Components such as tryptophan, Ω-3 fatty acids, and probiotics in food directly affect brain chemicals, thereby influencing mood.</p>
            <h4>2. Practical Case: How Food Heals the Soul</h4>
            <p>A 35-year-old woman treated for long-term stress and depression saw significant improvement in her emotional state by increasing her intake of tryptophan- and Ω-3 fatty acid-rich foods.</p>
            <h4>3. Practical Tips: How to Regulate Emotions Through Food</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Understand the Impact of Different Ingredients on Mood</strong>: Choose foods rich in tryptophan, Ω-3 fatty acids, and vitamin B.</li>
                <li><strong>Learn Simple Cooking Techniques</strong>: Start with simple home-cooked dishes, and try baking and fermented foods.</li>
                <li><strong>Create a Pleasant Dining Environment</strong>: Carefully set the table and create a warm dining atmosphere.</li>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In modern society, health no longer remains confined to a single physical dimension but requires comprehensive balance across multiple dimensions, such as oral microbiome balance, digital detox, and emotional kitchen.
