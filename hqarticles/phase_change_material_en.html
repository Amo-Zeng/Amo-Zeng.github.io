            <h3>Intelligent Management in Building Energy Conservation</h3>
            <p>Modern building design not only seeks a balance between aesthetics and functionality but also focuses on environmental friendliness and energy efficiency. PCMs in buildings, such as embedded in walls, ceilings, floors, or even window shading, manage to regulate indoor temperatures by absorbing and releasing heat, reducing reliance on traditional air conditioning systems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Environmental Monitoring:</strong> Using IoT technology, data from the building's internal environment is fed back in real-time, allowing the system to automatically adjust the phase change behavior of PCMs. Such monitoring systems ensure precise temperature control, reducing energy waste.</li>
                <li><strong>Predictive Control:</strong> Leveraging big data and AI to predict future temperature changes, pre-adjusting the operation of PCMs and HVAC systems to achieve energy savings. Predictive control not only conserves energy but also improves system response speed and efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>User Interaction:</strong> Provides a user interface for personalized settings of indoor temperature and energy-saving modes, enhancing user experience. Users can adjust the environment according to their needs, improving comfort and quality of life.</li>
            </ul>
