            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Since its inception, Bluetooth technology has profoundly changed our way of life, from everyday payments to smart homes, and into health monitoring domains. Bluetooth applications are ubiquitous. This article will explore how Bluetooth technology brings convenience, security, and innovation to our lives from three perspectives: payment, smart homes, and medical health monitoring.</p>

            <h3>Revolution in Payment Experience: Speed, Security, and Market Expansion</h3>
            <h4>High-Speed Transactions and Security Assurance</h4>
            <p>The evolution of Bluetooth technology, especially with Bluetooth 5.2, has significantly increased payment speed. This version supports LE Audio (Low Energy Audio) technology, which, by reducing power consumption and increasing bandwidth, enables almost instantaneous transaction processing. This technology is particularly evident in public transportation where passengers can quickly pay for fares through Bluetooth payments, greatly enhancing the efficiency of the transportation system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption and Security:</strong> Bluetooth 5.2 introduced stronger encryption standards like AES-128-CCM, ensuring the security of data transmission. Bidirectional authentication mechanisms and secure connections based on public key encryption (LE Secure Connections) further prevent identity theft and payment information leakage. Additionally, Bluetooth supports OTP (One-Time Password) mechanisms, enhancing payment security.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Seamless Payment and IoT Integration</h4>
            <p>The integration of Bluetooth technology with IoT devices makes the payment process more seamless. For example, smartwatches can connect with payment terminals allowing users to make purchases without taking out their phones, simply by being near the payment point. Moreover, using Bluetooth beacon technology, retailers can trigger payment requests automatically based on a user's location, providing precise marketing and payment experiences.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bluetooth Mesh Network:</strong> Through Mesh networks, payment data can be relayed from one device to another, ensuring stable and reliable transmission of payment data even with obstacles between the payment point and the user's device.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Opening New Markets and Scenarios</h4>
            <p>Bluetooth payment not only simplifies traditional payment processes, like its application in public transport but also drives the development of unmanned retail. In the future, Bluetooth payment is expected to become widespread globally, changing the consumption habits and market patterns of billions of people.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blockchain and Bluetooth:</strong> Combining blockchain technology with Bluetooth payments can provide greater transparency and security, reducing the risk of payment fraud, and supporting smart contracts for automatic execution, further streamlining the payment process.</li>
            </ul>
