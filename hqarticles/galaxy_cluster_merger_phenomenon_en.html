            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The merger of galaxy clusters is one of the most spectacular astrophysical events in the cosmos, involving thousands of galaxies, vast dark matter halos, and intense energy release processes. This article aims to explore two key areas: the mechanisms of gravitational wave generation and propagation, and the changes in dark matter dynamics and their impact on the structure of galaxy clusters.</p>

            <h3>1. Generation and Propagation of Gravitational Waves</h3>
            <h4>Background Knowledge</h4>
            <p>Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe, and gravitational waves are disturbances in spacetime caused by the accelerated motion of mass, traveling at the speed of light.</p>

            <h4>Mechanism of Gravitational Wave Generation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Processes</strong>: During the merger, galaxies and dark matter move at high speeds, creating spacetime disturbances.</li>
                <li><strong>Nonlinear Effects</strong>: Due to the uneven distribution of mass, the generation of gravitational waves during mergers becomes complex.</li>
                <li><strong>Radiation</strong>: Rapid changes in mass distribution radiate out in the form of gravitational waves, creating observable signals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Theoretical Models</h4>
            <p>
                - **General Relativity**: Describes how mass affects the curvature of spacetime, forming the basis for gravitational wave studies.<br>
                - **N-body Simulations**: Computer simulations track the movement of each galaxy or dark matter particle to calculate gravitational wave emissions.<br>
                - **Semi-Analytical Models**: Combine physical laws with observational data to predict characteristics of gravitational waves.
            </p>

            <h4>Propagation Mechanism</h4>
            <p>
                - **Propagation at Light Speed**: Gravitational waves travel unimpeded at the speed of light.<br>
                - **Attenuation and Diffusion**: Gravitational waves decay due to cosmic expansion as they travel further.<br>
                - **Background Noise**: Other cosmic events like supernova explosions also generate gravitational waves, creating background noise.
            </p>

            <h4>Observation and Detection</h4>
            <p>
                - **Current Detectors**: Like LIGO and VIRGO, primarily detect gravitational waves from binary systems, with limited sensitivity to low-frequency waves from galaxy cluster mergers.<br>
                - **Future Detectors**: Such as LISA, will be able to detect low-frequency gravitational waves from space, including those from galaxy cluster mergers.<br>
                - **Indirect Evidence**: By observing the morphology, temperature distribution, etc., of galaxy clusters post-merger, one can infer gravitational wave emissions.
