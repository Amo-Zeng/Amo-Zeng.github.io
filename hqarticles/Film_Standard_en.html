            <h2>Introduction: Film as Cognitive Technology — Three Interventional Pathways</h2>
            <p>Film is no longer merely a medium of entertainment, but a <strong>technical apparatus</strong> that actively reshapes human cognition. It intervenes in the mind through three interwoven pathways: <strong>memory simulation and reconstruction</strong>, <strong>temporal deconstruction and manipulation</strong>, and <strong>algorithmic production of empathy</strong>. Together, these constitute what we call "cognitive technology" — a system of audiovisual signs that deliberately intervenes in human perception, memory, and affective mechanisms.</p>
            <p>Crucially, this intervention is not neutral. It carries implicit power structures, especially in the context of technological acceleration and posthumanism, where film becomes a <strong>vanguard of cognitive governance</strong>. We must ask: Who designs these cognitive pathways? How do they reconfigure the subject’s self-understanding? This reveals a paradox: we use film to understand the world, yet we may also be redefined by it.</p>
            <p>This article takes <em>Dunkirk</em> (2017), <em>Tenet</em> (2020), <em>Parasite</em> (2019), and <em>Soul</em> (2020) as core case studies, combining cognitive science, media philosophy, and critical theory to expose how film intervenes in human cognition through technical means. Each section follows a "problem-argument-return" structure, ultimately pointing toward a deeper question: <strong>In an algorithmically dominated cognitive ecology, do we still possess cognitive sovereignty?</strong></p>
            <blockquote class="philosophical-line">Film is a mold of cognition — and a prison of consciousness.</blockquote>
        </section>

        <section>
            <div class="section-intro">Memory simulation is the first pathway through which film intervenes in cognition. Its technical logic shifts from individual recall to collective reconstruction, challenging the boundaries of "authentic memory" and exposing the risks of memory manipulation in posthuman governance.</div>
            <h2>I. Memory Simulation: From Individual Recall to Collective Reconstruction</h2>
            <p>Traditional films evoke memory through linear narratives — for instance, the flashbacks in <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>, relying on the viewer's ability to reconstruct temporal sequences. But <em>Dunkirk</em> breaks this mold. Christopher Nolan employs three parallel timelines — "one week," "one day," and "one hour" — transforming memory from individual recall into a <strong>multi-scale perceptual puzzle</strong>.</p>
            
            <div class="case-study">
                <h4><em>Dunkirk</em>: Temporal Compression and Perceptual Splicing</h4>
                <p>The film opens with soldiers running on the beach, shot with a fixed telephoto lens, background blurred, sound compressed. This is a visual encoding of "temporal compression": <strong>condensing 72 hours of psychological perception into 10 minutes of physiological rhythm</strong>. Crucially, the three timelines converge during the "one-hour" aerial sequence — when pilot Farrier runs out of fuel, the camera cuts to the sea, where soldiers look up, completing a <strong>perceptual splice</strong>.</p>
                <p>This splicing is not linear, but a <strong>non-Euclidean memory topology</strong>. The viewer must actively assemble the fragments, rather than passively receive them. Neuroscientific research shows that such nonlinear narratives activate the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in tandem, simulating the process of real memory retrieval. Thus, film becomes an <strong>exosomatic memory simulator</strong>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study contrast">
                <h4><em>Parasite</em>: Smell as an Anchor of Class Memory</h4>
                <p><em>Parasite</em> goes further, expanding memory from the individual to <strong>collective class memory</strong>. The Kim family, by forging identities, enters the Park household, their memories "implanted" as scripts of "servant" and "employer." Yet the film exposes the <strong>irreducibility of memory</strong> through "smell" — a non-visual signifier.</p>
                <p>During the storm, the Kims flee back to their semi-basement; the camera looks down, rain floods in, and smell permeates. Director Bong Joon-ho uses <strong>olfactory semiotics</strong>: smell cannot be edited or performed — it is a <strong>biological anchor</strong> of class memory. When Mr. Park pinches his nose in the car, the gesture activates the viewer’s collective memory of "olfactory discrimination" — not fictional, but a sensory residue of social trauma.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study paradox">
                <h4><em>Tenet</em>: Reverse Editing and Memory Manipulation</h4>
                <p>In contrast, <em>Dunkirk</em>’s "temporal compression" is a <strong>technological distortion of perception</strong>, while <em>Parasite</em>’s "smell memory" is a <strong>socially grounded resistance of perception</strong>. The former is directorially controlled; the latter is activated by the viewer’s bodily memory.</p>
                <p>This reveals a paradox: film can simulate memory, but it can also <strong>expose memory’s instability</strong>. When <em>Tenet</em> introduces "reverse time," this paradox reaches its extreme.</p>
                <p>In <em>Tenet</em>, the protagonist enters "inverted time": bullets fly back into guns, flames rise from ash. Nolan designs a <strong>reverse editing algorithm</strong>: forward and reverse actions coexist in the same frame, distinguished by color, sound, and direction of motion. For example, when an inverted character speaks, the audio is played backward, but subtitles run forward, creating cognitive dissonance.</p>
                <p>This editing forces viewers to maintain memory coherence across <strong>dual visual streams</strong>. It simulates the neural mechanism of "reverse time": the brain must process "past" and "future" signals simultaneously, forming <strong>parallel channels of temporal cognition</strong>. But more critically, this simulation is itself a form of <strong>memory manipulation</strong> — training viewers to accept "reverse causality" as preparation for future temporal control technologies.</p>
            </div>

            <p>In the context of "posthuman governance," ethical questions arise. If film can reconstruct collective memory, could it also be used for <strong>memory implantation or deletion</strong>? <em>Tenet</em>’s "temporal pincer maneuver" suggests that future powers might use inverted information to alter past decisions. This is not just science fiction — it is a <strong>struggle for cognitive sovereignty</strong>.</p>
            <blockquote class="philosophical-line">Film becomes an "exosomatic hard drive" for memory — but who controls the read/write permissions?<br>Memory should not be the carbon copy of an algorithm.</blockquote>
        </section>

        <section>
            <div class="section-intro">Temporal deconstruction is the second pathway. It shifts from linear narrative to time manipulation, challenging human perception of "the present," and exposing the colonization of lived time by technological time.</div>
            <h2>II. Temporal Deconstruction: From Linear Narrative to Time Manipulation</h2>
            <p>Traditional narratives depend on a linear structure: "past — present — future." But <em>Dunkirk</em> breaks this with "temporal folding." The three timelines are not parallel, but <strong>interwoven at the perceptual level</strong>. Viewers see the outcome of the "one-hour" sequence within the "one-week" timeline, creating <strong>anticipatory anxiety</strong>.</p>
            <p>This anxiety arises from the <strong>psychological effect</strong> of temporal compression: when viewers know an event is imminent but characters do not, cognitive load spikes. Neuroimaging shows such scenes activate the amygdala and insula, simulating the temporal distortion of real crisis.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h4><em>Tenet</em>: Time Mirror Systems and Distributed Cognition</h4>
                <p>In contrast, <em>Tenet</em>’s "reverse time" is an <strong>extreme form of temporal folding</strong>. The film posits that in inverted time, a person’s physiological processes and causal chains run backward. But Nolan does not simply reverse footage — he designs a <strong>time mirror system</strong>.</p>
                <p>For example, when the inverted protagonist meets the forward protagonist through a red/blue door, their actions are opposite, but the mirror reflection creates a symmetrical composition. In sound design, inverted and forward dialogue are spectrally complementary, combining into a coherent sentence. This is not just visual spectacle — it is <strong>algorithmic temporal cognition</strong>: time is no longer an objective flow, but a <strong>data stream</strong> that can be coded, compressed, and reversed.</p>
                <p>Crucially, <em>Tenet</em>’s "temporal pincer maneuver" requires coordination between forward and reverse forces. This simulates <strong>distributed temporal cognition</strong>: individuals cannot grasp the whole, but the system achieves goals through temporal misalignment. It foreshadows "distributed temporal decision-making" in future warfare or governance — where individuals act in local time, but the system coordinates across all time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study contrast">
                <h4><em>Soul</em>: Defending Lived Time</h4>
                <p>This reveals a paradox: when time is deconstructed into a programmable object, <strong>perception of "the present" weakens</strong>. In <em>Tenet</em>, the protagonist is always in a state of "future knowledge," unable to experience true "now-ness." This "temporal disorientation" is reversed in <em>Soul</em>.</p>
                <p>In <em>Soul</em>, after protagonist Joe Gardner dies, he enters the "soul world," where time loses linearity. He cannot perceive "past" or "future," only "being." Pixar uses <strong>color and motion design</strong> to emphasize this: the soul world is cool-toned, characters float, movements slow — time flows like liquid.</p>
                <p>But when Joe returns to Earth, the camera shifts to handheld shots, rapid editing, warm tones — time regains its <strong>rhythmic flow</strong>. Crucially, the film proposes the concept of "spark" (the spark of life): meaning lies not in goals, but in <strong>perception of the present</strong> — what we call "temporal presence."</p>
                <p>This contrasts sharply with <em>Tenet</em>: <em>Tenet</em> treats time as a tool; <em>Soul</em> treats time as existence. The former is <strong>expansion of technological time</strong>; the latter is <strong>defense of lived time</strong>.</p>
            </div>

            <p>In "posthuman governance," the consequence of temporal deconstruction is <strong>loss of temporal sovereignty</strong>. If film trains viewers to accept "reverse time," might society accept policies of "future intervention in the present"? For example, using algorithms to predict crime and intervene preemptively — essentially, the "temporal pincer" projected into social governance.</p>
            <blockquote class="philosophical-line">Film becomes an "exosomatic clock" for time — but who sets its rhythm?<br>Time should not be the metronome of an algorithm.</blockquote>
        </section>

        <section>
            <div class="section-intro">Empathic algorithms are the third pathway. Shifting from natural emotional resonance to technological production of empathy, they challenge the ontology of "empathy" and expose the ethical dilemmas of affective governance.</div>
            <h2>III. Empathic Algorithms: From Emotional Resonance to Affective Manipulation</h2>
            <p>Traditional films evoke empathy through character arcs and narrative conflict — e.g., the tragic romance in <em>Titanic</em>. But <em>Parasite</em> transforms empathy into an <strong>algorithm of class perception</strong> through <strong>spatial semiotics</strong> and <strong>bodily performance</strong>.</p>
            
            <div class="case-study">
                <h4><em>Parasite</em>: Vertical Visual Coding and Olfactory Empathy</h4>
                <p>The film frequently uses "high-angle" and "low-angle" shots. The Kims, at the bottom, are shot from below, creating a sense of oppression; the Parks, at the top, are shot from above, creating emotional distance. This <strong>vertical visual coding</strong> activates <strong>spatial empathy</strong> — we instinctively sympathize with those "below."</p>
                <p>More crucially, "smell" as a non-visual signifier becomes a <strong>biological trigger</strong> of empathy. When Kim Ki-taek returns to his flooded basement, the camera focuses on his feet stepping through water, smell filling the air. Viewers feel his humiliation without dialogue — this empathy is not "understanding," but <strong>resonance of bodily memory</strong>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study contrast">
                <h4><em>Soul</em>: Emotional Color Mapping and Sensory Deprivation</h4>
                <p>In contrast, <em>Soul</em> produces "existential empathy" through <strong>algorithmic design of color and sound</strong>. The film uses <strong>emotional color mapping</strong>: Joe in the soul world appears in bluish-gray; on Earth, in orange-yellow. In sound, the soul world uses electronic tones; Earth uses natural sounds.</p>
                <p>This design is grounded in <strong>affective neuroscience</strong>: warm colors activate the amygdala, natural sounds activate the hippocampus, jointly promoting "positive emotional memory." Pixar does not "tell" empathy — it <strong>directly stimulates the neural pathways of empathy</strong>.</p>
                <p>Crucially, the film proposes a <strong>reverse path</strong> for empathic algorithms: not through narrative, but through <strong>sensory deprivation</strong>. When Joe in the soul world cannot perceive time, space, or emotion, he becomes more attuned to "the now." This reveals a paradox: <strong>empathy may arise from the finitude of perception</strong>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study paradox">
                <h4><em>Tenet</em>: The Technological Breakdown of Empathy</h4>
                <p><em>Tenet</em> demonstrates the <strong>technological rupture of empathy</strong>. Inverted characters cannot form emotional connections with forward characters — their actions are opposite, speech reversed, emotions out of sync. This simulates <strong>empathic failure under technological mediation</strong>: when communication is algorithmically distorted, empathy becomes impossible.</p>
            </div>

            <p>In the "affective ethics" section, we must address a counterargument: <strong>"Algorithmic empathy can compensate for moral apathy."</strong> Supporters argue that in the digital age, human emotions grow distant, and algorithms can restore empathy through targeted stimulation — e.g., AI therapy, emotion-recognizing ads.</p>
            <p>But this view overlooks three points:<br>
                1. <strong>Algorithmic empathy is unidirectional</strong> — it stimulates emotion, but does not understand it;<br>
                2. <strong>Algorithmic empathy is disembodied</strong> — it relies on visual/auditory signals, ignoring deeper senses like touch and smell;<br>
                3. <strong>Algorithmic empathy is replicable</strong> — it can be mass-produced, leading to "emotional inflation" that devalues genuine empathy.</p>
            <p><em>Parasite</em>’s "olfactory empathy" refutes this: true empathy depends on <strong>irreproducible bodily experience</strong>. When Mr. Park pinches his nose, viewers feel not just disgust, but <strong>collective memory of class trauma</strong>. This empathy cannot be simulated by algorithms.</p>
            <p>In "posthuman governance," the consequence of empathic algorithms is <strong>the surrender of affective sovereignty</strong>. If film can "produce" empathy via algorithms, might society "manage" emotion the same way? For example, governments using emotion-recognition systems to regulate public mood — essentially, the governance of Pixar’s "soul world."</p>
            <blockquote class="philosophical-line">Film becomes an "exosomatic gland" for emotion — but who controls its secretion?<br>Empathy should not be the prisoner of an algorithm.</blockquote>
        </section>

        <section>
            <div class="section-intro">All three pathways point to a core question: In a technologically dominated cognitive ecology, how does film become a tool of cognitive governance? Each section returns to the critical dimension of "posthuman governance."</div>
            <h2>IV. Critical Return: The Problem of Posthuman Governance Across Three Pathways</h2>
            <p>In <strong>memory simulation</strong>, film becomes a technology of "exosomatic memory." But who has the right to define "authentic memory"? <em>Tenet</em>’s "temporal pincer" suggests future powers might reconstruct history through inverted information. This is not just fiction — it is a <strong>struggle for memory sovereignty</strong>.</p>
            <p>In <strong>temporal deconstruction</strong>, film trains viewers to accept "nonlinear time." But when "the present" weakens, how can individuals maintain self-continuity? <em>Soul</em>’s "spark" concept defends "temporal presence" — a <strong>symbol of lived sovereignty</strong>.</p>
            <p>In <strong>empathic algorithms</strong>, film becomes a technology of "exosomatic emotion." But when empathy is algorithmized, can humans still experience "authentic emotion"? <em>Parasite</em>’s "olfactory empathy" shows that <strong>authentic empathy depends on irreproducible bodily experience</strong>, not replicable sensory signals.</p>
            <p>Crucially, the three pathways share a <strong>technical isomorphism</strong>:<br>
                - Memory simulation relies on <strong>nonlinear narrative</strong> (<em>Dunkirk</em>);<br>
                - Temporal deconstruction relies on <strong>reverse editing</strong> (<em>Tenet</em>);<br>
                - Empathic algorithms rely on <strong>sensory coding</strong> (<em>Soul</em>, <em>Parasite</em>).</p>
            <p>This reveals a deeper trend: film is shifting from "telling stories" to <strong>"programming perception."</strong> It no longer reflects the world — it <strong>trains viewers how to perceive the world</strong>.</p>
            <p>In contrast, traditional film was a <strong>mirror of cognition</strong>; technological film is a <strong>mold of cognition</strong>. The former reflects reality; the latter shapes it.</p>
            <p>This reveals a paradox: we use film to understand the world, yet we may be redefined by it. When <em>Tenet</em> trains viewers to accept "reverse causality," are we ready for "future intervention in the present" as governance?</p>
            <p>In "posthuman governance," film becomes part of <strong>cognitive infrastructure</strong>. It collaborates with algorithms, AI, and neurotechnology to construct a closed-loop system of "perception — memory — emotion." The individual is both user and subject of this system.</p>

            <div class="section-intro">Facing the rise of film as cognitive technology, we must move from critique to action, proposing future research directions to defend cognitive sovereignty.</div>
            <h2>V. Future Directions: From Critique to Action</h2>
            
            <div class="future-direction">
                <h4>1. Neurocinematics</h4>
                <p>Should become a core field. It studies how films activate specific brain regions, quantifying the intensity of "cognitive intervention." For example, using fMRI to measure how <em>Tenet</em>’s reverse editing affects time perception. This provides scientific basis for "cognitive impact assessment."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="future-direction">
                <h4>2. Cognitive Sovereignty Legislation</h4>
                <p>Must be placed on the agenda. Analogous to "data sovereignty," we need laws to protect "cognitive sovereignty" — the individual’s autonomy over memory, time perception, and emotional experience. For example, banning films from using "reverse editing" to condition children to accept non-causal logic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="future-direction">
                <h4>3. Counter-Algorithmic Cinema</h4>
                <p>Should be encouraged. This genre deliberately breaks technical conventions — e.g., random editing, asynchronous sound, unpredictable narratives — to train viewers’ "cognitive resistance." For example, Tsai Ming-liang’s films, with long takes and silence, resist fast-paced cognitive exploitation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="future-direction">
                <h4>4. Cross-Media Cognitive Ethics</h4>
                <p>Must be established. Film, games, VR, and AI narratives share a "cognitive technology" logic. We need a unified ethical framework to prohibit manipulative techniques like "emotional addiction design" and "memory implantation narratives."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="future-direction">
                <h4>5. Public Cognitive Literacy Education</h4>
                <p>Should be integrated into curricula. Students must learn "how films affect the brain," identify techniques like "time manipulation" and "empathic algorithms," and become "cognitively autonomous viewers."</p>
            </div>

            <p>This is not anti-technology, but <strong>democratization of technology</strong>. We should not reject film as cognitive technology, but master its logic and reclaim control.</p>
            <blockquote class="philosophical-line">Technology should not define us — we should define technology.</blockquote>

            <h2>Conclusion: Reclaiming Cognitive Sovereignty in the Algorithmic Age</h2>
            <p>As cognitive technology, film has deeply penetrated human cognition. Through memory simulation, temporal deconstruction, and empathic algorithms, it reshapes our perception, memory, and emotion. These three pathways are not merely artistic innovations, but <strong>practices of cognitive governance</strong>.</p>
            <p>But we are not passive recipients. We can use neurocinematics to understand its mechanisms, cognitive sovereignty laws to defend its boundaries, and counter-algorithmic cinema to resist its manipulation.</p>
            <p>In the algorithmic age, true freedom is not choosing which film to watch — but <strong>choosing how we are seen by film</strong>.</p>
            <blockquote class="philosophical-line">Cognitive sovereignty is the final fortress of the digital age.</blockquote>
