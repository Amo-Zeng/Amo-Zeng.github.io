At the same time, businesses must maintain innovation and adaptability in a rapidly changing market while focusing on employee well-being and the health of organizational culture.

            <h3>Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Sustainability</h3>
            <p>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) requires businesses to consider their impact on society and the environment while pursuing profit. Here are key indicators:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduction of Carbon Footprint</strong>: By adopting clean energy, improving energy efficiency, and reducing waste, businesses can significantly lower their carbon footprint. For instance, many companies achieve this through energy management systems and renewable energy projects.</li>
                <li><strong>Use of Renewable Energy</strong>: Companies like Google and Apple have committed to 100% renewable energy, which not only reduces environmental pollution but also cuts long-term energy costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Engagement</strong>: Enhancing brand image and directly improving community living standards through activities like educational support, health promotion, and cultural preservation. For example, Starbucks supports local community development through its "Community Stores" project.</li>
                <li><strong>Employee Volunteerism</strong>: Many businesses encourage employees to engage in volunteer activities, offering paid leave to support volunteer work, which enhances employee engagement and improves the company's social image.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eco-friendly Products</strong>: Promoting recyclable packaging, sustainable materials, etc., to meet consumer demand for environmentally friendly products. For example, IKEA has introduced an eco-friendly furniture series.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Efficiency</strong>: Optimizing production processes to reduce waste and lower production costs. Through lean manufacturing and circular economy principles, businesses can achieve higher resource utilization efficiency.</li>

Many companies invest in green buildings and sustainable infrastructure at their operational locations.</li>
