            <h2>Social Reconstruction in the Digital Era: Bridging the Divide and Building a Resilient Society</h2>
            <p>In today's fast-developing digital technology landscape, social stratification is exhibiting new characteristics. Traditional factors such as wealth, education, and occupation remain crucial foundations for social stratification, but mastery and utilization of digital technology are emerging as new criteria for class differentiation. This shift not only reshapes social structures but also brings new challenges to social mobility. Post-pandemic, facing multiple challenges such as the digital divide, social division, and psychological trauma, how to construct a more resilient and equitable society has become a critical issue we must address.</p>

            <h3>1. The Digital Divide: Technological Reshaping of Social Stratification</h3>
            <p><strong>The digital divide</strong> is no longer simply a question of "access to the internet" but has evolved into a comprehensive differentiation in mastery and use of digital technology. This differentiation divides society into three main classes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technological Elite Class</strong>: They control the core technology of digital products and services, dominate data and algorithms, and possess unparalleled information dissemination and resource allocation capabilities. They are not only the leaders of technology but also reinforce their class status by monopolizing high-quality educational resources, social networks, and policy benefits.</li>
                <li><strong>Technologically Competent Class</strong>: Although proficient in using various digital tools, they are confined by algorithm-recommended "information cocoons," limiting their perspective to specific information circles and making it difficult to break through class restrictions. Their social participation and expression capabilities are relatively limited, making them the "middle class" of the digital era.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Marginalized Class</strong>: They lack digital devices and internet access or struggle to understand and use complex digital tools, leaving them at an absolute disadvantage in information acquisition, social participation, and employment opportunities. They are gradually excluded from mainstream society, facing the risk of being left behind by the times.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Mobility Dilemmas: Structural Factors Amplifying Social Division</h3>
            <p>In the digital era, the challenges to social mobility are not just about individual effort and opportunity but are closely related to changes in social structure. The following structural factors exacerbate difficulties in social mobility:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inequitable Distribution of Educational Resources</strong>: The trend of centralization of high-quality educational resources is becoming increasingly apparent, especially the monopoly of online education and top institutions, making it increasingly difficult for ordinary families' children to access high-quality education. The phenomenon of educational in-fighting further exacerbates this issue, with family background and economic conditions becoming key factors in determining educational opportunities.</li>
                <li><strong>Solidification of Social Networks</strong>: The rise of social media and digital social networks strengthens the dominant position of the advantaged class in resource allocation. Children from advantaged families are more likely to gain access to high-quality social resources and development opportunities through family background and social networks, while children from ordinary families struggle to break through these network barriers.</li>
                <li><strong>Unequal Distribution of Policy Benefits</strong>: Although the government has introduced a series of policies to promote social mobility, these policies often favor specific groups, especially the technologically elite class with resource advantages. Ordinary citizens struggle to benefit fairly from these policies, further reducing opportunities for social mobility.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Social Reconstruction in the Post-Pandemic Era: Pathways to Building a Resilient Society</h3>
            <p>The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic further exposed the structural issues of social mobility dilemmas. The pandemic's impact made social division more evident, with the technological marginalized class being more vulnerable during the crisis. Therefore, constructing a more resilient social structure has become an important issue in the post-pandemic era.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital Governance</strong>: The government should accelerate the construction of a digital government, leveraging big data, artificial intelligence, and other technologies to enhance the efficiency and transparency of social governance. At the same time, the government should ensure that the development of digital technology benefits all classes, avoiding technology monopolies and data hegemony that exacerbate social inequality. By narrowing the digital divide, necessary digital devices and technical training should be provided to the technological marginalized, helping them better integrate into the digital society.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Resilience Building</strong>: Communities are the basic units of society, and strengthening community self-governance and diverse participation mechanisms is crucial. By constructing a diverse participatory social governance model, encouraging technology companies, social organizations, and residents to jointly participate in community building, the community's ability to respond to emergencies and resilience can be enhanced. Communities can also build mutual support networks to provide more support and assistance to the technological marginalized.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Psychological Support System</strong>: The pandemic has had a profound impact on people's mental health, especially the technological marginalized facing greater psychological stress and anxiety. Building a resilient society must focus on mental health, establishing a nationwide social psychological support system. This includes providing professional psychological counseling services, conducting mental health education, and setting up psychological support platforms. The government and social organizations should, through policy guidance and resource support, help people rebuild social confidence and enhance their ability to cope with future uncertainties.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>4. Policy and Institutional Safeguards: Building a Fair and Inclusive Resilient Society</h3>
            <p>Building a resilient society requires strong policy and institutional safeguards. The government should implement the following measures to promote social reconstruction:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Educational Equity</strong>: Increase investment in educational resources, especially in rural and impoverished areas, to narrow educational disparities. Explore diverse educational models to provide more development opportunities for students from different backgrounds.</li>
                <li><strong>Employment Support</strong>: Provide vocational training, entrepreneurship support, and other policies to help the technological marginalized improve their employment capabilities and enhance their social competitiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Security</strong>: Improve the social security system to provide basic living保障 for vulnerable groups, ensuring they can receive necessary support during crises.</li>
                <li><strong>Universal Policy Benefits</strong>: Ensure the fair distribution of policy benefits, avoiding excessive concentration of resources in specific groups, and promoting the realization of social fairness and justice.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Social reconstruction in the digital era is a profound transformation concerning the future resilience of society. Facing multiple challenges such as the digital divide, social division, and psychological trauma, we need to take digital governance as the foundation, community resilience building as the starting point, and a social psychological support system as the safeguard to construct a fair, inclusive, and resilient society. This is not only a response to the impact of the pandemic but also a long-term plan for sustainable social development. Only by doing so can we protect the dignity and hope of every individual in an uncertain world and advance together towards a better future.</p>
