            <h3>Biomimetic Material Design: Inspired by Nature</h3>
            <p>Biomimetic material design draws inspiration from nature, mimicking the structures and functions of biological entities to create new materials. For instance, scientists have synthesized high-strength and tough fibers by mimicking the protein structure of spider silk, which has significant applications in protective equipment and biomedicine. Similarly, materials developed by mimicking the porous structure of sponges have shown great potential in environmental protection and water resource management. Additionally, by imitating the lightweight and insulating properties of bird feathers, lightweight composite materials have been developed for aerospace and construction, reducing structural weight and improving energy efficiency.</p>
