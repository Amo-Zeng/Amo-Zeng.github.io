            <p>
                To manage the dual role of AI in both empowering and threatening privacy, robust governance frameworks must be established. These must balance innovation with protection, ensuring transparency in algorithmic decision-making and ethical considerations in data use.

            <p>
                Next-generation tools and architectures aim to reconcile AI capabilities with user privacy:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Federated Learning</strong> – Model training without centralized data</li>
                <li><strong>Differential Privacy</strong> – Adding noise to datasets to prevent identification</li>
                <li><strong>Homomorphic Encryption</strong> – Performing computation on encrypted data</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Key Challenges in AI Privacy Protection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of international standards for data governance</li>
                <li>Balancing personalization with user privacy</li>
                <li>AI model transparency and accountability</li>
                <li>User consent mechanisms</li>
