            <h3>Chapter 1: The Democratization of Space Resources—From Elite Monopoly to Mass Sharing</h3>
            <p>Since humanity's first steps on the moon in 1969, space exploration has been regarded as the privilege of a few elites. However, with the rapid technological advancements and significant cost reductions, the acquisition of space resources is moving from the "ivory tower" to the mass market.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technological Innovation: Breaking Cost Barriers</strong> SpaceX's reusable rocket technology has reduced launch costs by several times, and the application of 3D printing in space manufacturing has significantly lowered the cost of satellites and space equipment. These technological breakthroughs not only allow more companies to participate in space exploration but also open the door for individual explorers.</li>
                <li><strong>Space Mining: Opening New Frontiers for Private Investment</strong> The abundant rare metals and water ice resources on asteroids and the moon offer vast prospects for space mining. With technological maturity, space mining is expected to become a new field for ordinary investments, enabling more people to share the rich rewards of space resource development.</li>
                <li><strong>Clean Energy: Space Empowering Earth's Future</strong> The establishment of space solar power stations will provide Earth with stable and clean energy supplies. The intense solar radiation in space makes solar energy utilization far more efficient than on Earth's surface, offering a solution to the global energy crisis.</li>
                <li><strong>Space Tourism: From Remote Dreams to Tangible Experiences</strong> Space travel projects by companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic allow ordinary people to experience the wonders of space. With further technological advancements, space tourism is expected to become a mass entertainment activity, fueling more people's passion for space exploration.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Chapter 2: Digital Arks—Civilization's Digital Backup and Future Survival</h3>
            <p>In the face of Earth's uncertain future, digital arks become crucial for the survival of human civilization. They are not only a digital backup of the current civilization but also a hope for future space colonization.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eternity and Diversity: The Digital Ecosystem of Civilization</strong> Digital arks utilize quantum computing and DNA storage technologies to ensure data can transcend millennia. They store all aspects of human civilization, including texts, images, audio, video, genetic sequences, and AI models, forming a comprehensive database of civilization.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-world Significance: Addressing Future Uncertainties</strong> Digital arks serve not only as backups for Earth's civilization but also as a new way to explore the universe. They can traverse interstellar distances through information dissemination, exploring farther reaches of the universe and finding new homes for humanity. They also provide future generations with tools to understand themselves and the cosmos.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenges and Future: From Science Fiction to Reality</strong> Despite facing technical, ethical, and resource allocation challenges, the construction of digital arks represents a critical step for humanity's journey to the interstellar age. In the future, with technological advancements, digital arks will transition from science fiction to reality, becoming the "digital beacons" guiding humanity's exploration of the universe.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Chapter 3: Interstellar Symbiosis—The Future of Human-Alien Symbiosis</h3>
            <p>As humanity's exploration extends into the wider universe, the possibility of encountering extraterrestrial life is transitioning from science fiction to reality. In this process, how will cross-planetary symbiotic relationships shape humanity's future?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Transformation: From Fear to Understanding</strong> Human fear of the unknown is being replaced by scientific understanding. The resilient microorganisms in Earth's extreme environments remind us that life forms may far exceed our imagination. This cognitive shift is reshaping our understanding and acceptance of "the other."</li>
                <li><strong>Technology and Empathy: Bridges Across Species Boundaries</strong> Advances in neuroscience and artificial intelligence allow us to decipher the "languages" of extraterrestrial life. Meanwhile, progress in cross-species psychology will help us establish channels of emotional resonance. This expansion of empathy is key to building cross-planetary symbiotic relationships.</li>
                <li><strong>Multidimensional Visions of Symbiotic Civilizations</strong> Cross-planetary symbiotic relationships will create new forms of civilization. Technologically, we will share knowledge of resource development and environmental transformation; biologically, we will overcome reproductive isolation to create new species; culturally, we will blend our value systems to form a universal cosmic ethics.</li>
                <li><strong>Evolution and Responsibility: Protecting the Cosmic Life Community</strong> Cross-planetary symbiotic relationships will fundamentally alter humanity's evolutionary path. Through genetic editing and bioengineering, we will actively shape ourselves to adapt to broader cosmic environments. At the same time, we bear the responsibility of protecting the cosmic ecosystem, and this global consciousness will redefine our existential philosophy.</li>
            </ul>
