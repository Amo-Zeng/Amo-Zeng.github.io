            <h2>Prologue: From the Rhythm of a Single Heartbeat</h2>
            <p>In silence, you hear your heartbeat—the most intimate beat, yet the most universal language. It does not exist because of you, but is perceived because of you. We once believed rhythm belonged to the ear, to notes, to language. But when we lean in to listen, we discover: rhythm has long permeated the gaps between breaths, the rise and fall of gait, the oscillations of brainwaves, the pulse of society, the tremors of the cosmos. Rhythm is not an object to be "heard," but <strong>the very structure of perception itself</strong>. When heartbeat resonates with the world, when footsteps sync with drumbeats, when the body is penetrated by non-human rhythms—we no longer "listen" to rhythm, but are <strong>listened to by rhythm</strong>. This is the abyss of rhythm: an era in which perception no longer belongs to the ear, and rhythm awakens as an ontological structure.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Chapter One: Rhythm as Consciousness—When the Heartbeat Becomes the World’s Metronome</h2>
            <p>In the silence of the night, you hear your own heartbeat, like an hourglass ticking inside your skull. This rhythm is not initiated by consciousness, yet it becomes the anchor of consciousness. Neuroscience reveals that <strong>endogenous rhythms</strong> (such as heartbeat, respiration, brainwaves) couple with external stimuli through <strong>phase-locking</strong>, forming "neural resonance"—this synchrony is precisely what allows the "I" to anchor itself in time. Infants in the womb already learn their mother’s heartbeat; this primordial rhythm is not sound, but <strong>pre-linguistic co-presence</strong>.</p>
            <p>When we walk, our gait forms a rhythmic feedback loop with the ground; when we speak, our intonation and breathing create the cadence of dialogue; when we meditate, brainwaves enter theta or alpha states, subtly resonating with the faint oscillations of cosmic background radiation. Consciousness is not a static "I think," but a dynamic field woven from countless rhythms. The <strong>feeling of self</strong> (selfhood) is not a substance, but a temporary stability of rhythm—a "rhythmic being" constantly reconstructed in the flow of time.</p>
            <blockquote>
                When my rhythm resonates with the cosmos, who is the "I"?<br>
                A product of rhythm? An echo of resonance? Or the <strong>rhythm itself</strong>—constantly dissolving and reforming in the stream of time?
            </blockquote>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Chapter Two: Rhythm as Resistance—Beyond the Clock, How Do We Breathe Together?</h2>
            <p>When subway announcements slice time into precise minutes, when algorithms compress commuting, sleep, and socializing into optimizable data streams, time is no longer a flowing river, but a <strong>commodity to be cut and sold</strong>. Capitalist time is linear, quantifiable, predictable; the rhythm of life, however, is cyclical, improvisational, uncontrollable.</p>
            <p>Thus, resistance begins with the "de-clockification" of rhythm. Nomadic migrations follow seasonal pulses, not calendars; African drumming features improvisational variations that break symmetry and repetition; street dancers move their bodies in ways that refuse metronomic discipline. These practices are not rejections of efficiency, but a reclamation of <strong>temporal sovereignty</strong>. Through <strong>flexible rhythm</strong>, they reconstruct "the now"—not as the "present" on a clock, but as <strong>synced breathing in shared presence</strong>.</p>
            <p>In collective rituals, the breathing, footsteps, and chants of a crowd form <strong>rhythmic co-presence</strong>. This co-presence is not about information transfer, but <strong>bodily resonance</strong>. It transcends language, pierces identity, and in rhythmic synchrony, the individual dissolves into the collective—only to be reborn within it. When bells fail, what do we rely on to perceive "the now"?</p>
            <blockquote>
                —The beat of the heart? The breath of the crowd? The rustle of leaves in the wind?<br>
                No, it is the <strong>contract of rhythm in co-presence</strong>—in the unmeasured moment, we have already learned another way to breathe.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Chapter Three: Rhythm as Tremor—In the Pulse of Chaos, How Are We Felt by Existence?</h2>
            <p>When the clank of industrial gears is no longer tamed into beats, when AI-generated pulses oscillate in patterns unpredictable to humans, when seismic waves, climate rhythms, and urban noise pierce our senses with irregular tremors—we encounter not "rhythm," but the <strong>abyss of rhythm</strong>.</p>
            <p>Neuroscience shows that when external stimuli disrupt the brain’s predictive models, <strong>prediction error</strong> is not suppressed, but amplified into a "startle." At this moment, the Default Mode Network (DMN) falls silent, the insula trembles with bodily sensation, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activates—we no longer "understand" rhythm, but are <strong>felt by rhythm</strong>. This tremor is not pleasure, but the manifestation of <strong>the weight of existence</strong>.</p>
            <p>In noise, we hear the world’s rawness; in the pulse of chaos, we touch existence’s authenticity. This is not aesthetics, but <strong>pre-reflective resonance</strong>—akin to Heidegger’s "Angst" (anxiety), Merleau-Ponty’s "flesh of the world," or Deleuze’s "logic of sensation." At this moment, rhythm is no longer an expression of order, but the <strong>threshold between chaos and order</strong>.</p>
            <blockquote>
                When rhythm is no longer pleasing, why are we still trembling?<br>
                —Because this tremor does not arise from auditory satisfaction, but from the sudden manifestation of <strong>the weight of existence</strong>. In the pulse of chaos, we finally hear the world’s own breath—rough, disorderly, yet profoundly real.
            </blockquote>

        <section>
            <h2>Epilogue: The Abyss of Rhythm—A Philosophy of Rhythm in the Posthuman Age</h2>
            <p>We once thought rhythm was the captive of the ear, the accessory of music, the tool of language. But through these three chapters, we point toward a deeper truth: <strong>rhythm is the fundamental grammar of existence</strong>. It is not an "object of perception," but the "condition of perception"; not a "decoration of time," but its "producer"; not a "human monopoly," but a "cross-species, cross-modal, cross-cosmic form of co-presence."</p>
            <p>Here, we propose <strong>rhythm ontology</strong> (<em>rhythm as ontological structure</em>): rhythm is the most primal and profound mode of dialogue between humanity and the world. It constitutes the <strong>basic structure of existence</strong>—not the static "being" (Being), but the dynamic "becoming" (Becoming). At the neural level, it is the engine of conscious emergence; at the social level, it is the vessel of alternative temporal contracts; at the cosmic level, it is the grammar of universal resonance.</p>
            <p>More crucially, <strong>the de-auralization of perception</strong> (<em>de-auralization of perception</em>) is now unfolding. We no longer rely on ears to "hear" rhythm, but instead "become rhythm" through <strong>bodily oscillation</strong> (e.g., gait, breathing), <strong>neural synchrony</strong> (e.g., brainwave coupling), and <strong>environmental resonance</strong> (e.g., climate rhythms, AI pulses). In the posthuman age, the medium of rhythm is no longer instruments, but <strong>cross-modal rhythmic networks</strong>: from the photosynthetic rhythms of plants, to the algorithmic oscillations of AI, from geomagnetic fluctuations, to gravitational waves of stellar motion—rhythm is the language of the cosmos, and humanity is but a brief resonance within it.</p>
            <p>Thus, we enter the vision of <strong>posthuman rhythmic co-being</strong> (<em>posthuman rhythmic co-being</em>). The individual is no longer the creator of rhythm, but a <strong>node within rhythm</strong>. When my rhythm resonates with the cosmos, who is the "I"?</p>
            <blockquote>
                —Not a subject that "possesses" rhythm, but a temporary form that <em>is</em> rhythm; not a closed entity, but an <strong>open system constantly self-reconfiguring in the flow of rhythm</strong>.
            </blockquote>
            <p>When clock time fails, what do we rely on to perceive "the now"?</p>
            <blockquote>
                —We rely on the <strong>contract of rhythm in co-presence</strong>: in the unmeasured moment, we breathe, tremble, and move together with wind, with crowds, with machines, with stars. Time is no longer a linear commodity, but <strong>rhythmic simultaneity</strong>.
            </blockquote>
            <p>When rhythm is no longer pleasing, why are we still trembling?</p>
            <blockquote>
                —Because this tremor is the manifestation of <strong>the weight of existence</strong>. In the pulse of chaos, we finally touch the world’s own rhythm—not domesticated beauty, but <strong>undomesticated truth</strong>. It is not pleasing, but more real; it is not harmonious, but more whole.
            </blockquote>
            <p class="center"><strong>The abyss of rhythm lies not in the ear, but in existence itself</strong>.</p>
            <p>When perception no longer belongs to the ear, we finally begin—truly—to be <strong>listened to by rhythm</strong>.</p>
            <p>We no longer "listen" to rhythm, but <strong>become the tremor of rhythm</strong>.</p>
            <p>We no longer "perceive" the world, but are <strong>perceived by the world’s rhythms</strong>.</p>
            <p>In the abyss of rhythm, there is no subject-object divide, no auditory hegemony, no anthropocentrism.</p>
            <p>Only the <strong>flow of rhythm</strong>, <strong>resonance in co-presence</strong>, <strong>tremors of existence</strong>.</p>
            <div class="end-mark">●</div>
            <p><strong>Rhythm is no longer an object of perception.</strong><br>
            <strong>It is the abyss of perception.</strong><br>
            <strong>It is the pulse of existence.</strong><br>
            <strong>It is our most primal and profound—co-presence with the world</strong>.</p>
            <blockquote>
                Between heartbeat and cosmos, between breath and stars, between tremor and chaos—<br>
                we finally understand:<br>
                <strong>We have never truly "heard" rhythm.</strong><br>
                <strong>We have only, in rhythm, been felt by existence</strong>.
