            <h2>Ransomware: From Digital Chains to Psychological Shadows, the Battleground of Law and Technology</h2>
            <p>Ransomware, once regarded as a "beginner's" tool in cybercrime, has now evolved into a digital nightmare where technology and malice intertwine. It not only plunders victims' wealth but also deeply erodes their psychological defenses, triggering a chain reaction akin to a digital plague worldwide. Facing this threat, governments around the world are joining forces to weave a legal net, attempting to eradicate this plague completely. However, the evolution and countermeasures against ransomware are far from a simple technological contest; they are a complex博弈 involving psychology, law, technology, and multiple dimensions.</p>
