            <h2>Primordial Black Holes â€“ The Bridge Between Microcosm and Macrocosm</h2>
            <p>Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are miniature black holes formed in the early universe, playing a crucial role in the research of the cosmic web and dark matter, despite being almost invisible to us. Unlike black holes formed from stellar collapse, these black holes originate from density fluctuations under extreme conditions shortly after the Big Bang. Their size can be as small as an atomic nucleus, yet their mass can reach billions of tons. This peculiar nature makes them an essential tool for studying the early evolution of the universe.</p>

            <h3>Invisible Dancers in the Cosmic Web</h3>
            <p>The existence of primordial black holes is not isolated; they are deeply connected to the cosmic web. The cosmic web is a massive structure formed by the interaction of dark matter, ordinary matter, and gravity, including galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the "filamentary structures" connecting them. These filaments act as the "skeleton" of the universe, supporting the distribution of matter. As part of the cosmic web, primordial black holes influence the distribution and movement of surrounding matter through their strong gravitational effects, becoming "dancers" in the cosmic web.</p>
            <p>Gravitational lensing, an important prediction of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, refers to the bending of light as it passes through massive objects. This effect not only applies to large celestial bodies like galaxies or black holes but also to microscopic black holes like primordial black holes. Through gravitational lensing, primordial black holes can serve as "magnifying glasses" for us to explore the structure of the cosmic web. When light from a distant celestial body (such as a galaxy or quasar) passes near a primordial black hole, the black hole's gravity causes the light to bend, creating one or more distorted images in the observer's view. This distortion helps us determine the location, mass, and distribution of primordial black holes in the cosmic web. By analyzing the characteristics of these distorted images, scientists can infer the existence of primordial black holes and their impact on the cosmic web.</p>

            <h3>Potential Candidates for Dark Matter</h3>
            <p>The riddle of dark matter has puzzled astronomers and physicists since the 1930s. Although we have abundant indirect evidence for its existence, such as galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation, its nature remains a mystery. Traditional dark matter models tend to assume the existence of some unknown particles, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) or axions. However, in recent years, primordial black holes as a novel dark matter model have gradually garnered attention from the scientific community.</p>
            <p>Primordial black holes are black holes directly formed from density fluctuations in the early universe. They formed in an extremely short time after the Big Bang when the universe was at extremely high temperatures and densities. Unlike stellar black holes formed by stellar collapse, primordial black holes have a very broad mass range, from the Planck mass (about 10^-8 kilograms) to hundreds of times the solar mass. This wide mass distribution makes primordial black holes ideal candidates for dark matter.</p>

            <h3>The Convergence of Quantum Gravity</h3>
            <p>Primordial black holes are not only the focus of dark matter research but also a key driver in the development of quantum gravity theory. Quantum gravity, connecting quantum mechanics and general relativity, is one of the most fundamental problems in physics yet to be solved. The formation and evolution of primordial black holes involve the extreme conditions of the very early universe, which are the domain described by quantum gravity theory.</p>
            <p>Hawking radiation is the first notable phenomenon where quantum mechanics and general relativity intersect. In 1974, Stephen Hawking proposed this theory, stating that black holes are not entirely "black" but slowly radiate energy through quantum effects. For primordial black holes, due to their smaller mass, the effect of Hawking radiation is more significant. This means that primordial black holes have a relatively short lifespan and begin to evaporate in the early stages of the universe. By studying the Hawking radiation of primordial black holes, scientists can observe how quantum effects manifest in strong gravitational fields.</p>

            <h3>Future Prospects</h3>
            <p>Although the role of primordial black holes in the cosmic web and dark matter research has attracted widespread attention from the scientific community, our understanding of them is still limited. Many questions remain to be answered, such as the specific formation mechanisms of primordial black holes, their distribution patterns in the cosmic web, and their specific effects on dark matter and ordinary matter. In the future, with the advancement of observational technology, particularly the further development of gravitational wave detectors and dark matter detectors, we will have the opportunity to observe primordial black holes more accurately and reveal their true role in the cosmic web.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Primordial black holes, as mysterious entities left over from the early universe, are not only the focus of dark matter research but also a key driver in the development of quantum gravity theory. By studying the Hawking radiation and the information paradox of primordial black holes, scientists can explore the contradictions between quantum mechanics and general relativity and gradually build a unified quantum gravity theory. Primordial black holes, like a bridge spanning the microcosm and macrocosm, provide us with endless possibilities to uncover the deepest mysteries of the universe. In this process, we not only gain a deeper understanding of the nature of the universe but also pave the way for future developments in physics.</p>
