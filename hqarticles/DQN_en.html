            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Deep Q-Network (DQN) as a deep learning-based reinforcement learning algorithm has achieved significant success in handling problems with high-dimensional state spaces. This article delves into the technical details and practical applications of DQN from three perspectives: firstly analyzing the stability and convergence during training, then exploring the challenges and solutions of its applications across different fields (such as gaming, financial markets, autonomous driving), and finally comparing DQN with human decision-making patterns to reveal its potential and limitations in mimicking human intelligence.</p>

            <h3>Analysis of Stability and Convergence</h3>
            <h4>Experience Replay</h4>
            <p>The core idea of experience replay is to store the agent's interactions with the environment (i.e., experiences) in a fixed-size buffer (Replay Buffer) and learn from randomly sampled experiences during training. This method reduces correlation between data, enhancing learning stability.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Store Experience</strong>: After the agent takes an action in the environment, the tuple $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})$ of state, action, reward, and new state is stored in the Replay Buffer.</li>
                <li><strong>Sample Experience</strong>: A batch of experiences $(s_i, a_i, r_i, s_{i+1})$ is randomly sampled from the Replay Buffer for training.</li>
                <li><strong>Update Q-Values</strong>: Update the parameters of the Q-network using the sampled experiences.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The mathematical principle of experience replay can be represented by the following formula:</p>
            <p>\[Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \left[ r_t + \gamma \max_{a} Q(s_{t+1}, a) - Q(s_t, a_t) \right]\]</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This article provides an in-depth analysis of DQN's potential and limitations in terms of stability and convergence, cross-domain applications, and simulating human decision-making patterns, proposing multiple improvement directions. These improvements not only enhance DQN's performance but also expand its application prospects in complex environments. Future research could continue to explore how to optimize these technologies to improve DQN's performance in more complex environments and integrate cognitive science findings to make greater breakthroughs in mimicking human intelligence.</p>
