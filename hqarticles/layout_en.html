            <h2>From Static to Dynamic: Awakening and Evolution of Design and Narrative</h2>
            <p>In the wave of digital technology, design and narrative are undergoing a profound transformation. Once, designs were static and predefined, narratives were unidirectional and closed; now, they are evolving towards dynamic and interactive directions. This shift is not just an innovation in form, but a rethinking of the essence of design and narrative, a deep exploration of aesthetics, cognition, and emotional connections by humans.</p>

            <h3>1. From "Content Follows Container" to "Container Serves Content": The Awakening of Design</h3>
            <p>In the field of digital design, the traditional "content follows container" model places predefined frameworks at the core, with content passively adapting to the container. While this design philosophy ensures visual uniformity, it also limits the flexibility and expressive power of design. With the increasing demands for user experience, a new design thinking is gradually emerging: "container serves content." This paradigm places content at the center of design, with containers dynamically adjusting according to the characteristics of the content and user needs, thus creating more vibrant and adaptable layouts.</p>
            <h4>1. Content is King: Redefining the Core of Typography</h4>
            <p>In traditional design, designers typically first determine the structure and size of the page, then fill the content into predefined frames. This approach simplifies the design process but leads to content rigidity. The "container serves content" concept, on the other hand, emphasizes the value and characteristics of content, encouraging designers to determine the shape and size of the container based on the essence of the content.</p>
            <h4>2. Technological Innovation: Flexible Grids and Responsive Design</h4>
            <p>The realization of the "container serves content" concept relies on technological support. Flexible grid systems and responsive design are key technologies. Technologies like CSS Grid and Flexbox enable containers to adjust dynamically according to the length and proportion of the content.</p>
            <h4>3. User Experience Upgrade: From Static to Dynamic Transition</h4>
            <p>The "container serves content" approach not only changes the form of layout but also profoundly affects user experience. Traditional static pages make users feel monotonous and boring, while dynamic and adaptive layouts can bring more immersive and interactive experiences.</p>

            <h3>2. From Flat to Stereoscopic: Evolution and Awakening of Design</h3>
            <p>In the field of design, flat and stereoscopic are not just visual style changes but a philosophical reflection on the essence of design. Flat design pursues ultimate simplification, stripping away unnecessary decorations, while stereoscopic design seeks balance between simplicity and complexity, giving design vitality and depth.</p>
            <h4>1. The Minimalist Beauty of Flat Design</h4>
            <p>The rise of flat design stems from the desire for clear information in the era of information explosion. However, excessive pursuit of minimalism may lead to the loss of warmth and emotion in design.</p>
            <h4>2. The Return and Innovation of Stereoscopic Design</h4>
            <p>Stereoscopic design retains the simplicity of flat design while using light, texture, and spatial layers to give the interface vitality and depth.</p>
            <h4>3. Technological Drive and Mindset Shift</h4>
            <p>The rise of stereoscopic design is inseparable from the development of new materials and technologies. 3D modeling and AR augmented reality technologies open up new creative spaces for designers.</p>

            <h3>3. From Static to Dynamic: Interactive Experiences Redefine Narrative Boundaries</h3>
            <p>The change in narrative methods is equally profound. Once, narratives were static and unidirectional, with creators determining the direction of the story and readers passively accepting. Today, the vigorous development of interactive technology transforms narrative into a dynamic story woven jointly by creators and audiences.</p>
            <h4>1. From Passive Acceptance to Active Participation</h4>
            <p>The revolutionary aspect of interactive experiences is that it partially returns the narrative initiative to the audience. Through choices, triggers, and explorations, users are no longer passive bystanders but co-creators of the story.</p>
            <h4>2. The Essence of Immersion Reconstructed</h4>
            <p>In interactive narratives, the source of immersion changes fundamentally. Realism no longer solely comes from the virtual worlds constructed by text but also from the emotional projections generated during user interactions.</p>

            <h3>4. The Future of Design and Narrative: From Form to Essence</h3>
            <p>In this era of digitalization, design and narrative are transcending mere form innovation and delving into the depths of human nature and emotion. Future design and narrative will undoubtedly move towards a more intelligent and humanized direction.</p>
