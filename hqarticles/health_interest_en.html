            <h2>Health Justice in the Digital Age: The Triple Challenges of Data Sovereignty, Climate Crisis, and Algorithmic Ethics</h2>
            
            <section>
                <h3>Introduction: Health as a Field of Systemic Power Mapping</h3>
                <p>In the 21st century, where techno-capitalism intersects with ecological crisis, health issues have evolved into a multidimensional political-economic proposition. Through critical analysis of the collusion between data colonialism, climate inequality, and algorithmic tyranny, this article reveals three new paradigms of contemporary health deprivation: (1) The capitalist alienation of life information; (2) The stratified distribution of environmental risks; (3) The computational discrimination of medical resources. This analytical framework not only transcends the boundaries of traditional public health research but also points to the possibility of reconstructing health justice in the era of digital civilization.</p>

                <h3>I. The Political Economy of Health Data: From Bioprivacy to Digital Labor</h3>
                
                <h4>1.1 The Discursive Construction and Substantive Deprivation of Data Ownership</h4>
                <p>A Foucauldian biopolitical analysis reveals that the struggle over health data is essentially an iteration of "biopower" in the digital age. Although regulations like GDPR formally recognize personal data rights, tech giants achieve substantive possession through three strategies: (1) Transforming user agreements into "voluntary exploitation" contracts (e.g., 23andMe's genetic data terms); (2) Constructing medical-tech-insurance data cartels (case: Google's Ascension project secretly obtaining 50 million electronic medical records); (3) Justifying data plunder with "medical progress" discourse (pharmaceutical companies saving $12 billion annually in R&D costs vs. zero compensation for data providers).</p>
                
                <h4>1.2 Dialectical Critique of Blockchain Solutions</h4>
                <p>While decentralized solutions like MediBloc are technically feasible, they face institutional exclusion by medical interest groups (the Korean case shows hospitals refusing to connect). A more fundamental contradiction lies in: When health data is tokenized as NFTs, it may exacerbate the "financialization of health" crisis—the accumulation of biological capital by the wealthy and the bankruptcy of health credit by the poor. This requires us to move beyond technological fixism and turn to data governance innovations guided by Ostrom's "commons" theory.</p>
                <p class="transition">The logic of health data exploitation is covertly coupled with environmental injustice: groups deprived of data value are often the primary victims of the climate crisis.</p>

                <h3>II. Climate Health Rights: From Environmental Justice to Biological Citizenship</h3>
                
                <h4>2.1 Spatial Pathology and Toxic Capitalism</h4>
                <p>Nick Shapiro's "slow violence" theory explains why residents of Louisiana's "Cancer Alley" have a life expectancy 15 years lower than the state average—petrochemical companies geographically distribute health risks through spatial racism. The Global South faces double exploitation: Bangladesh bears 40% of the water pollution from fast fashion but receives only 0.2% of brand profits.</p>
                
                <h4>2.2 Quantifying the Health Debt of Carbon Colonialism</h4>
                <p>Drawing on "tobacco litigation" experience, we should establish a "Carbon Giants Health Damage Index": (1) Allocating national medical expenditures according to corporate carbon emissions (calculations show ExxonMobil should bear 3.2% of U.S. asthma treatment costs); (2) Imposing a global health damage tax ($5.8 per ton of CO₂ could raise $278 billion annually for public health funds).</p>

                <h3>III. Algorithmic Tyranny: Cognitive Injustice in Medical AI</h3>
                
                <h4>3.1 The Socially Constructed Violence of Training Data</h4>
                <p>The "epistemic bias" of medical AI reflects Cathy O'Neil's "weapons of math destruction" logic:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Skin cancer diagnosis models have a 34% false-negative rate in Black populations (Nature 2023 study)</li>
                    <li>Obstetric risk prediction systems systematically underestimate danger coefficients for low-income pregnant women (NEJM 2022)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>3.2 Adversarial Machine Learning and Institutional Design</h4>
                <p>Brazil's "Algorithm Audit Citizen Jury" model offers insights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mandatory algorithm transparency: Medical institutions must disclose the demographic composition of training data</li>
                    <li>Establishing an "anti-discrimination test sandbox": All medical AI must pass sensitivity tests for marginalized groups</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Conclusion: Three Paradigm Shifts Toward Planetary Health Justice</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Epistemological Revolution</strong>: Redefining health as a tripartite bundle of rights—"life information rights, environmental survival rights, computational fairness rights"</li>
                    <li><strong>Institutional Innovation</strong>:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Establishing a Global Health Data Trust Fund (revenue feeds back into public healthcare)</li>
                            <li>Creating a "Health Damage Trade Sanctions Mechanism" under the WTO framework</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Technological Democratization</strong>: Implementing a "social-technical contract" for medical AI (R&D must include patient alliances, climate migrants, and other stakeholders)</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="conclusion">When the Arctic permafrost thaws to release ancient viruses while Silicon Valley elites use CRISPR to edit their own genes, the issue of health justice exposes the ultimate schism of human civilization. Only by incorporating data sovereignty, climate responsibility, and algorithmic ethics into a unified "Planetary Health Constitution" can we prevent digital utopia from evolving into a new form of health apartheid.</p>
