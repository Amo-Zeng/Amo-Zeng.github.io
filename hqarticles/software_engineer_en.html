            <h4>2.1 Balancing Technological Innovation and System Stability</h4>
            <p>Technological innovation is the engine of business development, but rapid iteration and frequent updates often mean compromising system stability. To find a balance between the two, technical teams need to establish a scientific evaluation mechanism. For example, using a "technical debt matrix" to categorize technical debt by impact scope and resolution difficulty, prioritizing the resolution of debts that affect core system functions and are easier to resolve. Additionally, leaving room for "error tolerance" in technological innovation allows controlled experimentation and timely review and optimization.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Assessing and Repaying Technical Debt</h4>
            <p>Assessing the pros and cons of technical debt requires considering potential benefits, risks, and repayment costs. Appropriate "debt" can accelerate product iteration and gain a market edge, but excessive debt can increase system maintenance difficulty and reduce code readability. Therefore, establishing a reasonable repayment plan is crucial. For example, repaying technical debt in stages, using automation tools to identify and resolve debts, or incorporating technical debt into the code review process to encourage developers to actively address debts. Additionally, introducing modular design and standardizing technology stacks can reduce the accumulation of technical debt and improve system maintainability.</p>
            <h4>2.3 Introducing New Technologies and Avoiding the "Debt Trap"</h4>
            <p>The introduction of new technologies often comes with new technical debt, such as learning costs, compatibility issues, and potential security risks. To avoid "paying for new technology," technical teams need to conduct thorough research and evaluation before introducing new technologies, understanding their advantages, disadvantages, applicable scenarios, and potential risks. Additionally, gradually introducing new technologies, choosing low-risk projects for pilot testing, and gradually promoting them after gaining experience are effective strategies to avoid accumulating technical debt. For example, through continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes, technical teams can more quickly identify and resolve issues, reducing the risk of introducing new technologies.</p>
