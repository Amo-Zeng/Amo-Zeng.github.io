            <h3>Technology Integration and Innovation: The New Frontier for Physiotherapy</h3>
            <p>Physiotherapists are actively adopting high-tech tools such as Virtual Reality (VR), robotic-assisted technology, and biofeedback systems to enhance treatment effectiveness and optimize patient experiences. VR provides a safe, controlled training environment, enabling patients to engage in rehabilitation exercises in a simulated setting. Robotic-assisted technology aids in precise muscle training and joint movements, helping patients regain functionality. Biofeedback systems, with their real-time monitoring capabilities, enable patients to better understand and regulate their physiological responses.</p>
