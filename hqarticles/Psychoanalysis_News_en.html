                <p>Every day, we scroll through TikTok, join Zoom meetings, buy NFTs or cryptocurrencies—behind these seemingly ordinary behaviors lies a silent spiritual transformation. Algorithms are no longer just tools but become weavers of desire; screens are no longer just interfaces but become mirror stages for the self; digital assets are no longer just virtual property but become proof of existence.</p>
                
                <p>Data reveals an undeniable reality: in 2023, global users spent an average of 6 hours and 49 minutes online daily, with social media occupying 2 hours and 27 minutes (DataReportal, 2023). Our cognitive patterns, emotional structures, and self-identity are being profoundly reconfigured by digital technology. This is not merely a change in habits but a major transformation of the human mental structure.</p>
                
                <p>This article will conduct a systematic analysis from the following three dimensions, integrating theories from psychoanalysis, media philosophy, and sociology:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The Algorithm Era</strong>: When desire is tamed and reshaped by data</li>
                    <li><strong>The Screen Era</strong>: When the self flows and fragments within interfaces</li>
                    <li><strong>The Symbol Era</strong>: When existence requires digital proof and confirmation</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>We ultimately need to answer: as technology increasingly becomes a "psychological exoskeleton" today, how can we safeguard the autonomy of the spirit and the fundamental value of humanity?</p>

                <h2>I. Algorithm: The Invisible Architect of Desire</h2>
                
                <h3>1.1 From "I desire, therefore I am" to "It recommends, therefore I watch"</h3>
                <p>Lacan once said: "Desire is the desire of the Other." In traditional society, this "Other" was the family, school, or social norms; in the digital age, the algorithm becomes the new "Big Other," sculpting the shape of our desires with data as its material.</p>
                
                <p>A 2023 TikTok user study shows that 78% of users admit their interest preferences are directly influenced by algorithm recommendations (Forrester Research, 2023). More interestingly, research on Xiaohongshu's "seed planting" mechanism indicates that users generate an average of 3.2 unplanned purchases daily due to algorithm recommendations. This is a new form of "desire colonization"—we still express desires, but the source of desire has quietly shifted.</p>
                
                <p>Philosopher Byung-Chul Han warns in <em>The Transparency Society</em>: Big data and algorithms are leading to a "terror of sameness," where individual differences are smoothed over, and desires become standardized and predictable.</p>
                
                <h3>1.2 The Triple Effects of Mechanized Desire</h3>
                
                <h4>① Cognitive Solidification and Filter Bubble Formation</h4>
                <p>Algorithms, by reinforcing preferences, trap us in "filter bubbles." A 2023 MIT study shows that the polarization of political views among social media users has increased by 47% compared to 2016, closely related to recommendation mechanisms.</p>
                
                <h4>② Time Compression and Instant Gratification Loop</h4>
                <p>Short videos and dopamine mechanisms reconfigure the temporal dimension of desire. Stanford University's Behavior Lab notes that the average attention span of short video users has decreased from 12 seconds in 2015 to 8 seconds in 2023. We increasingly pursue "instant gratification," eroding our capacity for delayed satisfaction.</p>
                
                <h4>③ Value Simplification and Scoring-ism</h4>
                <p>"Likes" and "shares" become the new metrics of value. Internal Instagram research reveals that content receiving 1000 likes gets 15 times more exposure from the algorithm, simplifying aesthetic and ethical judgments into quantifiable indicators.</p>
                
                <h3>1.3 Escape Routes: Rebuilding the Subjectivity of Desire</h3>
                <p>To escape the dilemma of being "defined by algorithms," we need to act on three fronts: cognition, behavior, and systems:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cognitive Awakening: Develop Algorithm Critical Literacy</strong><br>
                    Regularly practice "algorithm fasting"—set aside 2 hours weekly to turn off personalized recommendations; use non-mainstream search engines (e.g., DuckDuckGo) to access non-customized information streams.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Behavioral Adjustment: Reclaim Information Autonomy</strong><br>
                    Advocate for maintaining an appropriate ratio (e.g., 3:7) between "active searching" and "passive receiving"; set up "interest diversity reminders" to explore three new fields monthly.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>System Suggestions: Promote Algorithm Transparency and Ethics</strong><br>
                    Advocate for "algorithm explanation rights" legislation, allowing users to know the recommendation logic; develop user-adjustable recommendation parameter tools, returning some control to people.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>II. Screen: The Fragmentation and Performance of the Self in the Interface</h2>
                
                <h3>2.1 The Mirror Self: From Real Self to Screen Self</h3>
                <p>Psychologist Winnicott proposed the "transitional space" theory, suggesting the self develops in a "potential space" between reality and fantasy. Today, screens become the largest digital potential space—we are both in it and outside it.</p>
                
                <p>Remote work studies show that 72% of employees use virtual backgrounds in video conferences, and 65% deliberately adjust camera angles (Microsoft Work Trend Index, 2023). This manipulation of self-image reflects that the screen has become a new "mirror of the self."</p>
                
                <p>Zoom research found that employees using virtual backgrounds actually report lower job satisfaction (18% lower) but higher self-efficacy scores (23% higher). This indicates that while the screen self may boost short-term confidence, it also exacerbates alienation from the real self.</p>
                
                <h3>2.2 The Triple Dilemma of Screen Cognition</h3>
                
                <h4>① Performative Existence</h4>
                <p>Goffman's "dramaturgy" becomes strikingly evident in digital interfaces. LinkedIn's 2023 report shows remote workers smile 40% more frequently in video meetings than offline, with 25% greater variation in tone, indicating stronger performativity in self-presentation.</p>
                
                <h4>② Self-Fragmentation</h4>
                <p>Multi-window, multi-tasking leads to dispersed attention and sense of self. Cognitive psychology research indicates a significant negative correlation (r=-0.67) between screen-switching frequency and self-cognitive coherence.</p>
                
                <h4>③ Feedback Dependency</h4>
                <p>Self-worth increasingly relies on external digital feedback. Research finds that for users spending over 3 hours daily on social media, 63% of their self-worth comes from online interactions like likes and comments.</p>
                
                <h3>2.3 Rebuilding Integration: Towards a Balance Between Digital Self and Real Self</h3>
                <p>To mitigate the self-fragmentation caused by screens, we need to make the following efforts:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Human-Centric Interface Design</strong><br>
                    Promote "authentic mode," encouraging the display of real environments; add "emotional buffer periods" to video meetings—reserve 3 minutes before and after for psychological transition.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Proactive Personal Behavioral Adjustments</strong><br>
                    Establish "screen rituals": 5 minutes of mindfulness before starting, 5 minutes of reflection after shutting down; practice a "digital Sabbath," setting aside half a day weekly away from screens.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Organizational Support and Cultural Building</strong><br>
                    Companies can offer "Real Self Workshops" to help employees distinguish between screen self and real self; develop team psychological safety assessment tools to regularly evaluate psychological stress in digital communication.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>III. NFTs and Digital Identity: The Symbolic Proof of Existence</h2>
                
                <h3>3.1 From "I possess" to "I prove I exist"</h3>
                <p>2023 NFT market analysis shows that 70% of buyers never use the digital assets they purchase. This phenomenon points to existential anxiety in the digital age—we need external symbols to prove our existence.</p>
                
                <p>Freud's concept of "fetishism" takes on new meaning here: traditional fetishism compensates for a lack, while digital fetishism (e.g., NFT collecting) confirms virtual identity and anchors a sense of existence. Jean Baudrillard's "sign value" from <em>The Consumer Society</em> is exemplified here—people consume not use value but symbolic meaning.</p>
                
                <p>Bored Ape Yacht Club research shows 89% of holders use it as a social avatar, while only 12% deeply engage with the community. This indicates digital assets are used more for "identity performance" than practical use.</p>
                
                <h3>3.2 The Triple Paradox of Digital Existence</h3>
                
                <h4>① The Virtual vs. Real Paradox</h4>
                <p>Blockchain creates "digital scarcity," but its essence remains a virtual object that can be infinitely replicated. This "authenticity" bestowed by technology is itself a construct.</p>
                
                <h4>② The Tension Between Symbol and Value</h4>
                <p>NFT market value often detaches from use value, inflated in symbolic exchange, reflecting what Lacan called the "Symbolic Order" overlaying the "Real."</p>
                
                <h4>③ Identity Alienation and Self-Objectification</h4>
                <p>When we define ourselves through digital assets, alienation occurs between the real self and digital identity, trapping the sense of existence in a cycle of "Other-confirmation."</p>
                
                <h3>3.3 Returning to Authenticity: Rebuilding Existence Beyond Symbols</h3>
                <p>To overcome dependence on digital proof, we should:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Value Reassessment and Practical Shift</strong><br>
                    Develop "Digital Asset Use Value Assessment Tools" to guide rational consumption; establish a multi-dimensional existence assessment system (e.g., relationships, creation, experiences).</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Personal Awakening and Moderation</strong><br>
                    Practice "digital decluttering," regularly clearing unused digital assets; maintain an "existence diary," recording non-digital life experiences.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Sociocultural and Educational Support</strong><br>
                    Promote "digital existence literacy" education to help the public understand the limitations of symbolic proof; incorporate "digital health" into public mental health agendas, monitoring digital dependency phenomena.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion: Humanistic Persistence in the Digital Torrent</h2>
                
                <p>As algorithms, screens, and symbols increasingly form the foundational architecture of our mental lives, rather than rejecting technology, we should learn to coexist with it while remaining vigilant:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Be a "Conscious Traveler" in the Digital World</strong>: Recognize the constructed nature of technology, maintaining reflective and critical abilities;</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultivate Dual Resilience in "Digital-Reality"</strong>: Be able to immerse in the digital torrent yet return to life's authenticity;</li>
                    <li><strong>Guard Irreplaceable Embodied Existence</strong>: Beyond symbolic consumption, cherish experiences that need no proof—a conversation, a landscape, or genuine affection.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Technology should expand, not replace, humanity; assist, not dominate, the mind. True spiritual freedom lies not in rejecting the exoskeleton, but in always remembering: we wear technology, not technology wears us.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <p>As Lacan said: "Desire is the essence of existence, but true desire is the constant questioning of desire, not its simple satisfaction." In the digital age, this questioning is more urgent than ever.</p>
                </blockquote>
