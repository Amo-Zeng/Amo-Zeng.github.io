            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>With the constant evolution of technology, the .NET ecosystem is also rapidly developing, especially with the rise of .NET Core and .NET 5/6, making the future positioning of .NET Framework a topic of great interest. Although emerging technologies are driving the industry forward, will .NET Framework be completely phased out? Or will it continue to play a unique role in certain specific scenarios? This article will delve into the role and positioning of .NET Framework in modern development, analyzing its current status and future development in areas such as ongoing support and maintenance, specific scenario applications, and technical integration.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Ongoing Support and Maintenance</h2>
            <h3>Microsoft's Strategic Commitment</h3>
            <p>Microsoft's ongoing support and maintenance of .NET Framework are key factors in its continued role in modern development. Despite .NET Core and .NET 5/6 becoming the mainstream development platforms, Microsoft has not abandoned support for .NET Framework. Instead, Microsoft has explicitly committed to providing long-term technical support for .NET Framework, including regular security updates and bug fixes, to ensure the stability and security of existing systems. This commitment not only provides security for existing .NET Framework applications but also offers enterprises ample time and flexibility during the transition to new platforms.</p>
            <h3>Compatibility Support for New .NET Versions</h3>
            <p>When designing new versions of the .NET platform (such as .NET 5 and .NET 6), Microsoft has thoroughly considered compatibility with .NET Framework. By providing compatibility layers and cross-platform support, developers can gradually migrate to the new .NET platform while preserving their existing code. This compatibility support not only reduces the complexity and risk of migration but also allows enterprises to adopt modern development tools and technologies without interrupting business operations. This gradual transition strategy provides developers with more choices, enabling them to embrace the new .NET ecosystem while retaining their existing investments.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Applications in Specific Scenarios</h2>
            <h3>Irreplaceability of Windows Forms and WPF</h3>
            <p>In the field of desktop application development, especially with technologies like Windows Forms and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), .NET Framework still plays an irreplaceable role. These technologies have deep technical accumulations and extensive application bases on the Windows platform, particularly in enterprise-level desktop application development. .NET Framework provides rich class libraries, mature toolchains, and powerful control support, enabling developers to efficiently build and maintain complex desktop applications. Although modern development platforms offer more cross-platform solutions, in specific Windows ecosystems, .NET Framework remains the preferred choice for many enterprises.</p>
            <h3>Continuous Maintenance of Legacy Systems</h3>
            <p>Many enterprises rely on legacy systems built on .NET Framework, which have been running in production environments for years and have accumulated a large amount of business data and logic. Migrating these systems to new platforms requires significant time and resources and may face compatibility issues and performance challenges. Therefore, .NET Framework still plays an important role in maintaining these legacy systems. With ongoing technical support, enterprises can ensure the stable operation of these systems and gradually upgrade the technology at an appropriate time. This strategy not only protects enterprises' existing investments but also provides a flexible path for technical evolution.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Technical Integration</h2>
            <h3>Seamless Integration of .NET Framework and .NET Core/5/6</h3>
            <p>The technical integration between .NET Framework and .NET Core/5/6 provides developers with a clear transition path. Microsoft has provided compatibility layers, migration tools, and detailed documentation to help developers gradually migrate to the modern .NET ecosystem. This technical integration not only lowers the technical barriers to migration but also ensures system stability and reliability. Developers can retain their existing code and gradually introduce new technologies and tools, achieving a smooth transition. This integration strategy ensures that .NET Framework and the new platforms are no longer disjointed but complement each other, jointly building a more powerful and flexible .NET ecosystem.</p>
            <h3>Developer Transition Strategies</h3>
            <p>For developers, the path from .NET Framework to .NET Core/5/6 is clear and controllable. Microsoft has provided detailed migration guidelines, tools, and best practices to help developers understand the features and advantages of new technologies and gradually adapt to the modern .NET ecosystem. This transition path not only improves development efficiency but also provides developers with more choices and flexibility. Whether fully migrating to the new platform or adopting a hybrid development model, developers can choose the most suitable development strategy based on the actual project needs. This flexibility enables developers to maintain competitiveness in constantly changing technological environments.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Although the rise of .NET Core and .NET 5/6 has brought significant changes to the .NET ecosystem, .NET Framework still plays an important role and has a clear positioning in modern development. Its irreplaceability in specific scenarios, ongoing technical support and maintenance, and seamless integration with new technologies ensure its continued value in future development environments. As technology continues to evolve, .NET Framework will continue to provide developers with a stable and reliable development platform, ensuring the continuous operation and upgrading of existing systems.</p>
            <p>Through the analysis in this article, we can clearly see the important position of .NET Framework in modern development and why it can maintain its persistence in the face of new technological challenges. Whether in maintaining enterprise-level applications or meeting specific desktop development needs, .NET Framework will continue to provide critical technical support for developers and enterprises. Enterprises and developers can choose and utilize .NET Framework based on their actual needs, ensuring it continues to play a key role in future business development.</p>
