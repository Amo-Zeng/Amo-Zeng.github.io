            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Galactic chemical evolution is not just a branch of astronomy; it is a key link in understanding the distribution and evolution of matter in the universe. By deeply studying the formation, diffusion, and evolution of chemical elements within galaxies, we can uncover the complex structures and dynamic processes of the cosmos. This article explores galactic chemical evolution from three unique and innovative perspectives: the interaction between dark matter and chemical elements, galaxy collisions and chemical restructuring, and the chemical fingerprint of extragalactic material.</p>

            <h3>Interaction of Dark Matter with Chemical Elements</h3>
            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>Although dark matter does not emit or absorb light directly, it makes up the vast majority of the universe's total matter (about 85%). Its nature remains a mystery, but its gravitational effects play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies. Traditionally, the chemical evolution of galaxies has focused on changes in element abundances in visible matter (like stars, interstellar gas). However, the existence, distribution, and movement of dark matter could indirectly influence the distribution and evolution of chemical elements within galaxies through gravitational effects.</p>
            <h4>Theoretical Models</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Formation of Dark Matter Halos</strong>: In the early stages of galaxy formation, dark matter collapses gravitationally to form dark matter halos, which are cradles for galaxy formation. The structural features of dark matter halos (such as density distribution, rotation speed) directly affect the gas distribution and star formation within galaxies. For example, the density distribution of dark matter halos can alter the temperature and pressure of gas within the galaxy, thereby affecting the rate and efficiency of star formation, and consequently, the production and diffusion of new elements (like oxygen, carbon, iron).</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Effects of Dark Matter</strong>: The movement of dark matter halos (like rotation and oscillation) might influence the distribution of chemical elements within a galaxy. Through simulation studies, the rotation and oscillation modes of dark matter halos can alter gas flows within galaxies, affecting the mixing and diffusion of chemical elements. In regions with high rotation speeds, gas flow accelerates, potentially leading to faster mixing of newly produced metals throughout the galaxy, resulting in a more uniform distribution of chemical element abundances.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Observational Evidence</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Element Abundance Within Galaxies</strong>: By observing the metallicity and age distribution of stars in different galaxies, researchers have found that the metallicity is usually higher at the centers of galaxies and lower in the outskirts. This phenomenon might be related to the density distribution of dark matter halos, where a high-density dark matter halo at the center could more easily form stars with high metallicity.</li>
                <li><strong>Homogeneity in Galaxy Clusters</strong>: Galaxies within galaxy clusters typically have relatively uniform metallicity distributions, which is associated with the collective gravitational effects of dark matter halos within the cluster. Dark matter halos, through gravitational interactions, cause metals to be evenly distributed throughout the galaxy cluster.</li>
            </ul>
