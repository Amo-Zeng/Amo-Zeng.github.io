            <h2>Multiple Dilemmas in the Tide of Globalization: Digital Divide, Cultural Identity, and Ecological Modernization</h2>
            <p>In the tide of globalization, human society is undergoing unprecedented changes. The free flow of information, the global allocation of capital, and the cross-border movement of goods have increasingly integrated the world economy into a whole. However, behind this seemingly glamorous globalization feast, there are hidden digital divide exacerbation, cultural identity crises, and the myths of ecological modernization. These three dilemmas not only intertwine but also profoundly affect global social equity and justice, cultural diversity, and ecological sustainability.</p>

            <h3>I. The Digital Divide: Increasing Inequality Behind Globalization</h3>
            <p>Globalization has driven the rapid development of the internet and digital technology, but the benefits of technology have not been universally shared. Developed countries, with their technological and capital advantages, dominate in international competition, while developing countries are at a disadvantage in the international division of labor. This technological hegemony not only exacerbates global inequality but also deepens the digital divide.</p>
            <p>The digital divide not only exists between different countries and regions but also increasingly manifests within the same country. There are significant differences in digital access levels between urban and rural areas, and among different income groups. This internal divide is becoming a key obstacle to developing countries' participation in the global digital economy. The technological monopolies of multinational tech giants further entrench this inequality, hindering the development space of small and medium-sized enterprises and developing countries.</p>
            <p>In the context of globalization, bridging the digital divide requires the joint efforts of the international community. Developed countries should take on more responsibility by transferring technology and providing financial support to help developing countries improve their digital capabilities. The international community should promote the establishment of fair digital economy rules to safeguard the rights of developing countries and small and medium-sized enterprises. Only by building an inclusive digital economy system can we truly achieve the inclusiveness of globalization, allowing the benefits of technological progress to benefit all of humanity.</p>

            <h3>II. Cultural Identity and Identity Anxiety: Cultural Dilemmas in Globalization</h3>
            <p>Globalization is not only the integration of economies and technologies but also the exchange and collision of cultures. With the rapid spread of information and frequent cross-border movement of people, cultural interactions and integrations have become more intense than ever. However, this cultural exchange is not always harmonious; cultural identity and identity anxiety have become more pronounced in the tide of globalization.</p>
            <p>Cultural conflicts have become more prominent during globalization. The widespread dissemination of Western culture has caused many non-Western countries to face cultural erosion, as local cultures gradually disappear in the tide of globalization, leading to the rise of cultural protectionism. The increase in immigration and cross-border marriages has left many people living between two or more cultures, bringing a rich life experience but also identity anxiety.</p>
            <p>The rise of cultural protectionism, while protecting the inheritance of local cultures to some extent, may also lead to cultural closure and exclusion. Building an inclusive multicultural identity system is an important way to address globalization challenges. Countries should find a balance between cultural exchange and cultural protection, promoting the coexistence and development of cultural diversity. Through education, cultural exchange, and policy support, people's understanding and acceptance of multiculturalism can be enhanced, reducing cultural conflicts and identity anxiety.</p>

            <h3>III. The Myth of Ecological Modernization: Globalization's Green Narrative and Environmental Crisis</h3>
            <p>Environmental issues have been given unprecedented importance in the tide of globalization, but are we trapped by a myth called "ecological modernization"? This theory holds that through technological innovation and corporate self-regulation, humanity can achieve environmental protection while continuing to develop the economy. However, this optimistic assumption overlooks the deep-rooted causes of environmental crises in the process of globalization.</p>
            <p>The environmental costs of globalization are often obscured. Developed countries have outsourced high-pollution, high-energy-consuming production processes to developing countries through industrial transfers, achieving environmental improvements domestically while加重全球生态系统的负担加重 global ecological burden. The narrative of ecological modernization constructs an illusion of green growth, masking the structural roots of environmental problems. Technological innovation is important, but without changing the growth-oriented development model, environmental improvements can only be partial and temporary.</p>
            <p>The limitations of the green narrative are increasingly evident in global governance. Disputes over responsibility allocation in global climate negotiations, the establishment of green trade barriers, and the困境 of international environmental organizations reveal the deep contradictions in global environmental governance. Redefining environmental issues is key to breaking the myth of ecological modernization. We need to recognize that environmental crises are fundamentally a problem of development models, not just simple management or technical issues.</p>

            <h3>IV. The Interweaving of Multiple Dilemmas and the Way Out for Globalization</h3>
            <p>The digital divide, cultural identity crisis, and myth of ecological modernization brought by globalization are not just individual issues but interconnected and interrelated global challenges. The digital divide exacerbates social inequality, the crisis of cultural identity affects social harmony, and the myth of ecological modernization obscures the deep-rooted causes of environmental crises. Facing these dilemmas, global society needs to adopt comprehensive strategies.</p>
            <p>In the field of digital technology, we need to promote technological innovation and fairness, bridge the digital divide, and build an inclusive digital economy system. In the cultural field, we need to promote cultural diversity, build an inclusive multicultural identity system, and reduce cultural conflicts and identity anxiety. In the environmental field, we need to transcend the myth of ecological modernization, redefine environmental issues, change the growth-oriented development model, and establish a more equitable and sustainable global environmental governance system.</p>
            <p>The way out for globalization lies in building a fairer, more inclusive, and sustainable world. This requires the joint efforts of the international community, transcending narrow national interests, and promoting cooperation in various fields with a more open and inclusive attitude. Only by combining technological innovation and fairness, cultural exchange and protection, environmental governance, and sustainable development can we truly achieve the inclusiveness and sustainability of globalization, building a fairer and more open global society together.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The digital divide, cultural identity and identity anxiety, and the myth of ecological modernization brought by globalization are challenges we all face together. By combining technological innovation and fairness, cultural exchange and protection, environmental governance, and sustainable development, we can enhance people's understanding and acceptance of multiculturalism, reduce cultural conflicts and identity anxiety, promote cultural identity and social harmony, and achieve sustainable development through globalization. In this era of multicultural coexistence, we need to face cultural differences with a more open and inclusive attitude, working together to build a harmonious and diverse global cultural identity system.</p>
