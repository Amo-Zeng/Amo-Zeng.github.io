            <h3>1. Definition and Classification of Smart Responsive Biomaterials</h3>
            <p>Smart responsive biomaterials are materials that can sense and respond to changes in the external environment, thereby altering their properties. Based on different response mechanisms, these materials can be classified into the following categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature-responsive materials:</strong> The properties of these materials change with temperature. For example, certain polymers undergo phase transitions at specific temperatures, altering their solubility or mechanical properties.</li>
                <li><strong>pH-responsive materials:</strong> These materials are sensitive to changes in pH and are often used in drug delivery systems to release drugs in specific pH environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Electric field-responsive materials:</strong> These materials deform or change their conductivity under the influence of an electric field, and are used in neural and muscle tissue engineering.</li>
                <li><strong>Light-responsive materials:</strong> These materials undergo chemical or physical changes under light, and are used for light-controlled drug release and light-controlled cell behavior regulation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Applications of Smart Responsive Biomaterials in Tissue Engineering</h3>
            <h4>2.1 Intelligent Tissue Scaffolds</h4>
            <p>The application of smart responsive biomaterials in tissue scaffolds is an important direction in tissue engineering. Traditional tissue scaffolds mainly rely on physical structures to support cell growth and tissue regeneration, while intelligent responsive scaffolds can automatically adjust their properties based on changes in the surrounding environment, thereby better supporting cell growth and tissue regeneration.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature-responsive scaffolds:</strong> For example, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) is a temperature-responsive polymer that transitions from hydrophilic to hydrophobic above 32Â°C, altering its physical properties. This material can be used to manufacture tissue scaffolds that adjust their porosity based on body temperature, promoting cell migration and proliferation.</li>
                <li><strong>pH-responsive scaffolds:</strong> In inflammatory or tumor environments, pH levels typically decrease. Therefore, developing pH-responsive scaffolds can achieve targeted drug release. For example, using pH-sensitive polymers to encapsulate anti-inflammatory drugs, the drugs will automatically release when the pH around the scaffold decreases, reducing inflammation and improving the success rate of tissue regeneration.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.2 Intelligent Drug Delivery Systems</h4>
            <p>The application of smart responsive biomaterials in drug delivery systems also shows great potential. By designing materials that respond to specific environmental changes, precise drug release can be achieved, improving treatment efficacy and reducing side effects.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>pH-responsive drug delivery systems:</strong> In the gastrointestinal tract, pH levels vary in different regions. Developing pH-responsive drug delivery systems can release drugs in specific pH environments, improving drug bioavailability. For example, using pH-sensitive polymers to encapsulate anticancer drugs, the drugs will automatically release when they reach the tumor site (lower pH), improving treatment efficacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Temperature-responsive drug delivery systems:</strong> In some cases, temperature changes can serve as a trigger for drug release. For example, using temperature-responsive polymers to encapsulate drugs, the drugs will automatically release when the local temperature increases, suitable for use in conjunction with local hyperthermia therapy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.3 Intelligent Regulation of Cell Behavior</h4>
            <p>Smart responsive biomaterials can also be used to regulate cell behavior, such as cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. By designing materials that respond to specific environmental changes, precise regulation of cell behavior can be achieved, promoting tissue regeneration.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Electric field-responsive materials:</strong> In neural tissue engineering, electric field-responsive materials can be used to guide the growth direction of nerve cells. For example, scaffolds made from conductive polymers can guide the growth of nerve cells under the influence of an electric field, promoting neural tissue regeneration.</li>
                <li><strong>Light-responsive materials:</strong> In light-controlled cell behavior regulation, light-responsive materials can be used for non-invasive regulation of cell behavior. For example, scaffolds made from light-sensitive polymers can change their surface properties under light, promoting cell adhesion and proliferation.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cardiovascular diseases:</strong> By differentiating iPSCs into cardiomyocytes, myocardial tissue sheets can be constructed to repair damage after a heart attack. Additionally, they can be used to study the mechanisms of heart disease and drug screening.</li>
                <li><strong>Neurodegenerative diseases:</strong> iPSCs can differentiate into neurons and glial cells to repair neural damage in diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. These cells can also be used to establish disease models, accelerating the development of new drugs.</li>
                <li><strong>Orthopedic diseases:</strong> By differentiating iPSCs into osteoblasts and chondrocytes, bone and cartilage tissues can be constructed to treat fractures, arthritis, and other orthopedic diseases. These tissues not only promote healing at the injury site but also reduce surgical risks and recovery time.</li>
                <li><strong>Skin repair:</strong> iPSCs can differentiate into epidermal and dermal cells to treat burns, chronic wounds, and other skin injuries. These cells can promote wound healing, reduce scar formation, and improve the patient's quality of life.</li>
            </ul>
