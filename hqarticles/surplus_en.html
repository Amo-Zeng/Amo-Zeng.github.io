            <h2>Environmental and Sustainable Development Perspectives</h2>
            <p>One often overlooked cost of trade surplus is the environmental cost. Many countries achieve trade surplus by exporting large quantities of pollution-intensive products, which usually leads to severe domestic environmental damage. Policymakers should consider incorporating environmental costs into economic decisions, using methods such as environmental taxes and emission trading systems, to encourage businesses to take on environmental protection responsibilities while pursuing economic benefits.</p>

            <h2>Technological Innovation and Competitiveness Perspectives</h2>
            <p>Relying on trade surplus for a long time may weaken a country's motivation for technological innovation. Policymakers should encourage diversified economic development, using measures such as tax incentives and R&D subsidies, to stimulate businesses to explore and innovate in new technologies and products, thereby enhancing the country's overall competitiveness.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Social Welfare and Income Distribution Perspectives</h2>
            <p>Trade surplus may also exacerbate domestic income distribution inequality. Policymakers need to implement fairer income distribution policies, ensuring that the benefits brought by trade surplus reach a wider population through balanced layouts of public services such as education, healthcare, and social security, thereby improving the overall level of social welfare.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>As a complex economic indicator, the impact of trade surplus goes beyond economic growth. By considering environmental and sustainable development, technological innovation and competitiveness, and social welfare and income distribution perspectives, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the true impact of trade surplus and develop more balanced and sustainable development strategies.</p>
