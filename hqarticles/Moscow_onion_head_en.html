            <h2>The Green Rebirth of Onion Domes: The Renewal of Ancient Architectural Icons in Sustainable Development</h2>
            <p>The "onion domes" churches in Moscow, with their unique dome shapes and profound cultural heritage, are not only gems of Russian architectural art but also shared cultural heritage of humanity. However, after centuries of wear and tear, these ancient buildings are facing dual challenges from physical deterioration and environmental pollution. How to preserve their historical charm while imbuing them with modern energy-saving and environmentally friendly properties has become a common challenge for contemporary architects and environmental experts. Through the integration of modern eco-friendly materials and advanced construction technologies, the onion domes churches are undergoing a magnificent green rebirth.</p>

            <h3>I. Application of Eco-friendly Materials: New Vitality for Ancient Buildings</h3>
            <p>In the restoration and renovation of onion domes churches, the selection of eco-friendly materials is crucial. Traditional building materials such as stone, wood, and metal, while carrying profound historical value, are easily affected by weathering and corrosion during long-term use. Modern eco-friendly materials, such as high-performance concrete, composite materials, and nano-coatings, not only outperform in durability but also significantly reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions.</p>
            <p>For example, high-performance concrete can be used for the repair of church foundations and walls, ensuring long-term stability with its excellent mechanical properties and durability. Composite materials can be used for the repair of onion domes, offering lightweight yet superior insulation and soundproofing properties, thus greatly enhancing the building's energy efficiency.</p>

            <h3>II. Inclusion of Advanced Technologies: The Perfect Combination of Intelligence and Energy Efficiency</h3>
            <p>The introduction of modern construction technologies has injected new vitality into the restoration and renovation of onion domes churches. Smart Building Management Systems (BMS) can monitor building energy consumption in real-time, precisely controlling air conditioning, lighting, and heating systems to minimize energy waste. Additionally, the application of solar panels provides the church with clean renewable energy, further reducing reliance on traditional energy sources.</p>
            <p>The integration of green building design concepts also brings new possibilities to onion domes churches. By optimizing natural lighting and ventilation design, the church reduces its reliance on external energy sources; the introduction of rainwater collection systems and green roofs not only enhances resource utilization efficiency but also improves the ecological environment around the building.</p>

            <h3>III. Practices of Sustainable Development: Harmony Between the Ancient and the Modern</h3>
            <p>The green rebirth of onion domes churches is not merely an environmental renovation but a vivid practice of sustainable development. By introducing modern eco-friendly materials and advanced technologies, these ancient buildings not only preserve their historical charm but also rejuvenate in contemporary society.</p>
            <p>For instance, onion domes churches can serve as exemplars of green architecture, showcasing the principles and technologies of sustainable development to the public. By hosting environmental lectures and training activities, these churches can attract more visitors and spread environmental awareness within the community, promoting the adoption of green lifestyles.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the successful experience of onion domes churches also provides valuable references for the restoration and renovation of other historical buildings. By sharing technical solutions and practical experiences, more historical buildings can find a balance between preservation and sustainable development, achieving harmony between the ancient and the modern.</p>
