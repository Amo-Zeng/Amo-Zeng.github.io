                <p>Galaxy clusters are the largest and most gravitationally bound structures in the universe, with masses ranging from \(10^{14}\) to \(10^{15}\) solar masses. They contain not only hundreds to thousands of galaxies but also diffuse hot gas (the intracluster medium, ICM), dark matter, and various cosmic objects such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and potential primordial black holes (PBHs). Current astrophysical research is undergoing a profound transformation from analyzing single components to understanding systems as a whole. Galaxy clusters provide a unique and comprehensive prototype for studying complex cosmic systems with multiple components and coupled processes. This article aims to explore the core characteristics and key roles of galaxy clusters as complex systems from multiple perspectives, including material composition, energy feedback, chemical evolution, and structure formation, emphasizing their significance as "cosmic complex system laboratories."</p>

                <h3>I. Material Composition and Hierarchical Structure: The Multifaceted Foundation of Complex Systems</h3>
                <p>The material composition of galaxy clusters epitomizes the complexity of cosmic structures. Their visible matter primarily consists of galaxies (approximately 1%) and ICM (about 9%), while invisible dark matter constitutes about 90% of the total mass, dominating the gravitational dynamics of the entire system. As the main form of ordinary matter in clusters, the ICM has temperatures as high as \(10^7\)–\(10^8\) K, and its spatial distribution and thermodynamic state can be revealed through X-ray radiation.</p>
                <p>Hierarchical structure is the fundamental mode of galaxy cluster formation. Through continuous accretion of surrounding matter and merger events, clusters continually accumulate mass and energy, forming a typical "core–periphery" gradient structure. This structural evolution not only records the growth history of large-scale cosmic structures but also highlights the critical position of galaxy clusters in connecting galaxies and the cosmic web.</p>

                <h3>II. Energy Flow and Feedback Mechanisms: Key Aspects of Systemic Self-Regulation</h3>
                <p>Galaxy clusters are not static; significant energy exchange and redistribution occur continuously within them. Gravitational energy is converted into thermal and turbulent energy during merger events, while AGN inject enormous energy into the ICM via jets and outflows, regulating its thermal state and suppressing excessive star formation—a mechanism known as "AGN feedback." Additionally, supernova explosions, galactic motions, and potential PBH accretion processes also contribute to the system's energy cycle.</p>
                <p>These feedback mechanisms achieve overall system stability through nonlinear interactions, exhibiting typical complex system behavior: local disturbances (e.g., a single AGN outburst) can trigger global responses (e.g., suppressing cooling flows throughout the cluster), demonstrating tight coupling and co-evolution among subsystems.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>III. Chemical Evolution and Element Enrichment: Galaxy Clusters as "Cosmic Chemical Engines"</h3>
                <p>The chemical evolution of galaxy clusters further reflects their systemic functionality. By continuously accumulating metal elements expelled by galaxies or introduced into the ICM via AGN feedback, the ICM becomes one of the most metal-rich environments in the universe. These metal elements, produced by stellar nucleosynthesis and transferred to the ICM through various feedback processes, constitute a massive material recycling system.</p>
                <p>This galactic-scale "chemical engine" not only records the history of element formation since cosmic reionization but also highlights the functional synergy among various components (stars, galaxies, AGN, ICM) in element production, mixing, and distribution. Therefore, galaxy clusters are not merely gravitationally dominated mass assemblages but also crucial hubs for material recycling and energy flow on cosmic scales.</p>

                <h3>IV. Multi-Messenger Detection and the Paradigm of Systems Science Research</h3>
                <p>With advancements in observational technologies across X-rays (e.g., Chandra, XMM-Newton), optical (e.g., SDSS, Subaru), radio (e.g., SKA, LOFAR), and gravitational waves, galaxy cluster research has entered the multi-messenger era. Data from different wavebands collectively reveal the multi-dimensional physical properties of clusters, including the thermal and non-thermal components of the ICM, galactic dynamics, dark matter distribution, and magnetic field structures.</p>
                <p>In this context, the concept of systems science provides a new framework for understanding galaxy clusters. Clusters can be viewed as dynamic networks formed by multiple components coupled through nonlinear interactions, whose macroscopic behaviors (e.g., thermal equilibrium, chemical distribution, morphological evolution) arise from the synergy and competition among microscopic components. Particularly, the "<strong>population fingerprint</strong>" method—inferring system states through integrated spectra or statistical features—marks a paradigm shift from individual to collective cognition, offering a powerful tool for revealing emergent behaviors.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>V. Summary and Outlook: Toward a Systematic Galaxy Cluster Cosmology</h3>
                <p>As the largest gravitationally bound systems in the universe, galaxy clusters bring together ordinary and dark matter, high-energy physical processes, and chemical enrichment history, serving as natural prototypes for studying cosmic complex systems. Processes such as hierarchical structure formation, energy feedback cycles, galaxy-ICM interactions, and element redistribution collectively shape a dynamic, self-regulating, multi-component coupled macrocosmic laboratory.</p>
                <p>The major <strong>innovation</strong in current research lies in no longer dissecting clusters into isolated components but instead focusing on <strong>functional synergy</strong> and <strong>systemic emergence</strong>, highlighting their holistic significance as "<strong>prototypes of cosmic complex systems</strong>." Future research needs to further integrate multi-band observations and numerical simulations, particularly in areas like AGN feedback, turbulent mixing, non-thermal processes, and the potential roles of primordial black holes, to deepen our understanding of material and energy cycles within these systems. Only by treating galaxy clusters as organic wholes can we truly unveil their nature as cosmic complex systems and thereby understand the formation and evolution of cosmic structures—this is the most critical chapter facing modern astrophysics.</p>
