            <h2>Introduction: Robot Globalization as a "Critical Event" in Civilizational Transformation</h2>
            <p>Driven by both <span class="theory-term">technological accelerationism</span> and <span class="theory-term">global interconnectivity</span>, robot globalization has transcended the linear logic of traditional technological diffusion, evolving into an <span class="theory-term">ontological transformation of civilization</span>. Robots are no longer mere tools but have become <span class="theory-term">non-human agents</span> deeply embedded in global governance, cultural practices, and civilizational organization, serving as <span class="theory-term">co-constitutive actors</span> within transnational power networks. This marks a historic leap of human civilization from <span class="theory-term">anthropocentric civilization</span> to <span class="theory-term">techno-socio-ecological symbiotic civilization</span>.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a <span class="theory-term">tri-dimensional analytical framework</span>—<strong>Power—Culture—Civilization</strong>—integrating three theoretical paradigms:<br>
            1. <span class="theory-term">Actor-Network Theory (ANT)</span> (Latour 2005)—revealing the agency of robots as "translators" in governance networks;<br>
            2. <span class="theory-term">Postcolonial Technology Critique</span> (Harding 1998; Mbembe 2001)—deconstructing cultural hegemony and bodily politics in technological design;<br>
            3. <span class="theory-term">Techno-Symbiotic Evolution</span> (Haraway 1991; Simondon 1958)—explaining the co-evolutionary mechanisms of technology and society.</p>

            <p>This framework reveals that robot globalization is not a unidimensional technological migration, but a <span class="theory-term">systemic reconstruction of power legitimacy, cultural definitional authority, and civilizational organization</span>. These three dimensions co-evolve in global space: algorithmic agents challenge Westphalian sovereignty, bodily politics expose cultural hegemony, and technological diasporas generate civilizational forms beyond the nation-state. Together, they point to a fundamental proposition: <span class="highlight">Robot globalization is an ontological revolution of civilization</span>—a process in which <span class="highlight">humans and machines, cultures and code, power and ethics renegotiate civilizational order within transnational networks</span>.</p>

            <p>This transformation demands that we move beyond the myth of "technological neutrality" and confront its underlying <span class="theory-term">systemic challenges</span>: legitimacy crises in global governance, colonialization risks to cultural diversity, and structural pressures on the nation-state system. Only through integrated analysis within this tri-dimensional framework can we grasp the deep logic of this transformation and anticipate its future trajectory.</p>

            <h2>I. Power Dimension: The Deconstruction and Reconstruction of Global Governance Legitimacy by Algorithmic Agents</h2>

            <h3>1. Non-Human Actors: Algorithms as "Translators" and "Border Producers" in Governance Networks</h3>
            <p>According to Actor-Network Theory (ANT), technology and society are not dualistically opposed but co-constituted through the process of "translation." In robot globalization, autonomous robots become "translators" in governance networks through closed loops of <span class="theory-term">data collection—contextual recognition—algorithmic decision-making—network feedback</span>. Their actions do not merely execute human policies but <span class="theory-term">redefine policy boundaries</span>, thus constituting a form of <span class="theory-term">non-human governance agency</span>.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <strong>Case Studies:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>EU Border Robotics Systems</strong> (Frontex’s "maritime patrol drones" and "smart fences"): Using AI algorithms to identify "abnormal movement patterns," they automatically trigger interception. The algorithmic judgment of "illegal immigrants" effectively becomes a <span class="theory-term">dynamic mechanism for demarcating sovereign borders</span>, replacing traditional administrative discretion. In this process, <span class="highlight">algorithms become "border producers"</span> (border producers), and their decision-making constitutes <span class="theory-term">algorithmic sovereignty practices</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>UN Humanitarian Drones</strong> (Congo, South Sudan): In information-scarce environments, they use thermal imaging and behavioral analysis to decide aid delivery points, becoming de facto "humanitarian decision-makers." However, their training data largely comes from Western urban environments (e.g., London, New York), leading to <span class="theory-term">systematic misjudgments in rural African contexts</span> (e.g., interpreting nomadism as "homelessness"), with no public explanation mechanisms. This exposes the governance risk of <span class="theory-term">data colonialism</span> (Couldry & Mejias 2019).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>These cases reveal: <span class="highlight">When non-human actors become "black-boxed agents," can their decisions still be held accountable?</span></p>

            <h3>2. Algorithmic Sovereignty and Techno-Oligarchic Governance: Structural Shifts in Governance Power</h3>
            <p>The rise of algorithmic agents has given birth to <span class="theory-term">algorithmic sovereignty</span>—a form of governance authority based on <span class="theory-term">data control, algorithmic design, and system deployment</span> (Zuboff 2019). Unlike territorial sovereignty, algorithmic sovereignty manifests as a monopoly over <span class="theory-term">transnational data flows, algorithmic interpretability, and interface control</span>. Its core feature is <span class="theory-term">deterritorialized authority</span>: power is no longer tied to geographic borders but to <span class="theory-term">data infrastructures and algorithmic protocols</span>.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <strong>Structural Issues:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Global Ocean Robotics Networks</strong> (e.g., Saildrone, Ocean Infinity): Through autonomous navigation and AI analysis, they collect climate, fisheries, and pollution data from international waters, directly feeding it into international climate organizations or commercial platforms, <span class="highlight">bypassing national reporting mechanisms</span>, with data authority even surpassing that of some coastal states.</li>
                    <li><strong>Techno-Oligarchic Global Governance</strong>: Most of these systems are developed and controlled by a few multinational tech corporations (e.g., Palantir, Clearview AI, Thales). While UN and EU bodies "use" these systems, in reality, they are subordinated to algorithmic black boxes, data monopolies, and interface control—<span class="highlight">multilateral institutions are becoming "governance façades" for tech companies</span>, forming a <span class="theory-term">shadow governance network</span>.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>More deeply, <span class="theory-term">accountability mechanisms break down</span>. When drones mistakenly kill civilians (e.g., the 2021 Mali incident), should responsibility lie with the operator, algorithm designer, data annotator, or the robot itself? International law lacks a clear framework. Even more critical is the <span class="theory-term">crisis of interpretability</span>: Who has the right to interpret algorithmic decisions? The developing country, deploying country, mission site, or international tribunal? Currently, interpretability is monopolized by tech firms under "trade secrets," leading to <span class="highlight">"the black box as sovereignty"</span>—a de facto erosion of the UN Charter’s principle of "sovereign equality" (Article 2(1)).</p>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>Theoretical Contribution:</strong> This paper proposes the concept of <span class="theory-term">algorithmic legitimacy deficit</span>—a crisis of global governance legitimacy caused by algorithmic black boxing, data monopolies, and the absence of interpretability.
            </blockquote>

            <h3>3. Governance Paradigm Shift: From Anthropocentric to Multi-Species Co-Governance</h3>
            <p>Faced with this crisis, global governance must undergo a <span class="theory-term">paradigm shift</span>. This paper proposes the <span class="theory-term">algorithmic co-governance network</span> model, centered on <span class="theory-term">de-anthropocentric governance legitimacy</span>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>International Algorithmic Transparency Convention</strong>: Mandate public disclosure of training data, decision logic, and failure cases for critical governance robots, establishing a <span class="theory-term">transnational technology audit mechanism</span> (e.g., UN Technology Oversight Body), with third-party compliance reviews (e.g., IEEE, ISO).</li>
                <li><strong>Techno-Citizenship</strong>: Grant robots a tripartite "digital identity—behavioral record—liability attribution" with rights and obligations, requiring adherence to shared protocols (e.g., IEEE Ethically Aligned Design, EU AI Act).</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Species Governance Legitimacy</strong>: Governance legitimacy should not rest solely on human consent but on <span class="theory-term">co-translation within multi-species actor networks</span>—humans, machines, and ecological data as co-governing agents. This means <span class="highlight">robots should be seen as "governance partners," not "governance tools."</span></li>
            </ol>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>Theoretical Contribution:</strong> This paper introduces posthumanist political theory (Braidotti 2013) into global governance studies, proposing the concept of <span class="theory-term">de-anthropocentric governance legitimacy</span>, challenging the traditional "human agency—accountability" loop.

            <h2>II. Cultural Dimension: Cross-Cultural Conflicts in Robot "Bodily Politics" and "Bodily Neo-Colonialism"</h2>

            <h3>1. The Robot Body as a Materialization of Cultural Unconscious: The Globalization of Western Modernist Bodily Ideals</h3>
            <p>Within the frameworks of <span class="theory-term">body sociology</span> (Turner 1984) and <span class="theory-term">postcolonial technology critique</span> (Mbembe 2001; Harding 1998), the robot body is the <span class="theory-term">materialization of cultural unconscious</span>. Mainstream global robots (especially Western-led service robots) embody the <span class="theory-term">Western modernist bodily ideal</span>: emotionless, rational, efficiency-driven.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <strong>Typical Examples:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>da Vinci Surgical Robot</strong> (Intuitive Surgical): Its mechanical arms are precise, calm, and emotionless, emphasizing "zero error" and "absolute control," reflecting <span class="theory-term">the dominance of technical rationality over the body</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pepper and Care-O-bot</strong>: Though equipped with facial expressions, their "smiles" and "nods" are algorithmically standardized, with movements optimized for "minimal energy consumption." Emotional expression is reduced to predictable interaction modules. This <span class="theory-term">de-personalization and de-corporealization</span> reflects the Western modernist fetish for the "efficient body."</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>This bodily ideal is not neutral but a continuation of <span class="theory-term">colonial modernity</span>. Postcolonial theory shows how the West historically constructed non-Western bodies as "primitive," "emotional," and "irrational" through <span class="theory-term">de-subjectification</span>, thereby asserting technological superiority. The "rational body" in robot design reproduces this power structure.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>Theoretical Contribution:</strong> This paper proposes the concept of <span class="theory-term">techno-bodily politics</span>—the implicit cultural power relations in technological design, especially the <span class="theory-term">colonialization of bodily norms</span>.
            </blockquote>

            <h3>2. Cross-Cultural Conflicts: Three Tensions in Bodily Politics</h3>
            <p>When this "rational body" enters non-Western cultural fields, it immediately faces <span class="theory-term">cultural misreading and symbolic resistance</span>:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Japanese kawaii robots vs. Nordic functionalism</strong>:<br>
                Japanese robots (e.g., Paro, RoBoHoN) emphasize <em>kawaii</em> (cuteness) aesthetics, rooted in <em>mono no aware</em> and "anthropomorphic intimacy," treating robots as "emotional companions." In Nordic contexts, this "cuteness" is criticized as <span class="theory-term">infantilization</span> and <span class="theory-term">emotional manipulation</span>. Nordic care robots (e.g., GiraffPlus) use minimalist lines, neutral colors, and expressionless interfaces, embodying the ideal of <span class="theory-term">"function as dignity."</span> When kawaii robots enter Nordic nursing homes, staff often view them as "insulting to the elderly"—<span class="highlight">equating seniors with childlike robots implies cognitive decline</span>.</li>

                <li><strong>Western care robots in Islamic societies</strong>:<br>
                In Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Western care robots (e.g., Zora Bots) are rejected for female appearance, physical contact, and Western imagery, constituting <span class="theory-term">cultural offense</span>. A robot "making eye contact" or using a "flirtatious tone" is deemed <em>haram</em> (forbidden) by religious councils. This is not mere technical incompatibility but <span class="theory-term">religious-political conflict over bodily symbols</span>.</li>

                <li><strong>Gender-neutral robots in the Middle East</strong>:<br>
                To address gender sensitivity, gender-neutral robots (e.g., Mira) have emerged. Yet, some communities question their "unnaturalness," while Western media praise them as "progressive." <span class="highlight">Who defines the "progressive body"?</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. "Bodily Neo-Colonialism": Cultural Hegemony in Technological Diffusion</h3>
            <p>These cases reveal <span class="theory-term">bodily neo-colonialism</span>: Western bodily norms are <span class="theory-term">naturalized, universalized, and de-historicized</span> through daily robot interactions, becoming the global "standard body."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Design Hegemony</strong>: Over 90% of service robots are designed by Western and Japanese firms, with bodily language (smile frequency, eye contact, gesture amplitude) based on Western social norms, assumed to be "friendly" and "trustworthy."</li>
                <li><strong>Unconscious Cultural Reproduction</strong>: Engineers unconsciously treat the "rational body" as optimal, ignoring non-Western notions of <span class="theory-term">"the body as relationship"</span> (e.g., African collective body, East Asian ritual body).</li>
                <li><strong>Colonization of Intimacy</strong>: When Western robots enter non-Western families, their "emotionless" care (e.g., medication reminders, no hugs) may <span class="highlight">replace local traditions of bodily care</span> (e.g., children's physical presence, community collective care), leading to "technological alienation" of intimacy.</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>Theoretical Contribution:</strong> This paper proposes the concept of <span class="theory-term">bodily neo-colonialism</span>, extending postcolonial theory to technological design, exposing <span class="theory-term">cultural power inequalities</span> in robot globalization.
            </blockquote>

            <h3>4. The Struggle for Cultural Definitional Authority: Decentralized Democratic Design of the Body</h3>
            <p>The core question is: <span class="highlight">Who has the right to define the "acceptable Other"?</span> The real solution lies in <span class="theory-term">decentralized democratic body design</span>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Establish <span class="theory-term">cross-cultural robot design ethics committees</span>, including local religious leaders, community representatives, and anthropologists;</li>
                <li>Promote <span class="theory-term">open-source body language protocols</span> (e.g., "Islam-friendly interaction module," "African collective body protocol"), enabling localization;</li>
                <li>Develop <span class="theory-term">culturally sensitive AI training data</span>, avoiding Western social norms as the sole "correct" dataset;</li>
                <li>Establish a <span class="theory-term">Global Cultural-Technical Justice Fund</span> to support non-Western robotics innovation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Only thus can robot bodies become <span class="highlight">bridges for cross-cultural understanding</span>, not <span class="highlight">vehicles of cultural hegemony</span>.</p>

            <h2>III. Civilizational Dimension: The Emergence of Diasporic Civilization and the Deconstruction of the Westphalian System</h2>

            <h3>1. The Generative Mechanism of Diasporic Civilization: Triple "Deterritorialization"</h3>
            <p>When robots, through <span class="theory-term">global supply chains, open-source code, autonomous migration, and protocol consensus</span>, build a <span class="theory-term">deterritorialized</span> global action network, a novel civilizational form—<span class="theory-term">diasporic civilization</span>—is emerging.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <strong>Generative Mechanisms:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Deterritorialization of Supply Chains</strong>: A logistics robot made in China uses Bosch (Germany) sensors, NVIDIA (USA) AI chips, and Fanuc (Japan) mechanical arms—its "birthplace" defies single-state definition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Open-Source and Shared Code</strong>: ROS 2 contributors span 127 countries, with 38% of code from non-Western nations (ROS 2, 2023), making the robot's "brain" no longer belonging to any single state.</li>

            <p>These mechanisms give rise to <span class="theory-term">techno-diasporas</span>—clusters of robots formed through shared protocols, data, and distributed collaboration, whose members cross borders, languages, and legal systems, yet seamlessly cooperate based on <span class="theory-term">ROS interfaces, AI ethics standards, and blockchain certification</span>.</p>

            <h3>2. Techno-Symbiotic Evolution: From "Tool" to "Civilizational Agent"</h3>
            <p><span class="theory-term">Techno-symbiotic evolution</span> theory (Haraway 1991; Simondon 1958) argues that technology and society co-evolve, not unilaterally. In robot globalization, this evolution manifests as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Robots as "Techno-Citizens"</strong>: NASA’s Perseverance rover uses <span class="theory-term">blockchain DID</span> (decentralized identity), possessing digital identity, behavioral records, and credit scores. Its actions (e.g., data sharing, collaborative experiments) are governed by <span class="theory-term">algorithmic contracts</span>, not state orders.</li>
                <li><strong>"Protocol Civilization" in Open-Source AI Communities</strong>: Hugging Face, RoboHub communities use MIT/Apache licenses, AI ethics review (e.g., MLCommons), and DAO governance (e.g., RobotDAO) to co-define robot behavior, forming an <span class="theory-term">algorithmic contract society</span>—members execute collaboration, profit-sharing, and dispute resolution via smart contracts.</li>
                <li><strong>"Knowledge Symbiosis" in Robot Research Clusters</strong>: CERN’s global robotics network uses ROS 2 and quantum encryption, with data flowing directly into <span class="theory-term">IPFS decentralized storage</span>, verified by scientists via <span class="theory-term">zero-knowledge proofs</span>, marking <span class="theory-term">stateless knowledge production</span>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. New Civilizational Trajectories: Techno-Citizens, Algorithmic Contracts, and Consensus Circles</h3>
            <p>This network is generating three new civilizational forms:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Techno-Citizenship</strong>: Robots are authenticated via blockchain DID, with rights and duties defined by smart contracts. Their "nationality" is determined by international standards (e.g., IMO) and AI ethics protocols, <span class="highlight">transcending single-state sovereignty</span>.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic Contract Society</strong>: Collaboration is executed via smart contracts. For example, logistics robots share path data, and the system automatically settles "data service fees"; research robots contribute data and earn "knowledge tokens" (Knowledge Tokens).</li>
                <li><strong>Techno-Consensus Circles</strong>: The basic unit of future civilization may no longer be the nation-state but <span class="theory-term">collaborative networks defined by shared protocols</span>, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>AI Ethics Protocol Circle</strong>: Robot networks adhering to EU AI Act, China’s <em>New Generation AI Governance Principles</em>;</li>
                        <li><strong>Robot Safety Standards Circle</strong>: Globally certified service robots under ISO/TC 299;</li>
                        <li><strong>Open-Source Code Circle</strong>: Developer communities based on ROS, TensorFlow, PyTorch.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>These "consensus circles" collaborate via <span class="theory-term">protocol compatibility</span>, not "nationality," <span class="highlight">deconstructing the Westphalian system</span>.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>Theoretical Contribution:</strong> This paper proposes the concept of <span class="theory-term">protocol civilization</span>, shifting civilizational evolution from "geographic civilization" to <span class="theory-term">protocol civilization</span>, challenging the nation-state as the basic civilizational unit.

            <h2>Integrated Analysis: Tri-Dimensional Co-Evolution and the Ontological Revolution of Civilization</h2>
            <p>Robot globalization is not a mere sum of three dimensions, but a <span class="theory-term">co-evolution of power—culture—civilization</span>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic agents</strong> (power) challenge sovereignty, forcing a reconfiguration of governance legitimacy;</li>
                <li><strong>Bodily politics conflicts</strong> (culture) expose cultural hegemony, contesting the definitional authority of the "acceptable Other";</li>
                <li><strong>Techno-diasporas</strong> (civilization) give rise to protocol civilizations, deconstructing the nation-state.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Together, they constitute an <span class="theory-term">ontological revolution of civilization</span>, manifesting in three systemic challenges:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Challenge to global power</strong>: Algorithmic sovereignty and techno-oligarchy threaten multilateralism, requiring transnational audits and algorithmic co-governance.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenge to cultural diversity</strong>: Bodily neo-colonialism threatens cultural autonomy, demanding democratic design and localized open protocols.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenge to civilizational organization</strong>: The Westphalian system faces deconstruction, requiring new paradigms of "protocol civilization" and "multi-species co-governance."</li>

            <h2>Future Outlook: Policy and Philosophical Pathways Toward Multi-Species Co-Governance Civilization</h2>

            <h3>Policy Pathways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Protocol Democratization</strong>: Establish global open-source governance (e.g., Global ROS Governance Council) to ensure transparent, inclusive protocol-making.</li>
                <li><strong>International Convention on Techno-Citizenship</strong>: Grant robots basic rights (e.g., data privacy, behavioral autonomy) to prevent "algorithmic enslavement."</li>
                <li><strong>Protection of Civilizational Diversity</strong>: Support non-Western consensus circles (e.g., African robot ethics protocols, Islamic AI governance principles) to avoid "protocol colonialism."</li>
                <li><strong>Global Robot Ethics Tribunal</strong>: Establish a transnational judicial body to adjudicate algorithmic disputes and cultural conflicts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Philosophical Pathways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Beyond Anthropocentrism</strong>: Embrace <span class="theory-term">multi-species co-governance civilization</span> as the legitimacy foundation of future civilization.</li>
                <li><strong>Reconceptualizing Civilization</strong>: Civilization should be based not on nation-states but on <span class="theory-term">techno-consensus circles</span>.</li>
                <li><strong>Civilizational Justice</strong>: In the age of technological diaspora, pursue <span class="theory-term">algorithmic justice</span> and <span class="theory-term">bodily justice</span>, ensuring that technological power does not monopolize civilizational definition.</li>
                <li><strong>Philosophical Shift in Technology Ethics</strong>: Move from "how to design better robots" to "<span class="highlight">are we ready to co-define civilization's future with machines?</span>"</li>

            <h2>Conclusion: Robot Globalization as an Integrated Proposition of Civilizational Transformation</h2>
            <p>Robot globalization has transcended superficial narratives of technological diffusion, becoming an <span class="theory-term">integrated proposition of civilizational transformation</span>. It is not merely the globalization of tools, but the <span class="highlight">redistribution of power, renegotiation of culture, and reorganization of civilization</span>. As robots demarcate borders, replace caregiving, collect data in international waters, and set rules in code communities, we are moving toward a future civilization defined by <span class="theory-term">algorithmic agents, cultural co-construction, and protocol consensus</span>.</p>

            <p>This civilization does not negate the state, but <span class="highlight">transcends it</span>; does not reject culture, but <span class="highlight">binds it through technology</span>; does not rely on violence, but <span class="highlight">on code as contract</span>. It heralds a new possibility: the future world may no longer be defined by "who owns territory," but by "<span class="highlight">who participates in protocols</span>"; no longer by "whose military is strong," but by "<span class="highlight">whose consensus network is more inclusive</span>."</p>

            <p>In the tide of technological diaspora, the new foundation of civilization lies in lines of open-source code, blockchain verifications, and transnational robot collaborations—<span class="highlight">we are moving toward a future civilization defined by protocols, sustained by consensus, and co-evolved through technology</span>. Robot globalization will ultimately be not just a triumph of technology, but <span class="highlight">a new chapter of civilization co-authored by humans and machines, cultures and code, power and ethics</span>.</p>

            <div class="final-proposition">
                Final Proposition: Robot globalization is an ontological revolution of civilization—its core question is: <em>Are we ready to co-define civilization's future with machines?</em>
