The "shù jiǎ" (term) you mentioned could have several meanings. Please specify which aspect you need help with:

1. **Mathematics-related**  
   - If it's a shorthand for a math subject (such as junior high or high school math), I can help with problem-solving or explaining concepts.
   - If it refers to university-level courses like "Mathematical Analysis" or "Advanced Mathematics," I can also assist with exercises or concept explanations.

2. **Specific Term or Course**  
   - In certain regions or curricula, "shù jiǎ" might refer to a specific math course (e.g., Math Group A). Please provide additional context.

3. **Possible Typo**  
   - If it's a typo (e.g., you meant “sequence,” “function,” “geometry,” etc.), please clarify your question.

Please provide more information or specific problems, and I’ll do my best to assist you!
