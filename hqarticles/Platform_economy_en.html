                The platform economy has transcended its role as a mere technological tool to become a central force reshaping the structure of modern society. Its profound impacts are not only seen in improved resource allocation efficiency but more fundamentally in the paradigm shift of <b>time order, cognitive labor, and data ownership</b>. This article proposes a triple-logic framework: "reconstruction of time — cognitive alienation — data commons," revealing how the platform economy systematically reconstructs the interaction between individuals and society. Building on this, it constructs a new governance paradigm centered on the concept of "platforms as digital public infrastructure," ultimately proposing <b>constitutional principles for platform governance</b> to lay the institutional foundation for fundamental rights in the digital society.

                <h2><span class="section-number">I</span>Reconstruction of Time: From Linear Time to Algorithmic Time</h2>
                <p>
                    Traditional societies rely on linear, predictable temporal structures, whereas the platform economy achieves "<b>commodification and flexibility of time</b>" through algorithmic scheduling. Platforms prioritize "instantaneity" as their core value, fragmenting user time into measurable, schedulable "micro-units," forming what we call <b>algorithmic time</b>—a new temporal order driven by algorithms and measured by response speed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Food delivery riders navigate under system countdowns, short-video users are trapped by "infinite scroll" mechanisms, and ride-hailing drivers chase "optimal routes" during surge pricing. These are not individual efficiency choices, but manifestations of a time-discipline mechanism constructed by platforms through <b>dynamic pricing, behavioral nudging, and feedback loops</b>. Time is no longer a medium for lived experience but has become an "input variable" optimized by platforms for efficiency. This reconstruction essentially represents an <b>imbalance in time justice</b>: individual time is systematically expropriated without corresponding compensation or autonomy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Theoretically, this echoes Hartmut Rosa's critique of "social acceleration," but goes further: platforms do not merely accelerate social rhythms; they structurally deprive individuals of time through algorithms—time no longer belongs to individuals but has become a configurable production factor under platform control.

                <h2><span class="section-number">II</span>Cognitive Alienation: From Autonomous Thinking to Algorithmic Inducement</h2>
                <p>
                    The reconstruction of time further triggers <b>cognitive alienation</b>. Platforms incorporate users' cognitive processes into algorithmic feedback loops through personalized recommendations, attention economies, and behavioral design. Users no longer make choices based on rational judgment but are guided by "<b>cognitive scaffolding</b>"—their attention, preferences, and even emotions are modeled and shaped in reverse by platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "immersive interfaces" of short-video platforms, the "emotional polarization algorithms" of social media, and the "guess what you like" systems of e-commerce platforms are not neutral technologies, but cognitive manipulation systems grounded in <b>behavioral psychology and predictive modeling</b>. Users fall into "<b>cognitive outsourcing</b>"—ceding their judgment to algorithms, leading to cognitive degradation and weakened autonomy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This process can be reinterpreted within Marx's framework of "alienated labor": in the platform economy, <b>cognitive labor</b> becomes a new form of exploitation. While using platforms, users continuously generate data, attention, and emotional investment—forms of "digital labor"—which are captured by platforms without compensation and converted into capital accumulation. More crucially, users are not only exploited but also <b>deskilled</b>: their judgment, critical thinking, and time management abilities gradually weaken in algorithmic environments, forming "<b>cognitive dependency</b>"—platforms are no longer merely tools, but have become alternative subjects of cognition.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    Case studies show that adolescents who rely heavily on recommendation algorithms exhibit significantly lower performance in information discernment, logical reasoning, and delayed gratification compared to control groups (OECD, 2023), confirming the structural consequences of cognitive alienation.

                <h2><span class="section-number">III</span>Data Commons: From Private Property to Public Trust</h2>
                <p>
                    The combined outcome of time reconstruction and cognitive alienation is the <b>exponential generation and concentration of data</b>. Users' time investment and cognitive behaviors are transformed into behavioral data, aggregated in platform databases, forming "<b>data commons</b>"—a new resource characterized by non-excludability, non-rivalry, and high positive externalities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, current data governance still follows a "<b>data privatization</b>" paradigm, treating user data as platform assets. This violates the collective nature of data generation (contributed by users, platforms, and society) and leads to a "<b>tragedy of the commons</b>": platforms, driven by profit maximization, abuse data, causing privacy violations, algorithmic discrimination, and systemic risks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This article argues that platform data governance should shift toward a "<b>data public trust</b>" framework. This theory originates from the "public trust doctrine" in environmental law, which holds that natural resources should be managed by the government as a trustee for the public good. By analogy, <b>platform data should be treated as public infrastructure in the digital age</b>, managed under fiduciary duties: platforms, as trustees, must serve data producers (users) and the public interest, not merely shareholder interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data commons does not negate platforms' technical contributions, but emphasizes their <b>structural position</b>: platforms are no longer ordinary enterprises, but <b>critical nodes</b> supporting social interaction, information flow, and economic activity. Their data assets possess quasi-public goods characteristics, requiring governance logic that transcends market logic and embraces public responsibility.

                <h2><span class="section-number">IV</span>Institutional Response: Platforms as Digital Public Infrastructure</h2>
                <p>
                    In the face of these systemic challenges, traditional regulatory paradigms (e.g., antitrust, consumer protection) have proven inadequate. Platforms must be redefined as <b>new forms of public infrastructure</b>, and governance frameworks must be reconstructed accordingly.
                </p>
                <h3>1. Platforms as the Social Contract of the Digital Age</h3>
                <p>
                    The platform economy embodies a <b>digital social contract</b>: users cede parts of their time, data, and cognitive autonomy in exchange for service convenience; platforms bear corresponding public responsibilities. This contract must be institutionalized through mechanisms such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Sovereignty Return</strong>: Users have rights to access, portability, and deletion of their data;</li>
                    <li><strong>Algorithmic Transparency Obligation</strong>: Platforms must disclose core recommendation mechanisms and accept independent audits;</li>
                    <li><strong>Open Public Interfaces</strong>: Ensuring fair access for third-party developers and researchers to data and APIs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Public Reconfiguration of Platform Governance</h3>
                <p>
                    Platforms should be integrated into a <b>public governance system</b> through the establishment of a "<b>Platform Oversight Committee</b>" composed of government, technical experts, user representatives, and ethicists, responsible for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Establishing platform conduct codes;</li>
                    <li>Monitoring algorithmic fairness;</li>
                    <li>Assessing social impacts (e.g., effects of attention economies on adolescent mental health).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) has taken a key step by designating "gatekeeper platforms" as "critical digital services" and mandating interoperability. But further, a <b>Platform Public Trust Fund</b> should be established, allocating a portion of platform profits (e.g., from data rents) to support digital literacy education, algorithmic auditing, and public data infrastructure, achieving "<b>social redistribution of data dividends</b>."
                </p>

                <h3>3. Institutionalizing Time Justice and Cognitive Labor Rights</h3>
                <p>
                    Institutional responses must transcend the "efficiency-first" logic by incorporating <b>time justice</b> and <b>cognitive labor rights</b> into the category of fundamental rights:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Time Justice</strong>: Protecting individual autonomy over time, limiting algorithmic overuse (e.g., establishing a "digital right to disconnect");</li>
                    <li><strong>Cognitive Labor Rights</strong>: Recognizing users' labor contribution in data generation, granting rights to data profit sharing, algorithmic explanation, and cognitive autonomy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2><span class="section-number">V</span>Forward-Looking Conclusion: Constitutional Principles for Platform Governance</h2>
                <p>
                    Governance of the platform economy must not stop at technical fixes, but rise to the construction of a <b>digital constitution</b> (digital constitutionalism). This article proposes three <b>constitutional principles for platform governance</b> as a framework for fundamental rights in the digital society:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Principle of Time Justice</strong><br>
                        Individuals have the right to autonomous control over their time. Platforms must not systematically deprive individuals of temporal freedom through algorithmic mechanisms. States must guarantee a "right to digital rest" and a "right to algorithmic pause" to prevent temporal colonization.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Principle of Cognitive Labor Rights</strong><br>
                        Users’ attention, behavioral data generation, and emotional labor on platforms constitute a new form of labor, entitling them to data profit sharing, algorithmic transparency, and cognitive recovery rights. Platforms must establish "cognitive compensation mechanisms," such as data dividends and attention insurance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Principle of Data Public Trust</strong><br>
                        Platform data, as digital public goods, must be managed by platforms in a fiduciary capacity, serving user rights and the public interest. States should establish data trust institutions to supervise platforms’ fulfillment of fiduciary duties and prevent data monopolization and abuse.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    These three principles form the "iron triangle" of rights in the digital society: <b>time is the foundation of life, cognition is the condition of freedom, and data is the medium of power</b>. Only by elevating them to constitutional rights can we resist platform capital’s erosion of individual dignity and public interest.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Conclusion: Toward Institutional Awareness in the Digital Society</h2>
                <p>
                    The triple reconstruction of the platform economy reveals the deep tension between technological power and social structure. Governance cannot be limited to "regulating platforms," but must <b>reconstruct the social contract</b> by integrating platforms into the public governance system and establishing their legal status as digital public infrastructure. Only then can we achieve a paradigm shift from "platform capitalism" to "platform publicism."
                </p>
                <p class="conclusion">
                    The legitimacy of future digital societies will not be determined by algorithmic efficiency, but by whether they uphold the fundamental values of <b>time justice, cognitive autonomy, and data sharing</b>. The constitutional principles of platform governance represent a institutional commitment to these values—not merely a solution to technical problems, but the foundational bedrock of human dignity in the digital age.
