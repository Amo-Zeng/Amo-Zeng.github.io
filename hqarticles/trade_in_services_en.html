            <h3>I. The Metaverse and Virtual-Reality Integration: New Dimensions and Challenges in Service Trade</h3>
            <p>The metaverse, once a concept confined to science fiction, is rapidly transitioning from imagination into reality. With its powerful sense of immersion, interactivity, and creativity, it is opening up new frontiers for service trade.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Breaking Temporal and Spatial Limits, Achieving Global Service Trade:</strong> Services in the metaverse are no longer constrained by geographical location. Users can interact with service providers from around the world at any time and place to access the services they need.</li>
                <li><strong>Redefining Service Experiences, Enhancing Service Value:</strong> Technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality bring a qualitative leap to service experiences. Users can immerse themselves in services, gaining more personalized and precise experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Generating New Services, Expanding Service Boundaries:</strong> The metaverse provides fertile ground for new services such as digital art, virtual real estate, and virtual social interactions, continuously expanding the boundaries of service trade.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, the construction of the metaverse and virtual-reality integration also faces numerous challenges:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Governance Challenges:</strong> Virtual-reality integration will bring new social governance issues, such as the legal status of virtual assets and moral norms in the virtual world, requiring joint participation from all parties to build a multi-stakeholder governance system.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>II. Technological Empowerment and the Digital Divide: Inclusive Development in Service Trade</h3>
            <p>Digital technology has brought unprecedented opportunities to service trade:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Efficiency Improvement:</strong> Automated processes, intelligent analysis, and predictive technologies significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of service delivery, reducing operational costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Innovation:</strong> Emerging service models such as telemedicine, online education, and cross-border e-commerce are thriving, breaking time and space limitations and creating new value.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Expansion:</strong> Digital platforms connect supply and demand, enabling small and medium-sized enterprises to participate more easily in the global market, expanding the range of service trade participants.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, technological empowerment is not uniformly beneficial, and the negative effects of the digital divide on service trade are becoming increasingly apparent:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure Gap:</strong> Significant differences exist between developed and developing countries, and between urban and rural areas, in internet penetration, speed, and digital infrastructure, constraining the release of technological dividends on a broader scale.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Skills Divide:</strong> The learning and application of digital technology require corresponding skill sets, and those lacking digital literacy find it difficult to adapt to the digital trade environment, exacerbating social inequality.</li>
                <li><strong>Inequality in Data Access and Usage:</strong> Data resources are unevenly distributed, with a few countries and enterprises controlling large amounts of data, giving them a competitive advantage, while data-scarce countries and enterprises are at a disadvantage in data-driven service trade.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Facing the dual challenges of technological empowerment and the digital divide, promoting inclusive development in service trade is crucial:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strengthening Infrastructure Development:</strong> Increasing investment in digital infrastructure to bridge the digital divide between regions and populations, creating conditions for more people to participate in service trade.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Digital Skills Training:</strong> Strengthening digital skills education and training to help workers master digital technologies and improve their employability and entrepreneurial capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting Data Sharing and Standardization:</strong> Formulating fair and reasonable data usage rules to facilitate cross-border data flow and sharing, allowing more people to benefit from data dividends.</li>
                <li><strong>Improving Policies and Regulations:</strong> Establishing and strengthening regulations related to digital trade to ensure data security and privacy and maintain fair market competition.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening International Cooperation:</strong> Developed countries should strengthen cooperation with developing countries, sharing experiences in digital technology development and helping them enhance their competitiveness in service trade.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Impact on Traditional Employment Models:</strong> The rise of the gig economy has impacted traditional full-time employment models, bringing profound changes to the structure of the labor market and employment relations.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Labor Rights Protection:</strong> Workers in the gig economy often lack stable employment security, social security, and career development opportunities, facing issues such as unstable income, high labor intensity, and limited career advancement.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Divide and Data Security Threats:</strong> The gig economy heavily relies on digital technologies, but the digital divide between different regions and populations exacerbates social inequality. Additionally, data security and privacy protection issues remain urgent.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Facing both opportunities and challenges, building a balance between flexible employment and social security is key to promoting the healthy development of the gig economy and reshaping the new landscape of service trade:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improving Legal Regulations, Defining Platform-Worker Relationships:</strong> It is essential to accelerate the formulation and improvement of legal regulations related to the gig economy, clearly defining the legal relationships between platforms and workers, and standardizing platform responsibilities to protect the rights and interests of workers.</li>
                <li><strong>Innovating Social Security Systems, Building a Multi-Layer Protection System:</strong> In response to the characteristics of the gig economy, flexible employment social security systems should be explored, incorporating gig economy workers into the social security system and providing them with diversified social security options.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening Platform Governance, Promoting the Standardized Development of Platform Economy:</strong> Platform enterprises should strengthen self-discipline, assume social responsibilities, establish and improve platform rules, protect workers' rights, and maintain fair market competition.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Workers' Skills, Promoting Career Development:</strong> Governments and society should strengthen vocational skills training for gig economy workers, improving their professional skills and employability and creating more career development opportunities.</li>
                <li><strong>Reducing the Digital Divide, Ensuring Data Security:</strong> Investment in digital infrastructure should be increased to enhance digital literacy among all populations and bridge the digital divide. Additionally, data security and privacy protection should be strengthened to create a safe and trustworthy digital environment for the gig economy.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
