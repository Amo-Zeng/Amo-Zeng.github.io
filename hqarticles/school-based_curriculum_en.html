            <h2>Multidimensional Innovation in School-Based Curriculum</h2>
            <p>As a vital component of school education, the school-based curriculum carries the mission of personalized education and the responsibility of promoting educational equity and cultivating students' core competencies. This article will explore how to construct a more vibrant, equitable, and educationally valuable school-based curriculum system through innovative design, from the dimensions of student-led curriculum design, the practical exploration of educational equity, and the integration of core competencies.</p>

            <h3>I. Student-Led: A New Model of School-Based Curriculum from Needs to Symbiosis</h3>
            <p>Traditional school-based curriculum design models are teacher-led, with students being more passive participants, lacking deep involvement in the content and form of the curriculum. To transform students from passive participants to active creators, school-based curriculum design should adopt an "iterative curriculum development" model, starting with student needs and ensuring dynamic adjustments to promote co-growth with students.</p>

            <h3>II. Educational Equity: Pathways for Resource Sharing and Regional Collaboration</h3>
            <p>The implementation of school-based curricula varies significantly across different schools, especially in terms of resource distribution imbalance between urban and rural areas, regions, and schools. To promote educational equity, the implementation of school-based curricula should focus on resource sharing and collaboration, optimizing resource allocation and narrowing the educational gap between urban and rural areas and regions through the "shared school-based curriculum" model and regional linkage.</p>

            <h3>III. Core Competencies: Innovation and Practice in School-Based Curriculum Design</h3>
            <p>With the evolution of educational concepts, the school-based curriculum is no longer merely a supplementary course to meet students' interests and needs, but should become an important vehicle for cultivating students' core competencies. By integrating interdisciplinary content and core competency indicators, the school-based curriculum can effectively enhance students' comprehensive competencies, cultivating their thinking abilities, problem-solving skills, and collaboration and communication skills.</p>

            <h3>IV. Synergistic Progress: The Integration of School-Based Curriculum and National Curriculum Standards</h3>
            <p>The design of school-based curricula should not only focus on students' interests and needs but also maintain a synergistic relationship with national curriculum standards, achieving an organic combination of flexibility and normativity. Through this synergy, school-based curricula can enrich students' learning experiences and help them better grasp the knowledge and abilities outlined in national curriculum standards.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The design and implementation of school-based curricula should be driven from the dimensions of student-led, educational equity, and core competencies, constructing a more vibrant, equitable, and educationally valuable curriculum system. In the future, as school-based curricula continue to deepen and develop, their role in promoting educational equity and comprehensive student development will become more pronounced, providing significant support for building a more balanced and high-quality educational system.</p>
