            <h2>Profound Transformation in the Film Industry</h2>
            <p>Under the dual impact of digitalization and globalization, the film industry is undergoing a profound transformation. Film policies, traditionally aimed at promoting cultural output and ensuring cultural security, now must find a new balance in the rise of streaming, the rapid development of digital technology, and the strong demands of public art education. This is not just a simple adjustment of policy frameworks, but a silent revolution involving culture, technology, and values. This revolution is quietly changing the ecosystem of the film industry and redefining the ways of cultural dissemination and the essence of social interaction.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Output and Cultural Security in the Context of Globalization</h3>
            <p>The deepening of globalization has made the balance between cultural output and cultural security in film policies increasingly complex. Hollywood, with its mature commercial operation model, has successfully permeated American values into every corner of the globe, becoming a model of cultural output. Meanwhile, South Korea, through government support and industrial upgrading, has created the "Korean Wave" cultural phenomenon, serving as another successful example. In contrast, China's "going global" path has been more曲折. Despite facing challenges such as cultural discounts and market adaptability, Chinese films have gradually explored an effective path to tell Chinese stories in a universal language through works like "The Wandering Earth." However, globalization is also accompanied by an increasing crisis of cultural identity. The younger generation is more susceptible to the impact of foreign cultures, and the weakening of local cultural identity has become an important issue that policymakers cannot ignore. How to maintain cultural diversity while strengthening the sense of local cultural identity has become a难题 that film policies must face.</p>

            <h3>The Rise of Streaming and Challenges to Copyright Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>The rise of streaming has completely overthrown the production, distribution, and consumption models of films. Platforms like Netflix and Disney+ have built a content distribution empire centered on algorithm recommendations, leveraging their powerful capital and technological advantages. This centralized distribution model has greatly improved the efficiency of content dissemination but has also weakened the voice of creators, making traditional copyright protection mechanisms increasingly ineffective in the digital age. Creators struggle to survive in the gap between algorithms and platforms, facing a predicament where their creative motivation is dissolved. How to rebuild a fair copyright ecosystem under the impact of new technologies has become a core issue that film policies need to urgently address. In this context, decentralized copyright protection systems, such as those based on blockchain technology, may provide creators with a more transparent and fair creative environment.</p>

            <h3>Two-Way Empowerment of Film Policy and Public Art Education</h3>
            <p>In this context, the two-way empowerment of film policy and public art education is particularly important. As a form of public art with strong appeal, films are not only a vehicle for entertainment but also a crucial medium for cultural dissemination, value transmission, and art education. By encouraging diversified subject creation, film policy provides rich content resources for public art education. For example, works like "Dying to Survive" and "The Wandering Earth" not only entertain audiences but also stimulate public thinking about social issues and human values through profound themes and unique narratives. The construction of art cinema circuits and the development of film education projects further reshape the model of public art education, enabling audiences to shift from passive acceptance to active participation and from single aesthetics to multiple dialogues.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Building a New Cultural Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>Furthermore, the interaction between film policy and public art education is building a new cultural ecosystem. In this ecosystem, films are no longer mere entertainment products but become a bridge connecting art and life, theory and practice. Through policy-guided diversified creation, films provide content support for public art education; through the construction of circuits and the development of education projects, films expand the boundaries of art education; through unique artistic expressions, films achieve the transmission of values and the construction of social influence. This interactive relationship not only enhances the public's artistic literacy but also quietly promotes the progress of social civilization.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Challenges and Future Prospects</h3>
            <p>However, this silent revolution also faces numerous challenges. How to carve out new survival space for creators under the heavy pressure of streaming platforms? How to rebuild a fair copyright ecosystem under the impact of digital technology? How to protect local culture while achieving global cultural output? These questions not only test the wisdom of film policies but also concern the fundamental value of the cultural and creative industry. In the future, the formulation of film policies needs to seek dynamic balance between openness and protection, maintaining the necessary openness while establishing appropriate protection mechanisms. At the same time, policies should encourage diversified content distribution channels, avoiding platform monopolies and providing more opportunities for small and medium-sized production companies and independent creators. Additionally, decentralized copyright protection systems based on blockchain technology can achieve full traceability of content ownership, transactions, and rights protection, creating a truly fair and open creative environment for creators.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In this silent revolution, the deep integration of film policy and public art education enriches the cultural life of society and shapes a new cultural identity and value system. This revolution, depicted with light and shadow, paints a more beautiful cultural landscape, not only changing the way people perceive the world but also quietly promoting the progress of social civilization. As a unique form of public art, films are quietly changing the cultural landscape of the world with their powerful appeal and dissemination power.</p>
