            <h3>Growth Background and Psychological State</h3>
            <p>Budel's growth background has had a profound impact on his psychological state. Psychological research indicates that childhood experiences largely shape a person's character and behavioral patterns. Budel may have experienced some traumatic events or lacked love and care during his growth, leading to certain defensive behaviors in adulthood.</p>
            <p>For example, Budel may have experienced neglect or abuse from his parents during his childhood, which could lead to fear and distrust of intimate relationships in adulthood. According to attachment theory, such insecure attachment relationships can cause him to exhibit avoidant or conflicting behaviors in interactions with others.</p>

            <h3>Interpersonal Relationships and Social Network</h3>
            <p>Budel's interpersonal relationships are also important clues to understanding his psychological state. He often exhibits coldness and detachment in interactions with others, which may be a way to protect himself from harm. Psychologist Alfred Adler's individual psychology suggests that everyone seeks superiority and self-perfection, and Budel's behavior may be a way to compensate for his inner feelings of inferiority.</p>
            <p>Budel's social network can be divided into multiple layers, with the core layer consisting of his family, close friends, and closest business partners. These individuals not only play important roles in his personal life but also provide strong support for his career development. Data analysis reveals that Budel interacts most frequently and deeply with his core layer.</p>
            <p>Beyond the core layer, Budel has a broader extended layer, including colleagues, partners, industry experts, and socialites. These individuals typically interact with Budel in work or social activities but with lower frequency and depth. The existence of the extended layer enables Budel to quickly acquire industry information and resources, enhancing his influence in social settings.</p>
            <p>The outermost peripheral layer includes Budel's fans, ordinary friends, and occasional acquaintances. Although these individuals interact with Budel infrequently, their presence adds diversity and breadth to his social network, making him more attractive in various social settings.</p>
