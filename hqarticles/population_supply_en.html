            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The issue of population supply has long been a core topic in national development strategies. Traditional "quantity control" strategies have played important roles during specific historical periods, but as globalization and technological progress accelerate, the limitations of this strategy are becoming increasingly apparent. Meanwhile, the drawbacks of the resource occupation model are also becoming more pronounced, with issues such as unequal resource distribution and low utilization efficiency seriously hindering social sustainable development. Facing these challenges, we must re-examine the issue of population supply, shift from "resource occupation" to "resource sharing," and from "quantity control" to "quality improvement," to build a more fair, efficient, and sustainable new population supply model.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>I. The Dilemma of Resource Occupation and Quantity Control</h2>
            <h3>1. Limitations of Resource Occupation</h3>
            <p>The traditional population supply model is built on the foundation of resource occupation. Population growth means more demand for natural resources such as land, water, and energy, as well as greater pressure on social resources like education, medical care, and housing. In this model, there is an inherent contradiction between population and resources:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limited total resources, making it difficult to meet the growing population's needs.</strong> The Earth's resources are finite, and the trend of population growth is difficult to reverse in the short term, leading to increasingly突出的resource supply and demand矛盾, which引发了一系列社会问题，如环境污染、资源枯竭、社会不平等加剧等。</li>
                <li><strong>Unequal resource distribution, exacerbating social矛盾.</strong> Under the resource occupation model, resource distribution often follows market规律, leading to the concentration of resources in the hands of a少数人, expanding the wealth gap and intensifying social矛盾.</li>
                <li><strong>Low resource utilization efficiency, making sustainable development difficult.</strong> In the resource occupation model, people's utilization efficiency of resources is often low, with significant waste, making it difficult to achieve sustainable resource use.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Limitations of Quantity Control</h3>
            <p>Since the 1970s, China has implemented a strict family planning policy aimed at controlling population数量, alleviating resource pressure and environmental burden. This policy effectively controlled population growth in the short term and provided favorable conditions for economic development and social stability. However, over time, the single "quantity control" strategy has exposed many issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Issues such as人口老龄化, labor shortages, and gender比例失衡 are becoming increasingly突出, posing new challenges to social and economic development.</strong> Relying solely on population数量 control is no longer sufficient to meet future development needs.</li>
                <li><strong>The population dividend is gradually disappearing, and the traditional model of driving economic growth through廉价 labor is becoming unsustainable.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Structural contradictions in labor supply are突出, with insufficient supply of high-skilled人才, and the coexistence of "difficulty in hiring" and "difficulty in finding employment," constraining high-quality economic development.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>II. Resource Sharing and Quality Improvement: A New Population Supply Model</h2>
            <h3>1. Resource Sharing: A New Approach to Reconstructing Population Supply Models</h3>
            <p>Facing the困境 of traditional population supply models, "resource sharing" offers us a全新的道路. Resource sharing refers to optimizing resource allocation and utilization through technological means and institutional design, allowing more people to share the fruits of social development.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technological empowerment, breaking resource spatial and temporal limits.</strong> The rapid development of the internet, internet of things, artificial intelligence, and other technologies provides technical support for resource sharing. For example, shared mobility platforms can optimize traffic resource allocation and reduce traffic congestion; shared office spaces can improve office space utilization and reduce corporate costs; shared medical resource platforms can enable cross-region sharing of medical resources, alleviating the issue of uneven medical resource distribution.</li>
                <li><strong>Institutional innovation, promoting fair resource distribution.</strong> Governments can regulate resource distribution through tax, subsidy, and social security systems to缩小贫富差距 and promote social fairness and justice. For example, property taxes can be imposed to curb rapid housing price increases, allowing more people to afford homes; universal healthcare can be implemented to enable more people to access quality medical services.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural leadership, establishing the concept of shared development.</strong> Resource sharing requires the joint efforts of the entire society, the establishment of the concept of shared development, and the promotion of a simple, moderate, green, and low-carbon lifestyle, opposing extravagance, waste, and excessive consumption.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Quality Improvement: The Key Direction of New-Era Population Supply</h3>
            <p>"Quality improvement" not only refers to the enhancement of population quality but also includes multidimensional improvements such as health水平, educational attainment, and innovation能力. High-quality population supply is the key to supporting the country's long-term development.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Education and skill training.</strong> The primary way to improve population quality is through education and skill培训. By普及高质量教育, we can cultivate high-quality人才 and enhance the competitiveness of the labor market. Skill培训 can enable the workforce to better适应 rapidly changing industrial needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological innovation and talent cultivation.</strong> In an era driven by technological innovation, high-quality人才 are the core force driving technological progress and industrial upgrading. The country should increase its efforts to train and引进科研人才, building a globally competitive talent队伍.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthy aging.</strong> As the trend of人口老龄化 intensifies, improving the health水平 and quality of life for the elderly population becomes an important课题. Through medical technological innovation and health management, we can achieve healthy aging and缓解养老压力.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>III. Proactive Shaping: Building a Positive Population Supply System</h2>
            <p>Facing the new challenges of population issues, we must adhere to the development philosophy of "putting people first," integrating the issue of population supply into the overall layout of national development strategies, and adopting a "proactive shaping" approach to build a positive population supply system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Optimizing人口结构, stimulating人口发展活力.</strong> We should accelerate the establishment of a comprehensive生育 support policy system, reduce the costs of生育,养育, and education, increase生育意愿, and promote long-term人口均衡发展. At the same time, we should actively respond to人口老龄化, improve the养老服务 system, build a multi-level社会保障 system, and create a social environment where the elderly can养老, 有所依靠, and enjoy a fulfilling life.</li>
                <li><strong>Improving人口素质, cultivating a high-quality人才队伍.</strong> We should increase investment in education, optimize the allocation of educational resources, improve the vocational education system, and train skilled人才 who meet the needs of economic and social development. At the same time, we should create a social environment that respects人才 and encourages innovation, attracting and retaining high-level人才, providing strong人才 support for economic and social development.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting人口流动, optimizing人口空间布局.</strong> We should remove institutional and structural barriers to人口流动, guide人口 to move reasonably and orderly between urban and rural areas and regions, and promote the coordinated development of人口 and resources and the environment. At the same time, we should strengthen regional coordinated development strategies, guide industries and人口 to concentrate in advantageous regions, forming new driving forces for high-quality development.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>From "resource occupation" to "quality improvement," the solution path for population supply issues is undergoing profound transformation. The combination of resource sharing and quality improvement is not only an effective means of addressing current challenges but also a strategic choice for achieving long-term national development. Through multidimensional and multi-level policy measures, building a high-quality population supply system can lay a solid foundation for the nation's prosperity and stability, creating a better future for humanity.</p>
