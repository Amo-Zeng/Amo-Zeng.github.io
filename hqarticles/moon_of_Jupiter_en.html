            <h2>Jupiter's Moons: The Intersection of Cosmic Mysteries and Human Future</h2>
            <p>In the solar system, Jupiter, with its majestic presence and colorful stripes, attracts the gaze of the world. However, the true allure of this "giant" planet extends far beyond its appearance. The group of moons orbiting it, like pearls in the cosmos, are not only a record of the solar system's origin and evolution but also a crucial step for humanity's journey towards an interstellar civilization.</p>

            <h3>Time Capsule: Unlocking the Secrets of the Early Solar System</h3>
            <p>Jupiter's satellite family, especially the Galilean moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—form a unique "time capsule," recording the evolution of the solar system billions of years ago. The existence of these moons is not just an astronomical wonder but also an invaluable treasure for scientific research.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Volcanoes and the Song of Ice and Fire: Io's Dynamic Sculpture</strong>  
                    Io is one of the most volcanically active bodies in the solar system, covered in sulfur and sulfur dioxide frost, with active volcanoes constantly erupting, resembling a dynamic sculpture gallery.</li>
                <li><strong>The Ocean Beneath the Ice: Europa's Gateway to Life</strong>  
                    Europa is famous for its vast subsurface ocean beneath its icy shell. This mysterious ocean is considered one of the most likely places in the solar system to harbor life.</li>
                <li><strong>The Mystery of Giants: Exploring Ganymede's Core</strong>  
                    Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system, is even larger than Mercury. Its surface is composed of silicate rock and ice, and it may contain a metallic core.</li>
                <li><strong>The Impact Museum: Callisto's Historical Scars</strong>  
                    Callisto is jokingly referred to as the "impact crater museum" due to its densely packed craters, which record the early history of frequent asteroid and comet impacts in the solar system.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Interstellar Bridge: The Future Road from Europa to Earth</h3>
            <p>Among Jupiter's moons, Europa stands out. It is not only an important witness to the early history of the solar system but also an ideal springboard for humanity's journey towards an interstellar civilization. Europa's subsurface ocean provides endless speculation about the existence of life and offers the possibility of transforming it into a habitable planet.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Planetary Engineering: From Fantasy to Reality</strong>  
                    For a long time, planetary engineering has been considered a plot in science fiction. However, with the rapid development of technology, this dream is gradually becoming a reality.</li>
                <li><strong>Europa's Advantage: The Ideal Test Site for Planetary Engineering</strong>  
                    Compared to other planets like Mars, Europa has significant advantages in planetary engineering: relatively stable environment, abundant water resources, and controllable experimental conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Staged Transformation: The Progressive Path from Laboratory to Reality</strong>  
                    The habitable transformation of Europa will be a long and complex project, requiring staged and gradual advancement: initial exploration and research, establishing outposts, building ecosystems, and atmospheric transformation.</li>

            <h3>The Symbol of Exploration: The Journey from Earth to Jupiter</h3>
            <p>Human exploration of Jupiter's moons began in 1610 when Galileo observed the four largest moons of Jupiter using a homemade telescope. This discovery overturned the then-prevailing geocentric theory and paved the way for the establishment of the heliocentric theory. Since then, with the advancement of observational technology, humans have discovered more moons of Jupiter.</p>
