            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Rehabilitation medicine stands at the crossroads of technology and nature. Modern technologies like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics offer unprecedented personalization and efficiency in rehabilitation. At the same time, the healing power of natural environments is increasingly recognized, creating eco-friendly rehabilitation models. This article explores how to integrate these elements to create a comprehensive, multidimensional rehabilitation system that enhances patient recovery in physical, psychological, and environmental dimensions.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Immersive Rehabilitation Experience:</strong> VR technology allows patients to engage in rehabilitation exercises within a safe, controlled virtual environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Data-Driven Personalization:</strong> VR and AR devices can collect real-time data on patient movements, physiological indicators, etc., which can be analyzed by AI to craft highly personalized rehabilitation plans.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Analysis</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AI in Rehabilitation:</strong> AI can provide predictive analysis, identifying potential rehabilitation issues in advance.</li>
                <li><strong>Utilization of Big Data:</strong> By analyzing large datasets from rehabilitation cases, healthcare institutions can discover the most effective rehabilitation strategies.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Psychological Rehabilitation and Group Activities</h3>
            <h4>Impact of Exercise on Mental Health</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Boosting Self-Esteem and Confidence:</strong> Achieving rehabilitation goals gives patients a sense of success and capability.</li>
                <li><strong>Improving Sleep and Reducing Stress:</strong> Regular exercise can regulate sleep patterns and release endorphins.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Social Support in Group Activities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Social Interaction:</strong> Group rehabilitation activities provide social opportunities, reducing feelings of loneliness.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Support:</strong> Within a group, patients can find understanding and encouragement from peers.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Eco-Friendly Rehabilitation</h3>
            <h4>The Healing Effect of Natural Environments</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forest Bathing and Coastal Rehabilitation:</strong> Natural settings like forests and coastlines can lower blood pressure and boost immune function.</li>
                <li><strong>Application of Natural Elements:</strong> Sunlight, air, and water play crucial roles in rehabilitation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Sustainable Rehabilitation Facilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use of Renewable Energy and Green Materials:</strong> Rehabilitation centers employ solar power, wind energy, and eco-friendly materials.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Design:</strong> Building layout, natural ventilation design, and landscaping all consider environmental sustainability.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Integration and Outlook</h3>
            <p>The rehabilitation model that integrates technology with natural environments not only enhances the effectiveness of rehabilitation but also brings positive impacts on psychological and environmental levels.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Education and Awareness:</strong> Through rehabilitation activities and environmental education, raise awareness among patients and the community about conservation.</li>
                <li><strong>Mutually Beneficial Ecosystem:</strong> Rehabilitation centers can participate in or initiate environmental restoration projects.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Challenges and Future</h4>
            <p>Despite the promising prospects of this multidimensional approach to rehabilitation, it faces challenges such as technology costs, data privacy, and acceptance of technology.</p>
