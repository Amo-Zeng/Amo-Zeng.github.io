            <h2>Crops and Modern Agricultural Transformation: Integration of Culture, Technology, and Sustainability</h2>
            <p>With the ever-increasing global population and the mounting challenges of climate change, traditional agricultural models are facing unprecedented pressures. To address these challenges, modern agriculture is undergoing a profound transformation aimed at enhancing the disease resistance, drought tolerance, and yield of crops while ensuring food security and environmental protection. This transformation not only relies on advanced gene editing technologies and sustainable farming techniques but also involves the exploration and utilization of the cultural values and regional characteristics of crops. This article systematically explores the roles of these key factors in the development of modern agriculture, analyzes their dual impacts on the environment and the economy, and looks forward to the future trends and prospects of agriculture.</p>
