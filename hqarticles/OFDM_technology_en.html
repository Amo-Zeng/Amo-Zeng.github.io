            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the era of digital information, the evolution of communication technology has always been a key force driving social development. From the early telegraph systems to today’s high-speed 5G networks, each breakthrough in communication technology has led to technological revolutions, profoundly transforming the way human society operates. Looking ahead, the development of quantum mechanics opens up a new era for communication technology. Quantum communication, as a candidate for next-generation communication technology, is attracting widespread attention from scientists and engineers worldwide due to its nearly unparalleled security and transmission efficiency. Meanwhile, in the field of traditional communication technology, OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) technology, with its efficient spectrum utilization, anti-interference capabilities, and flexibility, has become the cornerstone of modern wireless communication.</p>
            <p>This article will delve into the integration of OFDM technology with quantum communication, bio-signal transmission, and adaptive optimization techniques based on artificial intelligence (AI), revealing its immense potential and broad prospects in the future of communication.

            <h2>OFDM: The Foundation of Modern Communication</h2>
            <p>OFDM is a multi-carrier modulation technology that decomposes high-speed data streams into multiple low-speed sub-data streams and modulates and transmits them on orthogonal sub-carriers. This technique effectively overcomes the interference problems caused by frequency-selective fading and multipath effects, significantly improving spectrum utilization and transmission efficiency. Since its proposal in the 1960s, OFDM technology has undergone multiple iterations and optimizations and is now widely used in modern communication systems, including Wi-Fi, LTE, and 5G networks.</p>
            <p>The core advantage of OFDM technology lies in its orthogonal sub-carrier design, which avoids the inter-carrier interference issues common in traditional frequency division multiplexing technologies. Additionally, by introducing a cyclic prefix, OFDM can effectively suppress inter-symbol interference (ISI) and multipath interference, further enhancing its adaptability in complex channel environments. These characteristics make OFDM an indispensable technology cornerstone in modern communication systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Communication: The Dawn of Next-Generation Communication</h2>
            <p>Quantum communication is a new type of communication method based on the principles of quantum mechanics. Compared to traditional communication technologies, it exhibits significant advantages in security and transmission efficiency. The core technologies of quantum communication include Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Quantum Teleportation.</p>
            <p>Quantum Key Distribution utilizes the non-clonability and quantum superposition principles of quantum states to achieve theoretically absolute secure key transmission. Once a quantum state is observed or measured, its state immediately collapses, making it impossible for eavesdroppers to replicate it. This feature makes QKD a powerful tool for cracking classical encryption methods, providing a new solution for future information security.</p>
            <p>Quantum Teleportation, on the other hand, uses quantum entanglement to achieve lossless information transmission over long distances. Although the technology for quantum teleportation is still in the laboratory stage, its potential is enormous. In the future, it could be used to enable instant communication on a global scale, completely revolutionizing the existing communication paradigm.</p>
            <p>Despite the challenges in implementing quantum communication, such as the stability of quantum bits, the limitations of transmission distances, and the cost of large-scale commercial applications, its prospects are undoubtedly bright. The further development of quantum communication will bring revolutionary changes to the communication technology of human society.</p>
