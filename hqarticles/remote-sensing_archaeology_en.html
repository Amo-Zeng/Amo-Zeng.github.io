            <h2>II. Remote Sensing Imagery and Ancient Land Use and Ecological Evolution</h2>
            <h3>1. Remote Sensing Imagery: The Spatiotemporal Record of Historical Ecology</h3>
            <p>Remote sensing technology, by acquiring and analyzing imagery data from different periods, comprehensively reflects the spatiotemporal changes in land use and ecology.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Image Acquisition and Preprocessing</strong>: Obtaining multiperiod imagery data from remote sensing satellite databases and performing radiometric and geometric corrections to ensure data quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Information Extraction and Classification</strong>: Using methods such as object-oriented classification and supervised classification to extract land use types (e.g., farmland, forest, settlements) from different periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Spatiotemporal Evolution Analysis</strong>: Revealing land use changes and their ecological impacts through spatial overlay analysis and land use transition matrices.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Historical Reflection: Changes in Ancient Land Use and Ecology</h3>
            <p>For example, in China, remote sensing imagery has shown profound changes in ancient land use and ecology:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-Qin Period</strong>: The middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River were dominated by primitive agriculture, with high vegetation coverage and relatively stable ecology.</li>
                <li><strong>Qin and Han Dynasties</strong>: Large-scale land reclamation led to the degradation of forests and grasslands, with early signs of soil erosion.</li>
                <li><strong>Tang and Song Dynasties</strong>: The development of hilly and mountainous regions in the south intensified, further deteriorating the environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Ming and Qing Dynasties</strong>: Excessive land reclamation caused significant desertification issues, severely impacting the environment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Future Outlook: Historical Lessons and Ecological Enlightenment</h3>
            <p>Research based on temporal remote sensing imagery not only provides important data for historical studies but also offers valuable insights for contemporary ecological protection and land management. Reflecting on historical lessons and leveraging traditional ecological wisdom are key paths toward sustainable development.</p>
