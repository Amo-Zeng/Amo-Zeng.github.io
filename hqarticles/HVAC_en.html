            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>With the global increase in energy demand and heightened environmental awareness, HVAC systems in the construction sector are facing unprecedented challenges and opportunities. HVAC systems are not only significant sources of building energy consumption but also key to managing indoor air quality (IAQ) and promoting environmental sustainability. This article explores how to optimize HVAC system performance through artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, and innovative design and management strategies, achieving goals of energy conservation, enhancing indoor health environments, and advancing environmental protection.</p>

            <h3>Smart Control and Environmental Adaptation</h3>
            <h4>1. Smart Adaptation and Prediction:</h4>
            <p>Modern smart HVAC systems utilize AI and sensor technology to monitor and analyze indoor and outdoor environmental conditions in real-time, such as temperature, humidity, and COâ‚‚ levels. Using complex AI algorithms, these systems can automatically adjust operating parameters to optimize energy use. For example, when anticipating weather changes, the system adjusts indoor temperatures in advance to reduce peak energy consumption. Moreover, through machine learning, the system can predict user behavior patterns, pre-adjusting environmental settings to ensure comfort upon the user's entry into the building, thereby reducing unnecessary energy use.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Case Study:</strong> In a certain office building, the smart HVAC system, by predicting employee entry and exit times and weather changes, pre-adjusted temperature and ventilation, saving 20% in energy.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>2. Application of Smart Thermostats:</h4>
            <p>Smart thermostats, like the Nest Learning Thermostat, can learn and adapt to the daily habits of users, providing personalized environmental control. For instance, they automatically switch to energy-saving mode when users are away or adjust to preferred temperatures during weekends. These features not only enhance user experience but also significantly reduce energy consumption.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Feedback from users indicates that smart thermostats not only save energy but also improve comfort and convenience, reducing the need for manual adjustments.</li>
            </ul>
