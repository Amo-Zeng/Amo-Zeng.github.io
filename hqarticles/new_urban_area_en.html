            <h2>New Approaches to Urban New Area Development: From Stock Activation to Smart Empowerment</h2>
            <p>The development of urban new areas has always been a crucial topic in the process of urbanization. Traditional urban new area construction often relies on incremental land expansion, neglecting the effective utilization of existing resources and the deep satisfaction of residents' needs. With the deepening of urbanization, new approaches and strategies are needed for the development of urban new areas. This article will explore new paths for urban new area development from the perspectives of "stock activation," "human-scale," and "digital twin," and propose comprehensive development strategies.</p>

            <h3>I. Stock Activation: From Incremental Expansion to Stock Activation</h3>
            <p>"Stock activation" refers to the reutilization and functional transformation of existing urban resources to revitalize them, rather than relying solely on land acquisition and demolition for spatial expansion. This model emphasizes the deep excavation and value enhancement of existing urban spaces, aiming to achieve optimal resource allocation and sustainable urban development.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resource Optimization and Cost Reduction:</strong> By activating stock, existing urban resources can be effectively revitalized, avoiding repetitive construction and resource waste, thereby reducing development costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Heritage and Community Vitality:</strong> Stock activation helps preserve the historical context and cultural characteristics of the city, enhancing residents' sense of belonging and identity, and boosting community vitality.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Improvement and Ecological Balance:</strong> The stock activation model focuses on green transformation and ecological restoration of existing spaces, contributing to urban environmental improvement and achieving ecological balance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Specific Strategies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Functional Replacement and Spatial Reshaping:</strong> Transform abandoned industrial zones, old commercial areas, etc., into creative industrial parks, cultural and creative blocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Empowerment and Community Building:</strong> Activate the social value of stock spaces through cultural activities and community building.</li>
                <li><strong>Green Transformation and Ecological Restoration:</strong> Conduct green transformation and ecological restoration of stock spaces to enhance their environmental quality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Human-Scale: From Grand Narratives to Micro-Care</h3>
            <p>"Human-scale" refers to centering on human needs and experiences in urban planning and construction, focusing on the micro details of urban spaces and residents' daily lives, and creating livable, business-friendly, and tourism-friendly urban environments. In urban new area planning, emphasizing "human-scale" means shifting from traditional "grand narratives" to "micro-care," paying attention to residents' actual needs and feelings, and enhancing the livability and humanization of the city.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Residents' Happiness:</strong> Improve residents' convenience and quality of life through appropriate street space design and rich public space layout, thereby enhancing their happiness.</li>
                <li><strong>Boosting Community Vitality:</strong> Enhance interaction among residents and community cohesion through the improvement of community functions and organization of community activities, boosting community vitality and sense of belonging.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting Urban Sustainable Development:</strong> "Human-scale" planning focuses on residents' needs and experiences, helping to create livable, business-friendly, and tourism-friendly urban environments, promoting urban sustainable development.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Specific Strategies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appropriate Street Space Design:</strong> In new area planning, focus on the suitability of street space, increase pedestrian paths, bike lanes, and slow-moving systems, creating a pedestrian-friendly urban environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Rich Public Space Layout:</strong> In new area planning, reasonably layout parks, squares, green spaces, etc., providing residents with places for leisure and entertainment.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Function Improvement and Community Building:</strong> In new area planning, focus on the improvement of community functions and organization of community activities, enhancing community vitality and residents' sense of belonging.</li>
            </ul>
