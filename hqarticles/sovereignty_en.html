            <h2>The Reconfiguration of Sovereignty in the Digital Age: The Awakening of Power from Data, Algorithms to the Environment</h2>
            <p>Humanity is undergoing an unprecedented reconfiguration of power, happening at the intersection of digital technology, the global backlash against globalization, and the global environmental crisis. The rapid development of the digital revolution has made data, algorithms, and platforms new sources of power, leaving traditional national sovereignty concepts struggling to cope with these emerging forces. At the same time, the rise of the anti-globalization tide forces countries to balance national interests with global governance, while the global environmental crisis compels the transcendence of traditional national sovereignty concepts and the construction of new environmental sovereignty ideas. The intertwining of these three forces not only challenges the traditional paradigm of sovereignty but also provides new dimensions for redefining and balancing sovereignty.</p>

            <h3>The Rise of Digital Sovereignty</h3>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technology has made data, algorithms, and platforms new sources of power, making traditional national sovereignty concepts increasingly inadequate. Data is hailed as "the new oil," and issues regarding its generation, storage, usage, and ownership rights have sparked wide debate. The control and profit rights of individuals over their own data should be valued and protected, while the role of the state in data governance is also not to be overlooked. Building a balanced data governance framework among individuals, businesses, and the state has become the core challenge of digital sovereignty.</p>

            <h3>Sovereignty Game under the Tide of De-globalization</h3>
            <p>In the process of globalization, countries have deepened their interdependence in economic, technological, and cultural fields. However, globalization has also brought about domestic industrial hollowing out, job opportunities loss, and other issues. To protect their economies, countries have adopted protectionist measures such as raising tariffs and restricting foreign investment. While protectionism may safeguard national sovereignty in the short term, it also weakens the overall efficiency of the global economy, leading to a "beggar-thy-neighbor" situation.</p>

            <h3>The Construction of Environmental Sovereignty</h3>
            <p>Global environmental issues, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental pollution, have transcended traditional national sovereignty boundaries. The impacts of climate change are global, and no country can escape its effects. Rising sea levels threaten the existence of coastal nations, and frequent extreme weather events pose severe threats to global agriculture, infrastructure, and human health. The loss of biodiversity not only affects the stability of ecosystems but also threatens human food security and medical resources. Environmental pollution, especially cross-border pollution like air pollution and marine plastic waste, has exceeded the control of individual countries.</p>

            <h3>Multidimensional Balance of Sovereignty Reconfiguration</h3>
            <p>The rise of digital sovereignty, sovereignty game under the tide of de-globalization, and the construction of environmental sovereignty together form the three dimensions of sovereignty reconfiguration in the new era. The intertwining and interaction of these dimensions require us to find new balance points in digital technology, international relations, and global environmental governance.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The reconfiguration of sovereignty in the new era is not only a challenge to traditional sovereignty concepts but also an extension and development of them. The digital sovereignty, sovereignty game under the tide of de-globalization, and the construction of environmental sovereignty in the global environmental crisis together form the three dimensions of sovereignty reconfiguration. The intertwining and interaction of these dimensions require us to find new balance points in digital technology, international relations, and global environmental governance, achieving the coordination of interests among individuals, businesses, and the state, and promoting the stability and sustainable development of the global order.</p>
