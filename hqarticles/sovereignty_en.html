            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The traditional notion of sovereignty views the state as an inherent and indivisible entity of power, which has dominated modern international relations. However, from a postmodernist perspective, sovereignty can be seen as a "meta-narrative," a widely accepted grand narrative used to explain the world order. The sovereign state system is not naturally existent but constructed by power elites to maintain their interests in a specific historical period and cultural context. With the development of globalization and the information age, the concept of sovereignty is undergoing a transformation.
