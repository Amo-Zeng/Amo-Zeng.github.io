            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Sovereignty, as a core concept in political science, has long been regarded as the cornerstone of national independence. However, in todayâ€™s world marked by globalization, digitization, and increasing ecological diversity, the connotation and extension of sovereignty are undergoing profound reconstruction. From the evolutionary mechanisms in the biological realm to the platform dynamics in the virtual and digital worlds, and to the relinquishment and sharing of sovereignty in global governance, the manifestations and operational logic of sovereignty are exhibiting an unprecedented trend of diversification. This article aims to explore the plurality reconstruction of sovereignty from the perspectives of biological evolution, the virtual and digital worlds, and global governance, analyze its manifestations and challenges in different fields, and propose a new paradigm of sovereignty that is more inclusive and adaptable.</p>

            <h2>I. Sovereignty in Biological Evolution: Resource Control and Social Cooperation</h2>
            <p>In the biological realm, sovereignty can be understood as an exclusive control over resources, as well as a core mechanism for maintaining social structures and group cooperation. Territorial awareness and resource competition are not only driving forces in biological evolution but also the foundation for gene transmission and group cooperation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Territorial Awareness and Resource Control</strong>: Territorial awareness is the most primitive form of sovereignty in the biological world. It helps individuals or groups reduce competitive pressures and ensure survival and reproduction by controlling specific areas or resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Cooperation and Sovereignty Maintenance</strong>: Sovereignty maintenance often relies on group cooperation in many species. For example, wolf packs collectively hunt and defend their territory to maintain their living environment, while bees collaborate through division of labor to ensure the safety of the hive and the efficient utilization of resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Biological Insights</strong>: The "sovereignty" model in the biological world provides important lessons for human society. The balance of resource control and cooperation is the core of sovereignty systems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>II. Sovereignty Reconstruction in the Virtual and Digital Worlds: From Platform Dynamics to Metaverse Challenges</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of digital technology, sovereignty is taking on new forms in the virtual and digital worlds. Issues related to the ownership and management of virtual resources, particularly the sovereignty of network platforms, digital assets, and data, have become new focal points of contention.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Platform Sovereignty and User Rights</strong>: Network platforms, as the infrastructure of virtual spaces, have sparked widespread debate over sovereignty issues. Platform owners have absolute control over platforms, while users lack actual control over the content and data they create on these platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Assets and Data Sovereignty</strong>: Digital assets (such as virtual currencies and NFTs) and data have become the most valuable resources in the virtual world. However, issues related to the ownership and management of these resources involve technology, law, and ethics.</li>
                <li><strong>New Forms of Sovereignty in the Metaverse</strong>: With the rise of the metaverse, the concept of sovereignty will face new challenges. Issues related to the ownership of digital identities, virtual property, and social relationships will become central in the metaverse.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>III. Sovereignty Relinquishment and Sharing in Global Governance: From Regional Integration to Global Issues</h2>
            <p>Globalization has profoundly transformed the landscape of international relations, significantly increasing interdependence among nations. A single concept of sovereignty is no longer sufficient to address global challenges. The relinquishment and sharing of sovereignty have become important characteristics of global governance, particularly in the practices of regional integration and international governance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sovereignty Sharing in the European Union</strong>: The EU has transferred part of its sovereignty to supranational institutions through a series of treaties and institutional arrangements. This sharing model extends beyond economic areas to include judicial and social policy domains.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Issues and Sovereignty Relinquishment</strong>: Climate change, public health, and cybersecurity are global issues that exceed the governance capabilities of individual countries. These issues require nations to relinquish some sovereignty and collaborate internationally to address them.</li>
                <li><strong>Hierarchical and Functional Sovereignty</strong>: In the context of globalization, sovereignty should no longer be seen as a single, absolute power but rather as a hierarchical and functional concept.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>IV. Plurality Reconstruction of Sovereignty: From Evolution to Globalization</h2>
            <p>From resource control and cooperation in biological evolution, to platform dynamics and metaverse challenges in the virtual and digital worlds, and to sovereignty relinquishment and sharing in global governance, the manifestations and operational logic of sovereignty are showing a trend of diversification.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Adaptability of Sovereignty</strong>: Sovereignty is no longer a static, indivisible power but a dynamic, hierarchical governance tool.</li>
                <li><strong>Sovereignty Sharing and Multilateralism</strong>: Multilateralism has become a core principle of global governance, with sovereignty sharing being a key manifestation of multilateralism.</li>
                <li><strong>Balancing Sovereignty and Global Cooperation</strong>: In the era of globalization, the maintenance of sovereignty requires a balance between independence and cooperation.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The plurality reconstruction of sovereignty is a major challenge facing global society. From biological evolution to the digital world and global governance, the manifestations and operational logic of sovereignty are undergoing profound changes. Facing the multiple challenges of globalization, digitization, and ecological diversity, building a more inclusive, adaptable, and cooperative concept of sovereignty will be a crucial path for global governance and the sustainable development of human society.</p>
