            <h2>Food Safety: The Transition from Traditional Management to Scientific Governance</h2>
            <p>Food safety, a global focus of concern, is undergoing a transformation from traditional management models towards a more scientific and sustainable direction. For a long time, the "zero risk" concept has dominated the field of food safety. However, in the complex food supply chain, completely eliminating risk is almost impossible. Therefore, redefining food safety and advocating for "acceptable risk" has become an inevitable trend in the global food sector. At the same time, the introduction of blockchain technology has brought revolutionary changes to food safety, not only enabling full traceability of food but more importantly, building a trust mechanism among consumers, businesses, and governments. Additionally, food waste, as a global issue, poses multiple threats to food safety. This article will explore how to reconstruct a new order in food safety from three dimensions: "acceptable risk," blockchain technology empowerment, and the holistic governance of food waste.</p>

            <h3>I. From "Zero Risk" to "Acceptable Risk": A New Paradigm in Scientific Management</h3>
            <p>The concept of "zero risk" in food safety is rooted in public concerns about food safety. However, in agricultural production, food processing, and transportation, completely eliminating risk is almost impossible. This "zero risk" mindset not only places tremendous economic pressure on the food industry but also hinders the innovation of food technology and the sustainable development of the food industry to some extent.</p>
            <p><strong>"Acceptable risk" is not a compromise on food safety but a scientific risk assessment and management strategy.</strong> It acknowledges that absolute "zero risk" is difficult to achieve in real life and strives to balance public health protection with the development of the food industry. By scientifically evaluating different food risks and setting "acceptable risk" standards, it can effectively avoid over-regulation on food businesses while maximizing public health protection.</p>
            <p>International experience shows that the "acceptable risk" concept is effective in practice. For example, the European Union (EU) applies the "acceptable risk" concept in the formulation of maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticides. The EU Scientific Committee evaluates factors such as pesticide toxicity, usage, and residue levels to establish scientifically reasonable MRLs. These standards do not pursue "zero residue" but ensure that even long-term intake does not pose a significant threat to human health. This approach not only guarantees food safety but also provides the necessary flexibility for agricultural production and food processing.</p>
            <p>Promoting the "acceptable risk" concept requires global cooperation and consensus. Different countries and regions have varying levels of economic development, dietary habits, and risk tolerance, leading to different understandings and standards of "acceptable risk." Establishing a global unified "acceptable risk" assessment system requires the participation of governments, international organizations, research institutions, industry associations, and others to jointly formulate scientific, transparent, and operable standards and guidelines.</p>

            <h3>II. Blockchain Technology Empowering Food Safety: From "Traceability" to "Trust"</h3>
            <p>As global food safety issues become increasingly prominent, consumers demand higher quality and safety standards for food. Traditional food traceability systems struggle to address complex supply chains and information asymmetry. Blockchain technology, with its immutability, transparency, and distributed nature, offers a new solution to the field of food safety.</p>
            <p><strong>The application of blockchain technology in food traceability not only achieves full traceability of food but more importantly, builds a trust mechanism among consumers, businesses, and governments.</strong> Blockchain is a distributed ledger where all participants can share and verify data, and once recorded, data cannot be altered. This means that every step in the food supply chain can be accurately recorded and traced, from the procurement of raw materials, processing, transportation to final sales. All information can be transparently displayed to consumers.</p>
            <h4>Case Study: Beef Traceability in Australia and Pork Traceability in China</h4>
            <p>Australia is one of the largest beef exporters in the world, facing strict international quality standards. To ensure the quality and safety of beef, the Australian government and businesses have collaborated to establish a beef traceability system using blockchain technology. Every step from the birth to the slaughter of each cow is recorded on the blockchain. Consumers can scan a QR code on the product to obtain detailed data such as the cow's birthplace, feeding process, and slaughter information. This system not only enhances consumer trust in Australian beef but also strengthens its competitiveness in the international market.</p>
            <p>In China, pork is a primary meat on consumers' tables. However, recent food safety issues, such as "lean meat powder" incidents, have raised concerns about pork safety. To address this problem, some Chinese enterprises have begun using blockchain technology for pork traceability. Through blockchain, consumers can track every step from the farm to the supermarket, including feed usage, vaccination, slaughter, and transportation. This system not only enhances consumer trust in pork but also helps businesses improve their brand image and market competitiveness.</p>
            <h4>Blockchain Building a "Trust Mechanism"</h4>
            <p>The application of blockchain technology in food traceability is just the first step in empowering food safety. More importantly, blockchain, through its immutability and transparency, constructs a trust mechanism among consumers, businesses, and governments.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Establishing Consumer Trust</strong>: In traditional food supply chains, consumers often lack access to real information and are in a vulnerable position. Blockchain technology makes every step in the food supply chain transparent, enabling consumers to directly access information about production, processing, and transportation, thereby building trust in the food.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Business Trust</strong>: For food businesses, blockchain technology not only improves their traceability capabilities but also enhances their transparency and credibility in the market. Through blockchain, businesses can demonstrate their commitment to food safety, thereby improving their brand image and market competitiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparent Government Regulation</strong>: Governments play a crucial role in food safety regulation. Traditional regulatory methods rely on sampling and penalties, which are difficult to cover all aspects and details. Blockchain technology makes every step in the food supply chain transparent, allowing governments to monitor in real time.
