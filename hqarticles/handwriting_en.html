            <h3>I. Calligraphy: The Code of Civilization and Witness of History</h3>
            <p>From the enigmatic symbols of oracle bone inscriptions to the dignified elegance of bronze script, from the simple sincerity of bamboo and silk manuscripts to the robust thickness of stone inscriptions, each calligraphic form is a product of a specific historical period, carrying unique cultural information and spiritual ethos of that era. Oracle bone inscriptions, as the code of the Shang Dynasty, not only recorded important activities such as divination and sacrifices but also reflected the political system, economic life, and religious beliefs of the Shang Dynasty. Bronze script became the code of the Zhou Dynasty, showcasing its ritual and music systems and the functioning of social order through its dignified and elegant lines. The bamboo and silk calligraphy of the Qin and Han dynasties was closer to daily life, providing us with rich information about the political systems, social life, and technological culture of that period.</p>
