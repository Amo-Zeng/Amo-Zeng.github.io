            <h2>Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Global Corporate Culture Building: An Innovative Integrated Training Model</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>In a globalized business environment, companies face the challenge of effectively training and managing employees in a multicultural context. Traditional cultural training methods often struggle to meet this need due to their lack of interactivity and immersion, making it difficult to unify corporate culture on a global scale. The emergence of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies offers an innovative approach to address this issue. This article will explore how VR and AR technologies can be integrated with employee personal growth paths and cross-cultural communication to build a more inclusive and innovative global corporate culture.</p>

            <h3>Application of VR and AR Technologies</h3>
            <h4>Definition and Differences</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Virtual Reality (VR)</strong>: Users are completely immersed in a simulated three-dimensional environment through head-mounted displays or multiple projection screens, isolating them from the real world. This technology provides a highly immersive experience, allowing users to freely explore and interact within virtual space.</li>
                <li><strong>Augmented Reality (AR)</strong>: It captures the real environment with a camera and overlays digital information onto it, allowing virtual content to interact with the real world. AR enhances the user's understanding and interaction with the real environment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Application of VR in Cultural Training</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Historical Review and Value Instillation</strong>: VR can create a time tunnel where employees can experience the company's development history and key events, deeply understanding the core values and mission of the enterprise. This experiential learning method can enhance employee's identification with the company's history and culture.</li>
                <li><strong>Work Environment Simulation</strong>: New employees can familiarize themselves with their job positions in a virtual environment, reducing the discomfort upon starting work. VR provides a safe and controlled environment for practical training.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Application of AR in Cultural Training</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-time Information Enhancement</strong>: AR devices can provide instant information like building history or significant events, enhancing employees' awareness of their corporate environment. This real-time feedback helps employees integrate into the workplace faster.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive Training</strong>: Employees can interact with virtual objects, participate in team-building or learn about production processes, enhancing the interactivity of training. AR makes the training process more vivid and intuitive.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Cultural Experience</strong>: AR aids employees in understanding cultural backgrounds and work habits of different countries, fostering cross-cultural understanding and integration. Through AR, employees can experience the unique aspects of different cultures firsthand.</li>
            </ul>
