### **Mathematics A (Advanced Mathematics) Course Overview**

Mathematics A (often referred to as “數甲” in senior high school curriculum in Taiwan) primarily focuses on topics taught from 11th to 12th grade. It covers multiple important units. Below is a summary of the common content and learning highlights for Mathematics A.

### **Main Topics in Mathematics A**

#### **1. Polynomial Functions**
- Arithmetic of polynomials (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and factorization)
- Remainder and factor theorems
- Polynomial equations (techniques for finding roots)
- Graphs and properties of polynomial functions (linear, quadratic, and higher degrees)

#### **2. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions**
- Definition and graphs of exponential functions (e.g., $a^x$)
- Definition and properties of logarithmic functions (e.g., $\log_a x$)
- Change of base formula and applications
- Solving exponential and logarithmic equations
- Real-world applications (e.g., pH values, earthquake magnitude)

#### **3. Limits and Functions**
- Concept of limits of functions (including left-hand and right-hand limits)
- Infinite limits and asymptotes
- Continuity of functions
- Rules for calculating limits (e.g., factoring, rationalization)

#### **4. Differentiation**
- Definition of derivatives and their geometric meaning (slope of tangent lines)
- Differentiation rules (for polynomials, exponential functions, etc.)
- Applications of derivatives:
  - Increasing and decreasing functions, extrema
  - Concavity and points of inflection
  - Graph sketching
  - Optimization problems (e.g., maximum and minimum values)

#### **5. Integration**
- Indefinite integrals and basic formulas (for polynomials, exponential functions)
- Definite integrals and their properties (area interpretation)
- Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
- Applications of integration:
  - Area under curves
  - Volume of solids of revolution
  - Physical quantities (e.g., displacement, total accumulation)

#### **6. Probability and Statistics (in some versions)**
- Review of permutations and combinations
- Basic probability and conditional probability
- Expected value and variance
- Normal distribution and standardization (e.g., Z-scores)

#### **7. Matrices and Linear Systems**
- Matrix operations (addition, multiplication, inverse matrices)
- Row operations for systems of linear equations (Gaussian elimination)
- Geometric interpretation of 2x2 linear systems (solution as intersection of lines)

### **Study and Exam Preparation Suggestions**
- **Build solid calculation skills**: Algebraic manipulation is required throughout the course.
- **Focus on understanding, not memorization**: Especially in calculus, grasp the intuitive meaning of limits and derivatives.
- **Practice graphical analysis**: Understand how graphs of polynomials, exponential, and logarithmic functions behave.
- **Use mathematical tools wisely**: Tools like GeoGebra can help visualize function behavior and aid in comprehension.
