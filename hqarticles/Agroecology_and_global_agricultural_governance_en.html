            <h2>Reconstruction and Transcendence: Ecological Agriculture Leading the Paradigm Shift in Global Agricultural Governance</h2>
            <p>In the complex landscape of global agricultural governance, ecological agriculture is no longer merely an alternative production model but is becoming a profound paradigm shift. This shift not only challenges the dominant position of traditional Western industrialized agriculture but also represents a fundamental reconstruction of the global agricultural governance system. By deeply integrating ecological wisdom with digital technologies and introducing the concept of food sovereignty, ecological agriculture offers a more humane, ecological, and equitable path for the future development of global agriculture.</p>

            <h3>Transcending Industrialization: The Paradigm Revolution of Ecological Agriculture</h3>
            <p>The industrialized agricultural model, reliant on mechanization, chemical fertilizers, and monoculture, has improved short-term production efficiency, but its ecological and social costs are increasingly evident. Soil degradation, ecological imbalance, loss of biodiversity, and the disintegration of rural communities are significant challenges faced by global agriculture. Ecological agriculture, centered on mimicking the principles of natural ecosystems, views agriculture as an organic part of an overall ecosystem rather than just a production tool. This paradigm shift not only redefines the concept of "efficiency" but also elevates sustainability to the core goal of agricultural development. Ecological agriculture focuses not only on increasing production but also on the health of ecosystems, the agency of farmers, and the autonomy of local communities. This idea is gradually breaking the dominant logic of industrialized agriculture, pushing global agricultural governance toward greater diversity, inclusiveness, and sustainability.</p>

            <h3>Digital Empowerment: Digital Transformation of Ecological Agriculture and Global Agricultural Governance</h3>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technology has infused new vitality into ecological agriculture and provided an opportunity for the digital transformation of global agricultural governance. Technologies such as the Internet of Things, drones, blockchain, and big data are revolutionizing agricultural production models and efficiency. For example, IoT sensors can monitor soil and climate conditions in real-time, blockchain technology ensures transparency in agricultural supply chains, and big data analysis provides scientific support for precision agriculture. However, the promotion of digital ecological agriculture is not without challenges. In many developing countries and impoverished areas, weak infrastructure and low digital literacy are major obstacles to the widespread adoption of digital technology. This "digital divide" not only exacerbates global agricultural inequality but also undermines the potential of digital technology to be inclusive. Therefore, global agricultural governance needs to focus more on the development of inclusive policies to ensure that the benefits of digital technology reach small-scale farmers and vulnerable groups worldwide, rather than serving only a few wealthy countries or large agricultural enterprises. By bridging the "digital divide," digital ecological agriculture can play a more extensive and profound role in global agricultural governance.</p>

            <h3>Food Sovereignty: Reconstructing Discourse in the Global Food Chain through Ecological Agriculture</h3>
            <p>Food sovereignty, as an idea advocating for the autonomous control of farmers and consumers over the processes of food production, distribution, and consumption, is gradually reconstructing the discourse of the global food chain through the practice of ecological agriculture. In the current globalized food system, the dominant position of multinational agricultural enterprises and market mechanisms often leads to the marginalization of farmers' interests and the weakening of consumer rights. Ecological agriculture, by emphasizing localized production, community participation, and ecological sustainability, provides a practical foundation for the realization of food sovereignty. Models such as Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) and farmer's markets are prime examples, strengthening direct connections between farmers and consumers and promoting local economic and cultural development. However, the realization of food sovereignty is not just an internal issue for ecological agriculture; it requires broader policy support and social consensus in the global food chain. This includes establishing fairer market mechanisms, implementing stricter food safety standards, and raising consumer awareness. Only through global collective efforts can food sovereignty truly play a role in the globalized food system, promoting a more equitable, transparent, and sustainable framework for food governance.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Multidimensional Integration of Ecological Agriculture and the Future of Global Agricultural Governance</h3>
            <p>The rise of ecological agriculture is not only a challenge to traditional agricultural models but also a profound reconstruction of the global agricultural governance system. By combining ecological wisdom with digital technologies and introducing the concept of food sovereignty, ecological agriculture is driving global agriculture toward greater humanism, ecological sustainability, and fairness. This transformation is not only about changing agricultural production methods but also represents a fundamental transcendence of the global agricultural governance paradigm. In the context of globalization, the promotion of ecological agriculture requires the collective efforts of the international community to ensure that this model truly benefits small-scale farmers and vulnerable groups worldwide, driving sustainable agricultural development and equitable governance of the global food chain. The practice of ecological agriculture is not just an innovation in agricultural production methods but also a rethinking of the relationship between humans and nature, pointing the way toward a new future for global agricultural governance.</p>
