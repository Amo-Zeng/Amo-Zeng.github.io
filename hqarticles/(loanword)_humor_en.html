            <h2>Laughter is one of the most complex expressions of humanity</h2>
            <p>Laughter not only conveys joy but also hides cognitive salvation. Humor, as a unique human phenomenon, is far from simple amusement; it is a sophisticated mechanism for cognitive relief. In the face of the absurdity of the world, life's pressures, and inner confusion, humor acts as a therapeutic balm, helping us temporarily shed the heavy burden of thought and regain a lighter perspective on the world.</p>

            <h3>I. Cognitive Overload: The Modern Human Dilemma</h3>
            <p>In the age of information explosion, our brains are constantly bombarded with massive amounts of information. The breadth and depth of knowledge continue to expand, but so does the burden of cognition. Modern people often feel anxious, lost, and powerless, as if trapped in an endless sea of information, unable to find direction or shore. This cognitive overload plunges us into a mental dilemma: we possess unprecedented knowledge, yet struggle to maintain inner peace and clarity.</p>

            <h3>II. Humor: The "Safety Valve" for Cognitive Overload</h3>
            <p>Humor is an effective tool for coping with this dilemma. When we view things with a humorous perspective, serious, heavy, and anxiety-inducing issues are imbued with new meaning, becoming light, funny, or even absurd. This "dimensional reduction" process helps us temporarily escape the shackles of cognition and gain a psychological release.</p>
