            <h3>Eco-anxiety and Social Capital: Dual Dilemmas of Collaborative Responses to Ecological Crises</h3>
            <p><strong>Eco-anxiety: Psychological Projection of Ecological Crises</strong></p>
            <p>Eco-anxiety is a persistent worry and fear related to environmental changes, rooted in people's perception of ecological crises and sense of helplessness. Issues such as climate change, natural disasters, and environmental pollution, which are becoming increasingly severe, constantly impact people's cognition and shake their confidence in the future. Research shows that eco-anxiety not only affects individual mental health but also leads to social problems such as the prevalence of consumerism, political apathy, and social isolation. These phenomena further weaken social capital, which includes trust, norms, and resources within social networks, and is a crucial force for promoting social progress and solving public problems.</p>
            <p><strong>Social Capital: Vital Resources for Addressing Ecological Crises</strong></p>
            <p>Social capital plays a significant role in addressing ecological crises. It can facilitate information sharing and knowledge dissemination, enhance social cohesion and collective action, and influence public policy and institutional construction. However, there is a vicious cycle between eco-anxiety and social capital: eco-anxiety weakens social capital, while the loss of social capital exacerbates eco-anxiety. Facing this dual dilemma, we need to actively explore solutions and build environmentally friendly social capital: improving environmental literacy, fostering social trust, encouraging community participation, and advocating harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.</p>
            <p><strong>Specific Case Study: Success of Community Environmental Projects</strong></p>
            <p>To better understand the relationship between eco-anxiety and social capital, specific case studies can be introduced. For instance, the "Transition Towns" community project in California, USA, aims to address climate change through community participation and environmental education. The project, by organizing community meetings, environmental workshops, and green markets, successfully enhances residents' environmental literacy, strengthens social trust and cohesion. Similar projects include the UK's "Incredible Edible" movement, which promotes community participation and environmental awareness by growing vegetables and fruits in public spaces.</p>

            <h3>Platform Capitalism and Environmental Inequality</h3>
            <p><strong>Fundamentals of Platform Capitalism</strong></p>
            <p>Platform capitalism relies on digital platforms as the core of market operations, connecting supply and demand to facilitate transactions. Its operating model is mainly based on data collection and analysis, optimizing resource allocation through algorithms to maximize economic benefits. Economically, platform capitalism significantly improves the efficiency of resource allocation, reduces intermediate links in traditional transactions, and lowers transaction costs. However, its environmental impact is more complex, especially regarding the unequal distribution of resource consumption, centralized environmental pollution, and the digital divide and environmental pressure.</p>
            <p><strong>Manifestation of Environmental Inequality</strong></p>
            <p>The rapid expansion of platform economies has led to the intensification of logistics and supply chains, resulting in a series of environmental pollution issues. For example, the rise of e-commerce platforms has made express logistics an indispensable part of daily life, with a large amount of packaging materials and transportation emissions significantly affecting air quality and soil and water quality. Additionally, the digital divide not only affects the distribution of economic opportunities but also the access and utilization of environmental resources. Regions and groups unable to access digital platforms often face more severe environmental pressures.</p>
            <p><strong>Specific Case Study: Environmental Impact of Platform Economy</strong></p>
            <p>To delve deeper into the environmental impact of platform capitalism, specific case studies can be introduced. For example, Amazon's logistics centers and data centers worldwide, while bringing economic benefits, also lead to substantial energy consumption and carbon emissions. Moreover, sharing economy platforms like Uber and Airbnb, although improving resource utilization efficiency, bring new environmental challenges such as urban traffic congestion and housing market inequality.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges and Opportunities of Platform Capitalism for Environmental Policy</strong></p>
            <p>The development of platform capitalism also poses new challenges to traditional environmental policies. First, the rapid changes and high flexibility of platform economies make traditional regulatory measures difficult to keep pace. For example, sharing economy platforms optimize resource allocation through algorithms, but their operating models often fall outside traditional legal frameworks, making regulation challenging. Additionally, platform economies have strong data collection and analysis capabilities, posing challenges to policymakers regarding data security and privacy protection. Despite the many challenges, platform capitalism also provides opportunities for environmental policy innovation. For instance, by utilizing the big data collected by platforms, policymakers can conduct more precise environmental monitoring and prediction, and develop more effective environmental protection measures.</p>

            <h3>Climate Change and Emerging Social Movements: Reshaping Social Action Patterns</h3>
            <p><strong>Climate Change: Core of Social Issues</strong></p>
            <p>Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing the world today, affecting various fields including economy, politics, society, and culture. The fundamental cause of climate change is humanity's reliance on fossil fuels and large-scale resource consumption, which not only leads to environmental degradation but also exacerbates social inequality. For example, extreme weather events and rising sea levels caused by climate change have a significant impact on impoverished and marginalized communities.</p>
            <p><strong>Emerging Social Movements: Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Cultural Innovation</strong></p>
            <p>Facing the complex challenges of climate change, emerging social movements adopt different strategies and methods from traditional movements. These movements emphasize interdisciplinary collaboration and cultural innovation, attempting to address climate crises through diverse means. For example, Extinction Rebellion not only calls for urgent government action on climate change but also emphasizes social justice and economic fairness. This interdisciplinary perspective enables movements to attract more participants from different backgrounds, forming a broader social alliance.</p>
            <p><strong>Specific Case Study: Impact of Emerging Social Movements</strong></p>
            <p>To better understand the impact of emerging social movements, specific case studies can be introduced. For instance, Greta Thunberg, the initiator of the Fridays for Future movement, successfully attracted global attention through her protest activities and speeches, pushing for climate policy changes in many countries and regions. Additionally, Extinction Rebellion organized large-scale gatherings in many cities around the world through peaceful protests and artistic expressions, attracting significant public participation and support.</p>
            <p><strong>Global Action: Cross-border Collaboration</strong></p>
            <p>Climate change is a global issue that cannot be addressed by the efforts of one country or region alone. Emerging social movements emphasize global action and cross-border cooperation, attempting to address climate crises through cross-border collaboration. For example, Extinction Rebellion organized peaceful protest activities in many cities around the world, attracting international attention through global actions.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges and Opportunities Facing Emerging Social Movements</strong></p>
            <p>Despite significant achievements in addressing climate change, emerging social movements still face numerous challenges: policy inertia and resistance, public awareness and persistence, and the complexity of cross-border cooperation. However, they also face many opportunities: technological advancements and innovation, the power of youth, and interactions between policy and society.</p>
