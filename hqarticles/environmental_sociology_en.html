            <h2>Multidimensional Perspectives of Environmental Sociology: An Integrated Discussion on Digitalization, Climate Change, and Environmental Emotions</h2>
            <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
            <p>Environmental sociology, as an interdisciplinary field, is dedicated to exploring the complex interactions between humans and the environment. In today's increasingly severe global environmental issues, environmental sociology not only focuses on the natural environment itself but also delves into how social structures, culture, and technology influence environmental conservation. This article will explore the multidimensional perspectives of environmental sociology from three unique angles—digitalization and environmental justice, climate change and social transformation, environmental emotions and social action—aiming to provide a comprehensive analytical framework to promote more innovative and inclusive environmental protection strategies.</p>

            <h3>Digitalization and Environmental Justice</h3>
            <p><strong>Application of Digital Technology in Environmental Justice</strong></p>
            <p>Digital technology has become a vital tool for environmental protection and monitoring. Through satellite remote sensing, drone surveillance, and IoT devices, real-time collection and analysis of environmental data have been made possible, which is crucial for formulating effective environmental policies. However, the spread of digital technology is not uniform, and the digital divide poses significant challenges for marginalized communities in accessing environmental information and resources.</p>
            <p><strong>Digital Technology and Access to Environmental Information</strong></p>
            <p>While digital technology offers unprecedented convenience for collecting and sharing environmental data, marginalized communities often lack the necessary digital infrastructure and technical support, making it difficult for them to access timely and accurate environmental information. According to World Bank research, approximately 3.6 billion people live in areas lacking basic digital services, placing them in a more vulnerable position when facing environmental crises.</p>
            <p><strong>The Digital Divide and Environmental Justice</strong></p>
            <p>The digital divide not only affects access to environmental information but also directly impacts the formulation and implementation of environmental policies. Many policies rely on digital technology for information dissemination and enforcement, but these policies often serve only the digitally advanced communities. For example, a study in Ghana found that extreme weather warnings issued through mobile apps had an 85% coverage rate in urban areas, while only 40% in rural areas. Therefore, bridging the digital divide becomes a key strategy in promoting environmental justice.</p>
            <p><strong>Strategies to Bridge the Digital Divide</strong></p>
            <p>To achieve environmental justice, governments and environmental organizations should invest in digital infrastructure in marginalized communities, and use big data and AI to deeply understand these communities' environmental needs, formulating more targeted policies. For instance, the Kenyan government's "M-Toto" project uses mobile technology to provide timely medical and environmental health information to pregnant women in remote areas, significantly improving environmental health levels in these regions.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Research in environmental sociology reveals the complexity of environmental issues and social interactions by exploring digitalization and environmental justice, climate change and social transformation, and environmental emotions and social action. Digital technology provides tools to address environmental problems, but fairness must be ensured by bridging the digital divide. The profound impact of climate change necessitates profound changes across various societal domains, while environmental emotions, through education and cultural influence, inspire and guide environmental behaviors. In the future, the development of environmental sociology needs to focus more on emotional factors, building a more emotionally rich, action-oriented environmental society to promote global sustainable development.</p>
