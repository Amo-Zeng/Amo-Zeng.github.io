            <h3>1. Exploring the History and Evolution of Drama Competitions: From Court to Folk, From Elite to Masses</h3>
            <p>Drama competitions are not a modern invention; their history can be traced back to ancient Greek drama festivals, such as the famous Bacchanalia, which included drama competition segments with the winners receiving the highest honors. During the medieval period, religious dramas flourished, and churches also became stages for drama competitions.</p>
            <p>With the development of time, drama competitions gradually moved out of the courts and into the folk, with more diverse forms. At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, with the rise of modern drama, drama competitions began to focus on the ideological and artistic quality of works, giving rise to a number of excellent playwrights and works.</p>
            <p>Entering the 21st century, drama competitions have become more focused on diversity and inclusiveness, encouraging works of different styles and themes to compete, providing a stage for young drama enthusiasts to showcase their talents.</p>

            <h3>2. Analyzing the Judging Criteria and Controversies of Drama Competitions: The Game of Artistic and Fairness</h3>
            <p>The judging criteria for drama competitions are diverse, usually including script quality, performance level, stage design, directorial conception, and other aspects. However, artistic judgment itself is subjective, and different judges may give completely different evaluations, which also leads to controversies about the judging criteria and fairness.</p>
            <p>For example, some judges place more emphasis on the ideological depth and social significance of the work, while others focus more on the artistic innovation and visual impact of the work. In addition, judges with different cultural backgrounds may have different understandings of the same work, which can also lead to controversies over the judging results.</p>
            <p>To improve the fairness and transparency of the judging, some drama competitions have begun to introduce a more diversified panel of judges and formulate more detailed scoring criteria, while also encouraging audience participation in the evaluation, forming a more open and inclusive evaluation system.</p>
