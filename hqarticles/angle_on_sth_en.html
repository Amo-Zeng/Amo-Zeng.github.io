            <h2>Multidimensional Perspectives: Cognitive Revolution and New Paths to Cross-Cultural Reconciliation</h2>
            <p>In an era of information explosion, rapid technological advancement, and increasingly global cultural integration, our cognitive methods are undergoing unprecedented challenges and opportunities. From the echo chambers of daily life to perspective shifts in virtual reality, and from conflicts to reconciliations in cross-cultural exchanges, the diversity and transformation of perspectives have become key tools for understanding the world, ourselves, and society.</p>

            <h3>Cognitive Fog: The Limitations of a Single Perspective</h3>
            <p>In our daily lives, we often fall into a simplistic and dangerous fallacy: believing that what we see is the whole picture of the world.

In this technological revolution, perspective shifting—especially between first-person and third-person perspectives—is not just a visual presentation method but a profound cognitive revolution, deeply affecting users' psychological experiences and emotional states.</p>
