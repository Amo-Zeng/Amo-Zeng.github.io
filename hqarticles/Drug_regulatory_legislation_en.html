            <h2>The Evolution of Drug Regulatory Regulations and Future Prospects: Balancing Innovation and Safety</h2>
            <p>As a crucial tool for safeguarding public health, the evolution of drug regulatory regulations reflects not only technological advancements but also the interplay of social, economic, and cultural factors. From the early simplistic notion of "medicine curing illness" to the modern scientific regulatory system focused on "safety and efficacy," drug regulatory regulations have undergone profound changes globally. This article will trace the century-long evolution of drug regulatory regulations, compare and analyze the regulatory systems in different countries and regions worldwide, explore how drug regulatory regulations shape the future of drug development, and envision future directions.</p>

            <h3>I. The Evolution of Drug Regulatory Regulations</h3>
            <h4>1.1 Germination and Initial Development: From "Medicine Curing Illness" to Government Intervention</h4>
            <p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the pharmaceutical market was relatively free from regulation. Drug advertisements often exaggerated claims of "medicine curing illness," and both doctors and patients generally believed in the efficacy of drugs, overlooking potential risks. This simplistic notion stemmed from the lack of medical knowledge and market regulation. However, with the advancement of the industrial revolution and the expansion of drug production scale, safety issues gradually emerged. In 1906, the United States witnessed the shocking "Poisoned Syrup" incident, prompting the government to intervene in drug regulation and enact the "Pure Food and Drugs Act." This was the first federal law in U.S. history aimed at drug safety, marking the initial formation of drug regulation.</p>
            <h4>1.2 Standardization and Scientification: From Clinical Trials to Approval Systems</h4>
            <p>In the mid to late 20th century, with the advancement of medical science, clinical trials became the primary method for assessing drug safety and efficacy. In 1947, the United States first systematically applied randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the "Tuskegee Syphilis Study," laying the foundation for the standardization of clinical trials. The 1938 "Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act" marked a new stage in drug regulation. The Act required drugs to undergo safety testing before market approval and authorized the establishment of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), responsible for drug approval and oversight. The establishment of the FDA and the improvement of its regulatory framework provided a model for global drug regulation.</p>
            <h4>1.3 Globalization and Digitalization: New Challenges and Opportunities in the 21st Century</h4>
            <p>Entering the 21st century, the rise of globalization and digital technologies has brought new challenges and opportunities for drug regulation. The application of big data technology enables regulators to analyze massive amounts of data and monitor drug safety and efficacy in real-time. For example, the FDA's "Sentinel Initiative" uses electronic health records and insurance data to monitor post-market drug safety. Additionally, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain are reshaping the future of drug regulation. AI can be applied in drug development, clinical trial design, and even automated approval processes, enhancing regulatory efficiency. Blockchain technology ensures transparency and traceability in the drug supply chain, preventing the circulation of counterfeit drugs.</p>

            <h3>II. A Comparative Analysis of Global Drug Regulatory Regulations</h3>
            <h4>2.1 Regulatory Framework: Institutional Setup and Functional Division</h4>
            <p>The setup of drug regulatory systems in different countries is closely related to their political, economic, and cultural backgrounds. The United States centers on the FDA, which has high independence and reports directly to the President. The European Union is led by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), with member states having national regulatory agencies (NRAs), and the EMA coordinates regulatory policies across member states. Japan is overseen by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), under the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, emphasizing international alignment. China is centered on the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), forming a relatively complete regulatory network.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Approval Mechanisms: Processes, Standards, and Timelines</h4>
            <p>The United States, European Union, Japan, and China all emphasize comprehensive assessments of safety, efficacy, and quality in drug approval processes, but there are differences in timelines and process design. The FDA has expedited pathways, such as "Breakthrough Therapy" and "Priority Review," to accelerate the market entry of innovative drugs. The EU adopts a combined centralized and decentralized approval model. Japan and China have relatively longer approval processes but also have special approval procedures to promote the market entry of innovative drugs.</p>
            <h4>2.3 Regulatory Tools: Production, Distribution, and Use</h4>
            <p>Countries universally implement Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Good Supply Practice (GSP) to ensure drug quality and safety. Additionally, pharmacovigilance and drug traceability systems are widely applied to safeguard public drug safety.</p>
            <h4>2.4 International Cooperation: Mechanisms and Practices</h4>
            <p>In the context of globalization...</p>
