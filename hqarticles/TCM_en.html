            <h2>The Global Journey of Traditional Chinese Medicine: From Traditional Wisdom to Modern Life Integration</h2>
            <p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), a life science system imbued with Eastern wisdom, has evolved and accumulated over thousands of years, not only standing out in the medical field but also revitalizing in modern society. Under the wave of globalization, TCM is engaging in a dialogue with the world in an unprecedented manner. From the cultural fusion of the ancient Silk Road to the deep empowerment of modern technology, and the global spread of health culture, TCM's globalization process demonstrates a profound integration between tradition and modernity, East and West.</p>

            <h3>I. The Silk Road and Encounters: The Starting Point of TCM Globalization</h3>
            <p>The globalization of TCM is not a modern phenomenon but can be traced back to the ancient Silk Road. This trade and cultural artery spanning Eurasia witnessed the initial journey of TCM spreading westward. Around the 1st century AD, TCM classics such as the Huangdi Neijing were translated into Greek and Arabic, and therapies like acupuncture and herbal medicine began to penetrate Central and West Asia. During the golden age of Arab civilization, scholars like Avicenna systematically incorporated TCM knowledge into Islamic medical systems in his Canon of Medicine. This cross-cultural exchange not only enriched local medical practices but also laid the foundation for the global dissemination of TCM.</p>

            <h3>II. Empowerment by Modern Technology: The Two-Way Reshaping of TCM and AI</h3>
            <p>Entering the 21st century, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has brought unprecedented opportunities and challenges to TCM. TCM diagnostics emphasize the comprehensive analysis of "observation, listening, questioning, and palpation," relying heavily on the physician's personal experience and intuition. However, the limitations of experience, subjectivity in diagnosis, and the scarcity of skilled TCM practitioners have一直是制约 TCM development bottlenecks. The introduction of AI technology provides new solutions to these issues.</p>

            <p>In the context of globalization, TCM's health philosophy has gradually expanded from traditional medical practice into modern lifestyle. TCM's "health culture" is not just a medical practice but a way of life.

From the cultural fusion of the ancient Silk Road to the deep empowerment of modern technology and the global spread of health culture, TCM is widely accepted not only as a medical practice but also as a philosophy of life influencing modern lifestyles. In the future, with technological advancements and the global awareness of health, TCM's health philosophy will further integrate into modern life, becoming an important component of global health culture.
