        <h2>Memory, Discipline, and Contract: Electronic Health Records as the Core Apparatus of Biopolitics in the Digital Age</h2>
        <p class="note">In the flood of data, EHR is not merely a technical tool, but a complex social field where power, memory, discipline, and contract intersect</p>
    </header>

        <section>
            <p>In the data deluge of the 21st century, Electronic Health Records (EHR) have long transcended the simplistic notion of "digitized medical records," quietly evolving into a <span class="highlight"><strong>core apparatus of biopolitics</strong></span>—not just a technological backbone for healthcare systems, but a complex social field interwoven with power, memory, discipline, and contract. From Foucault’s "disciplinary society" to Hardt and Negri’s "data commons of the multitude," from Derrida’s philosophical warning about "archive fever" to contemporary individuals’ struggles for sovereignty in the flood of health data, EHR has become the most profound <span class="highlight"><strong>interface of life governance</strong></span> of our time. This article takes "EHR as a biopolitical apparatus" as its central thread, integrating three key dimensions—"infrastructure of health memory," "preventive discipline," and "digital body contract"—to reveal its inner logic: <strong>memory is the foundation of discipline, discipline depends on contract, and contract reshapes memory</strong>—a cyclical, nested dynamic system of power reproduction. Only through the intersection of "data sovereignty" and "biopolitics" can we penetrate the surface of technology and confront the ethical abyss and possibilities of reconstruction beneath.</p>

            <h2>I. Memory: EHR as the "Infrastructure of Health Memory" and the Contemporary Embodiment of Archive Fever</h2>
            <p>Derrida once warned: "The archive is power." In the EHR system, this proposition has been taken to its extreme. EHR is not merely the electronic storage of medical records, but a <span class="highlight"><strong>systematized collective memory apparatus</strong></span> that transforms individual lives into searchable, analyzable, and predictable "health memories" through data coding, structured input, and algorithmic archiving. This memory is not neutral, but highly selective—it records diabetes risk scores, HIV infection history, and psychiatric diagnoses, yet ignores patients’ emotional fluctuations, social support networks, or cultural backgrounds. As discussed in the first part, EHR systems reconstruct society’s narrative of health through a dual mechanism of <strong>data visibility</strong> and <strong>data silence</strong>: Who is remembered? Who is forgotten? Who is marked as "high-risk"?</p>
            <p>Take <strong>HIV records</strong> as an example. Despite long-term viral suppression in medicine, a positive marker in an EHR may follow a patient for life, becoming a "data stigma" in employment, insurance, and social life. This "digital tattoo" exemplifies Derrida’s "archive fever"—the system’s obsession with memory turns it into a permanent inscription of power. More dangerously, EHR memory is not static. When AI companies use such data to train models, they are further <strong>decontextualized</strong> and <strong>recontextualized</strong>, transformed into predictive health risk scores (e.g., diabetes prediction models), thereby incorporating individual lives into intervention trajectories in advance.</p>
            <p>This memory mechanism is essentially a <span class="highlight"><strong>systemic memory hegemony</strong></span>: constructed jointly by the state, healthcare institutions, and tech companies, it serves the logic of "health efficiency" and "risk management," yet neglects the "right to social forgetting"—the right of individuals to be redefined as "normal" under certain conditions. When EHR becomes the sole legitimate carrier of health narratives, society’s understanding of illness shifts from "pluralistic experiences" to "data-driven destiny."</p>

            <h2>II. Discipline: EHR-Driven "Preventive Discipline" and the Algorithmization of Biopolitics</h2>
            <p>Foucault, in <em>Discipline and Punish</em>, observed that modern power no longer relies on overt violence, but on a <strong>panoptic</strong> mechanism that internalizes norms through self-surveillance. EHR is the 21st-century upgrade of this mechanism: instead of prison walls, it uses <span class="highlight"><strong>algorithmic scores, health alerts, and automatic warnings</strong></span> to internalize preventive interventions into daily life.</p>
            <p>The concept of <strong>preventive discipline</strong> revealed in the second part becomes evident here: when an EHR system generates a "high-risk for diabetes" score for a 45-year-old man and automatically pushes dietary advice, exercise plans, and regular blood glucose tests, the individual enters a <span class="highlight"><strong>closed loop of self-discipline</strong></span>. He is no longer passively treated, but actively managing a "future possible health state." This intervention may seem "caring," but it is in fact a <span class="highlight"><strong>algorithmization of biopolitics</strong></span>—the state, via EHR, individualizes public health responsibility, treating "pre-illness" as a governable object.</p>
            <p>More deeply, this discipline possesses <span class="highlight"><strong>spatial and temporal extension</strong></span>. Take <strong>Apple HealthKit</strong>: it continuously collects heart rate, step count, and sleep quality via wearable devices, syncing data to EHR for "full-time health monitoring." The individual’s body no longer belongs to them, but becomes a continuous data stream. During the pandemic, governments repurposed EHR data to trace contacts and assess vaccine responses, further integrating "health" into <span class="highlight"><strong>state emergency governance</strong></span>. While such "data requisition" may be justified in public health crises, it blurs the boundary between medical data and national security, shifting discipline from "disease prevention" to "population control."</p>
            <p>The legitimacy of discipline rests on the aforementioned "health memory": without continuous EHR records, algorithms cannot generate risk scores; without risk scores, preventive interventions cannot proceed. <strong>Memory is the raw material of discipline; discipline is the reproduction of memory</strong>. When AI models predict an individual’s cardiovascular risk over the next decade based on historical data, they are not merely "predicting"—they are "shaping": silently guiding diet, exercise, and medical behaviors toward the system’s predefined "optimal health path."</p>

            <h2>III. Contract: EHR as the "Digital Body Contract" and the Tripartite Bargain for Data Sovereignty</h2>
            <p>Yet individuals are not entirely passive. The operation of EHR depends on an implicit <strong>digital body contract</strong>—individuals "consent" to provide data in exchange for healthcare, but this contract is deeply asymmetric in practice. As noted in the third part, data flows within EHR systems are, in reality, a <span class="highlight"><strong>tripartite bargain among the state, healthcare institutions, and tech companies</strong></span>: the state requisitions data in the name of public health; hospitals share data for efficiency; tech firms commercialize data under the banner of "innovation," while patients often "consent" through lengthy, opaque terms.</p>
            <p>The fragility of this contract is exposed in cases where <strong>AI companies access EHR data</strong>. When an AI firm acquires millions of anonymized records from hospitals to train disease prediction models under the guise of "new drug development," patients neither know where their data goes nor can they withdraw consent. Worse, these models are sold back to insurers or employers, forming "health credit scores" that deepen social inequality.</p>
            <p>But resistance is emerging. The rise of <strong>data cooperatives</strong> represents an attempt to reconfigure the "digital body contract." For example, Iceland’s "Genetic Data Cooperative" allows citizens to collectively manage their genetic and health data, deciding on usage and benefit distribution; the U.S.-based "Patient-Led Research Collaborative" uses patient-driven platforms to advance rare disease research. These practices shift data sovereignty from "individual surrender" to "collective negotiation," transforming the contract from "unilateral authorization" to "democratic governance."</p>
            <p>Notably, the contract itself reshapes memory. When patients, via data cooperatives, decide which data to share or when to delete, they are in fact <span class="highlight"><strong>redefining what is "rememberable"</strong></span>. A teenager once labeled "high-risk for depression" who chooses to delete that record exercises the "right to digital forgetting," resisting the violence of archive fever. <strong>Contract is not merely the surrender of power, but the rewriting of memory</strong>.</p>

            <h2>IV. The Cycle: The Triadic Dialectic of Memory—Discipline—Contract and the Reproduction of Biopolitics</h2>
            <p>Thus, we uncover the <span class="highlight"><strong>triadic dialectical structure</strong></span> of EHR as a biopolitical apparatus:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Memory</strong> (EHR as health memory infrastructure) provides the data foundation, making "risk" identifiable;</li>
                <li><strong>Discipline</strong> (EHR-driven preventive discipline) is based on memory, intervening in individual behavior through algorithms;</li>
                <li><strong>Contract</strong> (EHR as digital body contract) provides legitimacy to memory and discipline, but its inequity spawns resistance and reconstruction.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These three are not linear causes, but <span class="highlight"><strong>mutually constitutive and dynamically cyclical</strong></span>: memory enables discipline, discipline depends on contract for legitimacy, and changes in contract reshape the boundaries of memory. This cycle is the very mechanism of contemporary biopolitics—no longer solely aimed at "preserving life," but at "optimizing life" through datafication, algorithmization, and contractualization, bringing life itself into the realm of governance.</p>
            <p>From this perspective, EHR is no longer a technical tool, but a <span class="highlight"><strong>materialized crystallization of power relations</strong></span>. It is an extension of state governance, a channel for capital accumulation, and a battlefield for individual resistance.</p>

            <h2>V. Prospect: Toward a "Reflexive EHR"—A New Paradigm of Data Justice, Algorithmic Transparency, and Collective Governance</h2>
            <p>Faced with this complex landscape, we must move beyond the illusion of "technological neutrality" and build a new paradigm of <span class="highlight"><strong>Reflexive EHR</strong></span>. Its core principles include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Justice</strong>: Recognize that data is the digitization of lived experience. Guarantee individuals' <strong>data sovereignty</strong>, including rights to access, correct, and delete data. EHR systems should include "forgetting mechanisms" allowing the erasure of sensitive records (e.g., HIV history, psychiatric diagnoses) under specific conditions, countering the violence of archive fever.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic Transparency</strong>: All predictive models based on EHR (e.g., diabetes risk scores) must disclose training data, variable weights, and uncertainty, subject to independent audits. Patients should have the right to challenge algorithmic scores and request human review.</li>
                <li><strong>Collective Governance</strong>: Establish <strong>multi-stakeholder data governance committees</strong> with patient representatives, ethicists, legal scholars, and technologists to co-create EHR usage rules. Promote data cooperatives, directing data benefits toward public health rather than private capital.</li>
                <li><strong>Contextual Design</strong>: EHR systems should incorporate <strong>social determinants of health</strong> (e.g., income, education, housing) in data collection and assessment, avoiding the reduction of health to individual behavior. AI models should include "bias-detection" mechanisms to prevent systemic misjudgments against minorities (e.g., racial groups, LGBTQ+).</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Democratization</strong>: Develop open-source, auditable EHR platforms, allowing communities to customize features, breaking data monopolies of tech giants and large healthcare systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This "reflexive EHR" is not utopian, but a <span class="highlight"><strong>critical reconstruction</strong></span> of the existing system. It does not reject technology, but demands that technology <span class="highlight"><strong>self-reflect</strong></span>—in every data entry, every algorithmic call, every contract signing: Who benefits? Who bears the risk? Who is remembered? Who is forgotten?</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section-divider"></section>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion: Reclaiming Sovereignty Over Life in the Data Deluge</h2>
            <p>At the heart of EHR lies a struggle over <span class="highlight"><strong>how life is defined, governed, and remembered</strong></span>. It reminds us: in the digital age, health is not merely a medical issue, but a political one; data is not merely information, but power; memory is not merely the past, but the script of the future.</p>
            <p>We stand at a crossroads: one path leads to a "health utopia" under technological determinism; the other, to "life commodification" under data colonialism. The third path is <span class="highlight"><strong>grounded in data sovereignty and measured by human dignity</strong></span>—rebuilding an EHR truly belonging to the people: not a cage of discipline, but a tool of liberation; not a tomb of archives, but a garden of memory.</p>
            <p><strong>Only thus can we reclaim sovereignty over life in the flood of algorithms.</strong></p>
