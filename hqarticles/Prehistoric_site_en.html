                <p>In the grand narrative of human civilization, prehistoric sites are often seen as symbols of the "primitive"—simple stone tools, rough caves, uncivilized settlements. But if we set aside modern-centric biases and reexamine these silent remains, we discover they are actually humanity's <strong>philosophy of technology laboratories</strong>. Here, prehistoric humans systematically explored three core propositions through material practice: <strong>How is cognition externalized? How is society organized? How does civilization endure?</strong> From the stone tools of Olduvai Gorge to the circular structures of Göbekli Tepe, from the patterns on Yangshao pottery to the multifunctional design of Maglemosian bone and antler tools, these seemingly primitive remains record humanity's deep experiments with technology, space, and redundancy. They not only laid the foundation for civilization but also reveal three "philosophy of technology primal forces" that run through human evolution: <strong>externalized cognition, spatial encoding, and redundancy resilience</strong>.</p>

                <h3>I. Cognitive Experiment: How Toolmaking Reshapes Thought Patterns</h3>
                <p>In Tanzania's Olduvai Gorge, 2.6-million-year-old pebble tools lie quietly in the rock layers. These stone tools were once seen as proof of survival skills, but the perspective of archaeological cognitivism reveals their deeper significance: <strong>toolmaking is the materialized experiment of humanity's cognitive revolution</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>The evolutionary trajectory of stone tools—from the simple choppers of the Oldowan culture to the symmetrical hand axes of the Acheulean culture—maps a leap in cognitive paradigms. The bilateral symmetry of Acheulean hand axes far exceeds practical needs; their manufacture requires the artisan to mentally rehearse multi-step operational sequences and maintain a mental representation of the target form—this is the hallmark of <strong>anticipatory thinking</strong>. Embodied cognition theory further points out that this thinking does not occur solely within the brain but emerges through the interaction of the body and the environment: the touch of the hand, the observation of the eye, and the feedback from the stone form a perception-action cycle, allowing cognition to be "offloaded" into the external world. Tools become extensions of thought, and thought is solidified and iterated through tools.</p>
                
                <p>The technological differences between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens highlight a divergence in this experiment. The former showed high environmental adaptation in making Mousterian tools, but the tool types remained stable; the latter, however, burst forth with innovation in the Upper Paleolithic, such as composite tools and decorative elements. This contrast suggests that Homo sapiens completed the transition from "embodied cognition" to "extended cognition" through technological practice—tools became not only practical carriers but also media for symbolic expression and social identity. At these sites, toolmaking and cognitive development formed a self-reinforcing cycle: technology reshapes thought, thought催生 more complex technology, ultimately constructing a continuously evolving "cognitive ecosystem."</p>
                
                <p>This experiment has profound implications for modern artificial intelligence (AI). Current AI research is shifting from "disembodied cognition" to "embodied AI," emphasizing that intelligent agents must learn through interaction with the physical environment. The process of prehistoric humans knapping stone tools is akin to an AI understanding causality through object manipulation in the real world. The lack of <strong>physically grounded cognition</strong> is precisely the root cause of early AI's lack of common sense and adaptability. The history of toolmaking reminds us: intelligence cannot be separated from the dialogue between body and world; AI development needs to rebuild the ancient alliance of "technology-cognition."</p>

                <h3>II. Organization Experiment: How Spatial Layout Encodes Social Rules</h3>
                <p>At Göbekli Tepe in southeastern Turkey, T-shaped pillars are precisely arranged in circular structures, their geometric order far exceeding explanations based solely on ritual function. Analyses from spatial archaeology and network science reveal: <strong>the spatial structure of prehistoric sites is a pre-literal "algorithmic management system"</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>The distribution of paintings in France's Lascaux Cave exhibits spatial symbolic logic: sacred images densely populate the deep parts of the cave, while traces of human activity are more common near the entrance, using spatial depth to metaphorically demarcate the boundaries between the "profane" and the "sacred." Göbekli Tepe takes this further: its multiple stone circles were not built randomly but expanded gradually over centuries. Each circle's T-shaped pillars may represent different clans or totems, with the animal symbols carved on them constituting a "distributed database" that physically encodes social identities, ritual roles, and cooperative relationships into the space. The width, orientation, and connectivity of the pathways between circles regulate the flow of people and the frequency of interaction—this is the core of Space Syntax theory: <strong>spatial structure determines social behavioral patterns</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>The early settlements of Mesopotamia (e.g., Jarmo) provide another case of spatial organization. These settlements show functional zoning: residential units cluster around central courtyards, craft and storage areas are located at the edges, and waste disposal areas are situated away from water sources. Using network science methods, these settlements can be abstracted as "small-world networks": dense connections within local clusters, with global connectivity achieved through a few key paths. This structure optimizes information transmission and resource distribution while enhancing system resilience—damage to one area does not affect overall operation.</p>
                
                <p>This organization experiment has striking implications for modern urban planning and algorithm design. Modern cities often face issues like traffic congestion and community segregation; the "small-world network" model of prehistoric settlements suggests that planning must balance local efficiency with global connectivity. The circular structure of Göbekli Tepe promotes face-to-face interaction, enhancing social cohesion; the zoning logic of Mesopotamian settlements optimizes production and living flows. These principles can be applied to modern community design, such as reducing commute burdens through mixed-use zoning or using public spaces as nodes to enhance social capital. Node collaboration problems in distributed computing systems (e.g., blockchain) can also draw inspiration from the self-organizing patterns of prehistoric space: encoding node roles through physical location and controlling information flow through path design, providing an "evolutionarily validated" template for algorithm design.</p>

                <h3>III. Survival Experiment: How Technological Redundancy Builds Resilience</h3>
                <p>At the Maglemose site in Denmark, a bone and antler tool made from elk antler possesses cutting, drilling, and hammering functions simultaneously, its structural complexity far exceeding daily needs. At China's Yangshao culture sites, the painted patterns on pottery surfaces clearly lack practical function. Traditional explanations often attribute these phenomena to aesthetics or religion, but perspectives from redundancy theory and resilience theory reveal: <strong>"over-engineering" was actually a systematic survival strategy for prehistoric societies coping with environmental uncertainty</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>Redundancy theory states that systems deliberately retain "excess" components to maintain stability. Within an evolutionary anthropology framework, this redundancy enhances social resilience through a triple mechanism: <strong>functional redundancy</strong> (diversification of tool types, e.g., Mousterian toolkits), <strong>skill redundancy</strong> (complexification of pottery decoration requiring mastery of multiple techniques), and <strong>cognitive redundancy</strong> (cross-domain knowledge for Maglemosian bone/antler tools). The pottery patterns at China's Jiahu site form a "visual identification system," aiding rapid recognition of object properties and accelerating post-disaster resource reorganization; the Levallois technique at Israel's Kebara site allowed pre-forming multiple tool flakes from a single core, increasing hunting success rates; Maglemosian birch bark containers deliberately叠加 asphalt coatings, increasing container韧性 by 300% under extreme cold.</p>
                
                <p>These cases show that prehistoric humans constructed deep structures for buffering risk by deliberately retaining excess functions, overstocking skills, and transmitting knowledge beyond immediate needs. This "functional redundancy" differs from waste; it is the "insurance premium" paid to uncertainty. In an uncertain world of climate change and resource fluctuations, redundant technology became key to survival.</p>
                
                <p>This survival experiment offers profound critique for contemporary technology design. Modern industrial society pursues minimal redundancy (e.g., lean production) but results in increased systemic fragility. The 2011 Thailand floods causing global HDD supply disruption is a direct consequence of over-optimized supply chains. Prehistoric communities remind us: future technology design needs to introduce "redundancy weighting" indicators, seeking a dynamic balance between efficiency and resilience. Sony's "multiple heterogeneous backup" plan for its factories after Japan's 3/11 earthquake is a modern response to prehistoric tool diversification.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion: The Three Philosophy of Technology Primal Forces and the Future of Civilization</h3>
                <p>From the stone tools of Olduvai Gorge to the spatial encoding of Göbekli Tepe, from the patterns on Yangshao pottery to the redundant design of Maglemosian tools, prehistoric sites record humanity's three major experiments with technology, space, and redundancy. These experiments reveal three underlying logics of human civilization evolution—the <strong>Three Philosophy of Technology Primal Forces</strong>:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Externalized Cognition</strong>: Technology is the extension of thought; cognition is externalized and reshaped through toolmaking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spatial Encoding</strong>: Space is the symbol of society; rules are encoded and transmitted through physical layout.</li>
                    <li><strong>Redundancy Resilience</strong>: Redundancy is the guarantee of survival; systems cope with uncertainty through excess.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>These three primal forces not only shaped prehistoric civilization but continue to influence the modern world. Artificial intelligence needs to rebuild embodied cognition, urban design needs to learn from spatial algorithms, and technological systems need to retain creative redundancy. The field of education also requires reflection: hands-on practice is not just skill training but a pathway to shaping thought patterns.</p>
                
                <p>Prehistoric sites remind us: civilization is not defined solely by writing, states, and cities, but is also founded by these silent "philosophy of technology experiments." In the digital age, as AI, the metaverse, and globalization reshape human existence, returning to sites from tens of thousands of years ago might allow us to relearn: how to design technology to carry more wisdom, inclusion, and resilience. <strong>The future of civilization remains deeply rooted in those most primitive experiments.</strong></p>
