            <h3>From "Passive Adaptation" to "Active Response": The Rise of Smart Polymers</h3>
            <h4>Definition and Development History of Smart Polymers</h4>
            <p>Smart polymers are a class of materials that can actively respond to environmental changes. These materials possess the ability to sense, react, and adapt to environmental changes, thereby achieving self-regulation and optimization of performance. Research on smart polymers began in the 1980s, initially focusing on responses to temperature, pH, and light. With the integration of nanotechnology, biotechnology, and information technology, smart polymers have gradually evolved to respond to more complex stimuli, such as electromagnetic fields, pressure, and biomolecules.</p>
            <h4>Applications of Smart Polymers</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biomedical Field</strong>: Smart polymers are widely used in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and biosensors. For example, smart drug carriers can release drugs based on changes in pH or temperature within the body, enhancing therapeutic effects and reducing side effects.</li>
                <li><strong>Electronics and Information Technology</strong>: Smart polymers are used to manufacture flexible electronic devices and sensors that can alter their electrical properties in response to external stimuli, enabling real-time monitoring and control of environmental parameters.</li>
                <li><strong>Environment and Energy</strong>: Smart hydrogels can be applied in wastewater treatment, and smart polymers are also being used to develop new energy materials, such as smart batteries and supercapacitors, improving energy storage and conversion efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Future Prospects of Smart Polymers</h4>
            <p>In the future, smart polymers will evolve towards multifunctional integration, self-healing and self-assembly, and biocompatibility and degradability. These advancements will further drive the application of smart polymers in various fields, providing new possibilities for sustainable development of human society.</p>

            <h3>From "Linear Economy" to "Circular Economy": The Future of Sustainable Polymers</h3>
            <h4>Definition and Classification of Sustainable Polymers</h4>
            <p>Sustainable polymers are polymer materials that have a minimal environmental impact during their production, use, and disposal. Based on their sources and recyclability, sustainable polymers can be categorized into bio-based polymers, biodegradable polymers, and recyclable polymers.</p>
            <h4>Advantages and Challenges of Sustainable Polymers</h4>
            <p>Compared to traditional petroleum-based polymers, sustainable polymers offer advantages such as reducing reliance on fossil fuels, minimizing environmental pollution, and promoting the development of a circular economy. However, sustainable polymers also face challenges such as higher costs, performance improvements needed, and incomplete recycling systems.</p>
            <h4>Development Trends of Sustainable Polymers</h4>
            <p>To promote the development of sustainable polymers, it is essential to strengthen technological innovation, policy support, public awareness, and industry collaboration. These efforts will enable sustainable polymers to play a significant role in the circular economy of the future, providing effective solutions to environmental crises and resource depletion.</p>
