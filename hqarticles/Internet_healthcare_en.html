        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Internet medicine, as an important component of modern medical services, is rapidly transforming traditional medical models. However, with the advancement of technology and its expanded application, internet medicine faces multiple challenges, including social equity, privacy, and changes in the doctor-patient relationship. This article explores the challenges and solutions of internet medicine from various angles, such as the digital divide, the acceptance of technology by the elderly, data privacy, doctor-patient trust, physician stress, and communication quality.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Digital Divide</h2>
            <p>The digital divide refers to the unequal distribution and use of information and communication technologies (ICT) among different social groups. In the field of internet medicine, the digital divide is mainly manifested in the disparities between urban and rural areas, income levels, and educational backgrounds.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Urban-Rural Disparity:</strong> In urban areas, internet infrastructure is relatively well-developed, and residents have a higher acceptance of internet medical services. However, in rural areas, due to insufficient infrastructure and incomplete network coverage, residents find it difficult to access internet medical services. This disparity leads to an imbalance in medical resources, further exacerbating the inequality in medical services between urban and rural areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Income Disparity:</strong> High-income groups usually have better internet devices and higher internet usage capabilities, making it easier for them to access internet medical services. Low-income groups, due to economic constraints, cannot afford the relevant devices and network fees, thus being excluded from internet medical services.</li>
                <li><strong>Educational Background Disparity:</strong> People with higher education levels usually have stronger information acquisition and processing abilities, enabling them to better understand and utilize internet medical services. Those with lower education levels may lack the relevant knowledge and skills, making it difficult for them to effectively use internet medical services.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Elderly and Technology Acceptance</h2>
            <p>The elderly are an important beneficiary group of internet medical services, but they face the most prominent challenges in using these services.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low Technology Acceptance:</strong> The elderly generally have lower acceptance of new technologies and lack experience and skills in using the internet. They may not be familiar with operating smartphones, computers, and other devices, making it difficult for them to independently complete online appointments, video consultations, and other tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Single Information Channel:</strong> The elderly rely mainly on traditional media and word-of-mouth from relatives and friends for information. They may not be aware of the advantages and usage methods of internet medicine, thus missing out on the opportunity to enjoy internet medical services.</li>
                <li><strong>Psychological Barriers:</strong> The elderly may have psychological barriers to internet medical services, worrying about the safety and privacy protection of online consultations, and thus being unwilling to try internet medical services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Privacy and Security</h2>
            <p>With the development of internet medicine, the digitization of a large amount of sensitive health data has made privacy and data security issues increasingly prominent.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Privacy Regulations:</strong> Many countries and regions around the world have enacted a series of regulations to protect users' data privacy, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the United States' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). In China, the Cybersecurity Law and the Personal Information Protection Law provide a legal basis for the protection of internet medical data.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Safeguards:</strong> At the technical level, data encryption and access control are important means to ensure data security. Blockchain technology and artificial intelligence technology also play important roles in data security. By analyzing user behavior and data flow, AI can timely detect and prevent potential security threats.</li>
                <li><strong>User Education:</strong> User education is an important link in ensuring data privacy. Through publicity and education, the awareness of data privacy among users is enhanced, and users' self-protection awareness is strengthened. Medical institutions and platforms should formulate transparent privacy policies to clearly inform users of the methods and measures for data use and protection.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Changes in Doctor-Patient Relationship</h2>
            <p>Internet medicine is profoundly changing the traditional doctor-patient relationship, bringing new challenges in areas such as patient trust, physician stress, and communication quality.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Patient Trust:</strong> In internet medicine, the interaction between patients and doctors is mainly conducted through screens, which to some extent weakens the establishment of trust. Internet medical platforms provide detailed information about doctors, patient reviews, and case analyses to help patients understand the professional background and treatment effectiveness of doctors, thereby enhancing patient trust.</li>
                <li><strong>Physician Stress:</strong> The popularization of internet medicine has greatly increased doctors' workload. Doctors need to handle both offline patients and online consultations and diagnoses. This dual pressure further compresses doctors' working hours, increasing the risk of job burnout. Additionally, doctors need to continuously learn and master new medical technologies and knowledge to cope with the new challenges brought by internet medicine.</li>
                <li><strong>Communication Quality:</strong> Internet medicine provides convenient communication methods, but the depth and quality of communication still face certain challenges. In online consultations, the interaction between doctors and patients is mainly conducted through screens, lacking face-to-face interaction and emotional exchange. This virtual communication method may affect doctors' comprehensive understanding of patients' conditions, especially when dealing with complex diseases, doctors need to obtain comprehensive disease information through multiple communications and feedback.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Policy Support</h2>
            <p>To promote the social equity, privacy, and harmonious development of the doctor-patient relationship in internet medicine, policy support is crucial. The government and various sectors of society need to take multiple measures to narrow the digital divide, improve the technological acceptance of the elderly, ensure data privacy and security, reduce physicians' work pressure, and improve the quality and depth of communication.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure Construction:</strong> The government should increase investment in internet infrastructure in rural areas to ensure that all regions can enjoy stable and fast network services. Additionally, the cost of internet devices and network fees should be reduced to make internet medical services affordable for low-income groups.</li>
                <li><strong>Education and Training:</strong> By carrying out popular science education and skills training on internet medicine, the information literacy and technological acceptance of the public, especially the elderly, can be improved. Communities and medical institutions can organize relevant training courses to help the elderly master the use of internet medical services.</li>
                <li><strong>Policy Guidance:</strong> Formulate and implement relevant policies and standards for internet medical services to ensure the quality and safety of internet medical services. The government can provide subsidies and tax incentives to encourage medical institutions and enterprises to provide internet medical services, especially for the elderly and low-income groups.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Support:</strong> Encourage various sectors of society to participate in the promotion and popularization of internet medicine, especially in supporting vulnerable groups. Volunteer organizations can provide technical support and assistance to help the elderly and low-income groups better utilize internet medical services.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
