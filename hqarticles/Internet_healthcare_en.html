                <p>In 2023, genetic testing company 23andMe licensed its user genetic database to pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for $150 million for drug development. The legality of this transaction was based on the privacy policy signed by usersâ€”an 8,000-word text where clause 12.3 mentioned: "Your anonymized data may be used for commercial partnerships but will not be directly linked to your identity." However, when GSK used this data to develop new drugs and sold them for $30,000 per year, the patients who contributed the data could not obtain treatment at any discount. This reveals the most hidden exploitation chain in internet healthcare: <strong>patients donate data in the name of "promoting public health," only to end up as "raw material suppliers" in the commercial value chain</strong>.</p>

                <h3>I. The Hidden Path of Data Commercialization: From Philanthropy to Exploitation</h3>
                <p>The commercial use of patient data typically goes through three stages:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Initial Collection through "Philanthropic Narrative"</strong><br>
                        Platforms attract patients to join with slogans like "fighting diseases together." For example, the rare disease social network PatientsLikeMe initially positioned itself as a "patient mutual aid community," encouraging users to share medical conditions, medication records, and genetic data. Its founder stated in a 2010 interview: "Our goal is to make patients feel less alone." However, after the platform was acquired by a private equity company in 2018, its database was sold to pharmaceutical companies for drug pricing and market segmentation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data "Laundering" and Value-Adding</strong><br>
                        Patient data is anonymized and packaged as "desensitized datasets" for sale. For instance, 23andMe cross-references user genetic data with third-party health data (such as Fitbit exercise records) to generate "high-value data packages" for pharmaceutical companies to bid on. In 2022, a package covering genetic and lifestyle data of 500,000 diabetes patients was sold for $28 million, without the patients' knowledge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structural Inequality in Value Distribution</strong><br>
                        Data is ultimately transformed into drugs, insurance pricing, or precision marketing tools, but the contributors are excluded from the benefits. For example:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Drug Development</strong>: GSK's cancer drug developed using 23andMe data is priced at $120,000 per year, yet data contributors receive no discount;</li>
                            <li><strong>Insurance Actuarial</strong>: US insurance companies purchased PatientsLikeMe data to increase premiums for certain rare disease patients by 300%, citing "data indicating high risk for this group";</li>
                            <li><strong>Ad Targeting</strong>: Genetic testing company Ancestry sold user data to nutritional supplement companies, which then targeted users with high-priced supplements, leading patients to overconsume due to trust in "personalized recommendations."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>II. The Illusion of Informed Consent: When Privacy Policies Become Tools for "Legal Exploitation"</h3>
                <p>The legitimacy of patient data exploitation is built on the fragile ethical foundation of "informed consent." However, this mechanism has become a formality in practice:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The "Black Hole" Effect of Privacy Policies</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>23andMe's privacy policy is 8,000 words long, with clauses about data commercialization scattered across sections 12, 23, and 34, using legal terminology (e.g., "derived data products," "third-party processors") to obfuscate data flow;</li>
                            <li>PatientsLikeMe's user agreement includes an "irrevocable data" clause, meaning that even if users delete their accounts, data may still be retained for commercial analysis.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The False Promise of Anonymization</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Research shows that 87% of "anonymized" health data can be re-identified by cross-referencing public datasets (e.g., social media, shopping records);</li>
                            <li>In 2021, a cancer patient discovered their PatientsLikeMe data was used for an insurance company's risk assessment. Despite the data being "anonymized," the insurer could still identify them based on their rare disease type and medication records.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>"Forced Consent" Among Vulnerable Groups</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Low-income patients are more likely to ignore privacy risks due to the lure of "free services." For example, a diabetes management APP offered free glucose meters but required users to upload all glucose data, which was then sold to insurance companies for pricing;</li>
                            <li>Rare disease patients, eager to find treatments, are more inclined to share data without fully understanding the terms. PatientsLikeMe data shows that rare disease patients upload three times more data than common disease patients, yet their data is commercially utilized 40% more frequently.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>III. Possible Paths to Data Justice: From Exploitation to Sharing</h3>
                <p>To break this cycle of exploitation, we need to restructure data ownership and benefit distribution mechanisms through institutional design:</p>
                
                <h4>1. Data Cooperative Model: Patients as Data Shareholders</h4>
                <p>Drawing on the experience of Iceland's DeCode genetic project, establish patient-led data cooperatives:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data as Shares</strong>: Patients contribute data as "shares" to the cooperative, retaining veto power over data usage;</li>
                    <li><strong>Profit Sharing</strong>: When data is commercially used, patients receive profits proportional to their contributions. For example, 30% of profits from a 2022 Icelandic genetic study were returned to data contributors;</li>
                    <li><strong>Governance Participation</strong>: Cooperatives establish patient representative committees to review data usage applications, ensuring alignment with public health goals.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Implementation Barriers</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Corporate Resistance: Pharmaceutical companies may lobby against legislation or shift to purchasing non-cooperative data;</li>
                    <li>Technical Barriers: Vulnerable groups may lack the capacity to participate in cooperative governance, leading to "data elitism."</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>2. Health Data Tax: Redistributing Data Dividends</h4>
                <p>Impose a special tax on health data transactions to fund public medical benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tax Base Design</strong>: Levy a 10%-20% tax on data transaction amounts. For example, the $150 million transaction between 23andMe and GSK would incur a $15-30 million tax;</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage Specifications</strong>: Tax revenue is dedicated to rare disease research, medical subsidies for low-income patients, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Ethical Controversies</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>May inhibit data flow, slowing medical research progress;</li>
                    <li>Need to balance tax rates with innovation incentives to prevent companies from shifting to overseas data markets.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>3. Mandatory Data Transparency: Breaking the "Black Box" Exploitation</h4>
                <p>Legislate requiring companies to disclose data flow and usage details:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Flow Tracking</strong>: Patients can query which institutions use their data and for what purposes;</li>
                    <li><strong>Algorithm Transparency</strong>: Companies must disclose the core logic of data analysis models to avoid discriminatory uses (e.g., insurance pricing).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Case Reference</strong>: The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) already requires some data transparency, but enforcement in the health data field still has loopholes.</p>

                <h3>IV. Conclusion: The Ultimate Question of Data Justice</h3>
                <p>The exploitation of patient data is essentially a form of <strong>"digital colonialism"</strong>â€”companies from developed nations extract data from global patients, transform it into high-priced drugs and services, while contributors are excluded from the benefits. To break this cycle, we must move beyond technological solutionism and address more fundamental issues:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Redefining Data Ownership</strong>: Should data be considered a "product of labor" rather than a "free resource"?</li>
                    <li><strong>Redistributing Health Value</strong>: When data is transformed into drugs or insurance products, should patients have priority rights to benefits?</li>
                    <li><strong>Institutionalizing Tech Ethics</strong>: How can "data justice" be integrated into the core principles of medical innovation, rather than being an afterthought?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Only then can patients transition from "digital paupers" to <strong>rights-bearing subjects</strong> in the health data ecosystem, rather than exploited "raw materials."</p>
            </section>

            <section class="critical-reflection">
                <h3>Critical Reflection</h3>
                <p>As patient data is capitalized into "digital gold," are we witnessing a new form of "data colonialism"? True data justice may not lie in stricter privacy terms, but in redefining the ownership and value distribution of health dataâ€”data should not be a "free resource" for corporations but a "product of labor" for patients. In this process, we must guard against both techno-determinism and anti-technology extremes, acknowledging the role of data sharing in medical progress while firmly opposing development models that sacrifice individual rights. The core of health data justice is to establish a fairer, more transparent, and democratic data governance system, ensuring every data contributor receives due dignity andå›žæŠ¥ (reward/return) in technological advancement.</p>
