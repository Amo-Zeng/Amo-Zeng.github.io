            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Renaissance, widely hailed as the most glorious cultural movement in European history, was far from merely a simple revival of classical culture. As we delve through the layers of history, exploring its art, science, and social thought, we find it to be more of a "masquerade" across time and space, where people, masked in the grand cultural carnival, sought and constructed new social identities. Additionally, the profound transformation from "human dissection" to "self-dissection," along with its "globalization" resonance, reveals that the Renaissance was not only a regional cultural revival but also a global fusion of thoughts and civilizations.</p>

            <h3>Masks in Portraits: Metaphors of Social Identity</h3>
            <p>The frequent appearance of masks in Renaissance portraits is striking. Whether noble, artist, or emerging bourgeois, they chose to wear masks in their portraits, expressing their identities and status. These masks in portraits were not just decorations but metaphors, symbolizing the complex inner world and social roles of those depicted. For example, in Sandro Botticelli's "Portrait of a Young Man," the protagonist wears a fine mask, its patterns complementing his attire, seemingly narrating his identity and taste. Yet, the protagonist's eyes behind the mask reveal a hint of confusion and unease, as if questioning his true identity. This contrast reflects the social identity anxiety of the time, revealing the desire to find self-positioning amidst social changes.</p>
            <p>The use of masks was not only a tribute to classical culture but also a confirmation of the new bourgeois identity. The rise of humanism awakened individuals' self-awareness, making people begin to focus on their inner values and uniqueness. However, the emergence of the new bourgeoisie complicated the definition of social identity, as traditional nobility and the new bourgeoisie both competed and merged. In this context, masks became a way to express the self, allowing people to hide their true selves to a certain extent while constructing idealized social images.</p>

            <h3>From "Human Dissection" to "Self-Dissection": Exploring Life and Existence Philosophy</h3>
            <p>The study of human anatomy reached unprecedented heights during the Renaissance. Scientists and artists began to openly dissect human bodies to obtain more accurate knowledge of human structures. The achievements in anatomy not only propelled the development of medicine but also brought revolutionary impacts to art creation. For example, Leonardo da Vinci, through precise anatomical research, drew a large number of human anatomy diagrams, which became important references for later artists and medical research.</p>
            <p>Artists' analysis of the human body was not just a depiction of the flesh but also an exploration of the soul. They infused deep understanding of human nature into their creations, conveying philosophical thoughts on life and existence through art. For instance, Michelangelo's sculpture "David" precisely captures the muscles and bones of the human body, creating a heroic image full of strength and beauty, a significant breakthrough in the art world at the time, reflecting human pursuit of beauty and admiration for strength.</p>
            <p>The influence of humanist thought led people to focus on their inner emotions and thoughts, expressing themselves through literature, art, and philosophy to achieve profound self-cognition. For example, Petrarch's poetry expressed personal feelings and thoughts on self-existence, becoming an important manifestation of individualism during the Renaissance. "Self-dissection" is not just an analysis of the flesh and soul but a comprehensive cognition of the self, society, and even the universe. People during the Renaissance achieved a deep understanding of the world through various forms of "dissection," laying the foundation for later intellectual liberation.</p>

            <h3>The Renaissance in a Global Perspective: A Symphony of Diverse Civilizations</h3>
            <p>Traditionally, the Renaissance has often been confined to Italy, seen as a cultural revival movement originating in Italy. However, when viewed from a global perspective, it becomes clear that the Renaissance was far from limited to Italy, but rather a cultural movement influenced by diverse civilizations and resonating globally. Renaissance Italy was not an isolated cultural island but maintained close cultural exchanges with various civilizations worldwide.</p>
            <p>The collapse of the Byzantine Empire in the 15th century led to the migration of many scholars and artists to Italy, bringing precious ancient Greek and Roman documents. These documents provided rich academic resources for Renaissance scholars, especially the philosophical thoughts of Aristotle, Plato, and others, greatly inspiring Italian humanists. Arab civilization achieved outstanding accomplishments in mathematics, medicine, and astronomy. The spread of Arabic numerals benefited Italian calculations and commercial transactions. Arab medical works like Avicenna's "Canon of Medicine" provided valuable knowledge to Renaissance doctors, propelling the development of European medicine.</p>
            <p>Chinese papermaking and printing techniques were transmitted to the Arab world via the Silk Road and then to Europe. Papermaking greatly reduced the cost of book production, making knowledge dissemination more accessible, laying the foundation for academic prosperity during the Renaissance. The advent of printing accelerated the spread of knowledge, promoting the popularization of Renaissance ideas. Renaissance thoughts and works did not remain confined to Italy but spread to other parts of Europe and the distant East through trade, mission, and other means, profoundly impacting local cultures. For example, Venetian merchants spread Renaissance works and ideas to Northern and Eastern Europe through trade, stimulating local cultural revivals.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In summary, the Renaissance was not only a revival of classical culture but also a "masquerade" across time and space, where people explored and constructed new social identities while wearing masks. The profound transformation from "human dissection" to "self-dissection" reflects human's deep understanding and infinite pursuit of themselves and the universe. Viewed from a global perspective, the Renaissance was a cultural movement influenced by diverse civilizations and reverberating globally. From Byzantium, the Arab world to China, the Renaissance drew rich inspiration from interactions between different civilizations and spread its influence worldwide through trade, mission, and other ways, profoundly impacting local cultures. This period of cultural exchange not only brought cultural revival to Europe but also laid the groundwork for later geographical discoveries and global integration. Therefore, the Renaissance was not just a cultural revival but also a "globalization" resonance, injecting new vitality into human civilization's progress and development.</p>
