            <h2>Blurring Cultural Transparency and Cultural Entrapment in the Digital Era: Reconstruction of Subjectivity and Value in Cross-cultural Communication</h2>
            <p>Under the dual drive of globalization and rapid development of digital technology, cross-cultural communication is undergoing unprecedented transformation. The ideal of cultural transparency and the phenomenon of cultural cocoon in the digital era, though seemingly contradictory, together reveal the deep-seated困境 in cross-cultural communication: the loss of subjectivity and the urgent need for value reconstruction. This article will explore how to achieve subjectivity reconstruction and value reconstruction in cross-cultural communication, by taking cultural transparency, digital cultural cocoon, and cultural innovation as entry points, thereby opening up a more inclusive and creative path for cultural interaction.</p>

            <h3>The Myth of Cultural Transparency and the Reconstruction of Subjectivity</h3>
            <p>The concept of cultural transparency has been highly anticipated in the context of globalization, as if through the advancement of communication technology, different cultures can be presented to the world in their "original and authentic" forms. However, this pursuit itself is a theoretical illusion. Culture is not a static symbol system, but a complex, multidimensional, and constantly evolving dynamic process. The so-called "original and pure" cultural forms are actually an illusionary ideal state. In globalized communication, the representation and dissemination of culture inevitably involve processes of selection, reconstruction, and reproduction.</p>
            <p>The pursuit of cultural transparency from a Western-centric perspective often imposes Western standards on non-Western cultures, forming a new cultural hegemony. For example, the "mystery of Pharaohs" in Egypt or the "Samurai spirit" in Japan, though presented as "authentic cultural representations," have actually undergone careful selection and reconstruction. This unidirectional demand for transparency not only fails to promote cultural understanding but also deepens misunderstandings and alienation. Moreover, this pursuit conceals the lack of subjectivity in communication.</p>
            <p>In cross-cultural communication, both communicators and audiences are in a fluid cultural identity, needing to reposition themselves through interaction. For instance, the works of Chinese-American director Ang Lee or contemporary creations by African artists demonstrate the process of subjectivity reconstruction in cultural communication. These cases indicate that the key to cross-cultural communication lies not in pursuing illusory transparency, but in maintaining subjectivity and achieving creative transformation in cultural interaction.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Entrapment in the Digital Era and the Revival of the Tower of Babel</h3>
            <p>In today's highly developed digital technology, the speed and breadth of information flow have reached unprecedented levels. However, instead of achieving "global harmony," we have fallen into an unprecedented "cultural cocoon." The precise push of algorithm recommendation systems immerses us in our preferred cultural spaces, creating a dilemma similar to Baudelaire's "modernity prisoners." The uniformity of content on short video platforms and the echo chamber effect on social media are subtly changing the essence of cross-cultural communication.</p>
            <p>The cultural cocoon in the digital era is not merely a technological product, but the result of a joint effect of human nature and technology. We instinctively seek the security of cultural identity and reject heterogeneous cognition, a psychological mechanism that is infinitely amplified by algorithms. This cultural entrapment phenomenon, like the revival of the ancient "Tower of Babel" dilemma: the information superhighway connects the earth into an integral whole, yet cultural differences have not diminished; instead, they have generated new barriers due to the convenience of communication. Cultural disputes on social media and ideological confrontations in cyberspace all tell the same truth: digital technology is not a catalyst for cultural fusion but an amplifier of cultural differences.</p>
            <p>Deconstructing this cultural cocoon requires us to re-examine the essence of cross-cultural communication. The core of communication lies in the sharing of meaning between individuals, while in the digital cocoon, this process is being replaced by the solidification of meaning. To break this dilemma, both technological wisdom and human awakening are needed. This is not only about the liberation of individual cognition but also about the future direction of human civilization.</p>

            <h3>The Boundaries of Cultural Appropriation and Cultural Innovation: Multidimensional Dialogue for Value Reconstruction</h3>
            <p>Driven by globalization and digital technology, the boundaries between cultural appropriation and cultural innovation have become increasingly blurred. Take the "Western-style church in Chinese landscape" exhibited in the Vienna Chinese painting exhibition as an example: critics view it as a "betrayal" of Eastern art, while supporters see it as a model of artistic innovation. This controversy reflects the core dilemma in cross-cultural communication: how to achieve genuine value creation in the flow of culture?</p>
            <p>Cultural appropriation often treats heterogeneous cultures as static symbol systems, engaging in superficial and hasty replication and transformation. This behavior essentially objectifies other cultures, reducing them to consumable cultural commodities. In contrast, cultural innovation regards culture as a fluid living entity, achieving value enhancement and transcendence through creative transformation in cross-cultural dialogue. The creation of Dunhuang murals is a typical example: artists, in deep dialogue with Indian and Persian cultures, created a unique "Chinese Buddhist art" that preserves the essence of foreign cultures while infusing it with local cultural connotations.</p>
            <p>The value reconstruction in cross-cultural communication requires creators to possess higher cultural awareness and creative transformation abilities. Xu Bing's "Book from the Sky" is an example: by rethinking Chinese characters, he achieved a profound dialogue between tradition and modernity, East and West. This innovation respects cultural diversity and realizes value reconstruction through dialogue.</p>
            <p>In the contemporary context, the value reconstruction in cross-cultural communication involves three dimensions: Firstly, deep understanding of the cultural ontology, requiring creators to truly enter the core of other cultures; Secondly, the ability of creative transformation, integrating foreign elements organically into the local context; Finally, innovative value concepts, achieving the elevation of the human spiritual world through cultural dialogue.</p>

            <h3>The Future of Cross-cultural Communication: Co-creation of Subjectivity and Value</h3>
            <p>Under the dual background of globalization and the digital era, the core issue of cross-cultural communication is no longer a simple pursuit of transparency or breaking the cultural cocoon, but how to achieve the co-creation of subjectivity and value in cultural interaction. This requires us to abandon the obsession with transparency in both theoretical and practical levels, and instead focus on humanistic value, creativity, and intersubjectivity in cultural communication.</p>
            <p>The future of cross-cultural communication should create new cultural forms and value paradigms on the basis of respecting differences, injecting new vitality into human civilization. This not only requires technological improvements but also the cultivation of cultural awareness and the spirit of innovation. When we maintain reverence for cultural diversity in digital technology and achieve creative transformation in cultural dialogue, cross-cultural communication can truly fulfill its mission of promoting cultural understanding and enhancing human well-being.</p>
            <p>In this sense, cross-cultural communication is not merely an academic discussion, but a profound proposition concerning the future direction of human civilization. By re-constructing the subjectivity framework and value reconstruction path of cross-cultural communication, we are有望 to open up a more open, inclusive, and creative new path for cultural communication, injecting new vitality into the future of human civilization.</p>
