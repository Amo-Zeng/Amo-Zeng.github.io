            <h3>1. Quantum Noise Encryption: From Interference to Resource</h3>
            <p>Quantum noise is often seen as a disadvantage in quantum communication, but in recent years, researchers have discovered that its unpredictability and high entropy can be used as a powerful encryption resource. The core idea of <strong>quantum noise encryption</strong> is to use quantum noise to generate random keys or masks, which are then combined with plaintext to generate ciphertext. Due to the unpredictability of quantum noise, even if an attacker intercepts the ciphertext, it cannot be decrypted using traditional methods.</p>
            
            <h4>Advantages and Innovations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>True Unpredictability</strong>: Quantum noise originates from the inherent randomness of quantum systems, effectively resisting attacks from quantum computers.</li>
                <li><strong>High Entropy</strong>: The entropy of quantum noise is much higher than that of traditional pseudo-random numbers, providing stronger information masking.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Power Consumption and Efficient Deployment</strong>: Suitable for resource-constrained scenarios such as IoT devices and mobile terminals.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Technical Challenges</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Noise Extraction and Synchronization</strong>: How to efficiently extract noise and ensure synchronization between sender and receiver.</li>
                <li><strong>Noise Stability</strong>: Quantum noise may be affected by environmental interference, requiring stability and consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Standardization and Protocol Design</strong>: No unified standards and protocols have been established yet.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Looking ahead, quantum noise encryption is expected to become an important supplement in the field of information security, providing new ideas for the integration of classical and quantum communication.</p>

            <h3>2. Quantum Encryption and Trusted AI: Building Security Barriers for Algorithm Models</h3>
            <p>As AI is increasingly applied in critical fields such as healthcare, defense, and finance, the security vulnerabilities of models have become a major threat. The combination of quantum encryption and trusted AI provides a breakthrough solution to this dilemma.</p>
            
            <h4>Quantum-Level Challenges in AI Model Security</h4>

                <li><strong>Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)</strong>: Such as lattice-based encryption algorithms, resistant to quantum computing attacks.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Technical Coupling Paths</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Protection</strong>: In federated learning, use QKD to assign temporary keys to nodes, encrypting model gradients with "one-time pad" encryption.</li>
                <li><strong>Static Reinforcement</strong>: Use PQC algorithms to encrypt pre-trained models stored in the cloud, preventing data theft.</li>
