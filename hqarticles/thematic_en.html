            <h2>Integration of AI with Affective Computing</h2>
            <p>Affective computing, as a significant branch of AI, aims to enable machines to perceive, understand, express, and simulate human emotions. Through this technology, AI systems can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhance User Interaction Experience</strong>: By recognizing and responding to the user's emotional state, AI can provide more personalized and humane services. For instance, in education, an emotionally intelligent system can adjust teaching content and methods according to the student's mood, thereby improving learning efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhance Emotional Intelligence</strong>: AI can learn from emotional data to reach human-level performance in emotion recognition and generation, facilitating robots to offer emotional care in home and medical settings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, affective computing also faces challenges such as data privacy, the complexity of emotions, and technological limitations. In the future, AI systems will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multimodal Information Fusion</strong>: Combine visual, auditory, and tactile information sources to enhance the understanding of human emotions.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized Emotional Models</strong>: Develop models that adapt to individual differences in emotional expression.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Ethical Decision Mechanisms in AI</h2>
            <p>As AI plays an increasingly important role in society, its ethical decision mechanisms have become a critical issue:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complexity of Ethical Decision Making</strong>: AI faces moral dilemmas like the "trolley problem," requiring it to balance multiple interests, consider cultural differences, and adhere to social norms.</li>
                <li><strong>Programming Ethics</strong>: Embedding ethical principles into AI algorithms is central. This includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Choosing an Ethical Framework</strong>: Determining which ethical system AI should follow.</li>
                        <li><strong>Eliminating Data Bias</strong>: Ensuring training data is free from biases to prevent unfair AI decisions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transparency and Interpretability</strong>: Making AI decision processes transparent and understandable.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Regulation and Legal Frameworks</strong>: A global unified standard for AI ethics is needed to avoid moral conflicts across different cultural backgrounds. Additionally, technical solutions like:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>: Allowing AI to learn ethical decision-making through trial and error.</li>
                        <li><strong>Multi-Agent Systems</strong>: Simulating human society interactions to explore ethical decisions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ethical AI</strong>: Developing AI systems specifically for ethical decision-making.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>AI's Role in Environmental and Ecological Conservation</h2>
            <p>AI has shown tremendous potential in environmental protection:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Predicting Climate Change</strong>: Through big data analysis and climate modeling, AI can forecast climate trends and provide disaster warnings.</li>
                <li><strong>Biodiversity Conservation</strong>: AI helps protect endangered species and ecosystems through species recognition and preventing poaching.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Management and Sustainable Development</strong>: AI applications in agriculture, waste management, and energy use promote sustainability. For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Precision Agriculture</strong>: Using AI to optimize agricultural production and reduce resource wastage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Smart Waste Sorting</strong>: Improving waste sorting and recycling efficiency with AI.</li>
                        <li><strong>Energy Optimization</strong>: AI assists in optimizing energy consumption and production.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Public Engagement and Education</strong>: AI enhances public awareness of environmental issues through analysis of social media and interactive educational platforms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While AI's application in environmental protection is hopeful, it also faces challenges such as data quality, technological costs, and ethical governance.</p>
