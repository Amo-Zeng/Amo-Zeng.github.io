            <h3>1. Integration of Carbon Sequestration and Urban Greening</h3>
            <h4>1.1 Vertical Forests</h4>
            <p>Vertical forests are an innovative way of planting trees and plants on the exterior walls of buildings. This design not only increases the green space in cities but also effectively absorbs carbon dioxide and reduces the urban heat island effect. For example, the "Vertical Forest" project in Milan, Italy, is a successful case. Designed by architect Stefano Boeri, the two residential buildings have over 900 trees and 2,000 plants planted on their exterior walls, absorbing about 22 tons of carbon dioxide annually.</p>
            <h4>1.2 Roof Gardens</h4>
            <p>Roof gardens are another effective way of urban greening. By planting plants on the roofs of buildings, not only can carbon dioxide be absorbed, but the energy consumption of buildings can also be reduced, and the urban heat island effect can be mitigated. Singapore's "Garden City" initiative is a typical example. The Singapore government encourages planting plants on the roofs and balconies of buildings, not only beautifying the urban environment but also improving the quality of life for residents.</p>
            <h4>1.3 Urban Parks and Green Belts</h4>
            <p>Urban parks and green belts are important components of urban greening. By building more parks and green belts in cities, more green spaces can be provided, carbon dioxide can be absorbed, and air quality can be improved. For example, Central Park in New York City is not only a great place for recreation but also absorbs a significant amount of carbon dioxide annually, providing fresh air for city residents.</p>

            <h3>6. Interdisciplinary Innovation in Carbon Sequestration Technology</h3>
            <p>Carbon sequestration technology, as a key means to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, has received unprecedented attention. However, carbon sequestration is not just an issue of environmental science or engineering technology; it also involves materials science, chemistry, biology, and other fields. The integration of interdisciplinary research not only brings new breakthroughs to carbon sequestration technology but also provides new paths to achieving sustainable development goals.</p>
            <h4>6.1 Application of Materials Science in Carbon Sequestration</h4>
            <p>The application of materials science in carbon sequestration technology mainly focuses on developing new adsorbents and catalysts to improve carbon capture efficiency. For example, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are ideal carbon dioxide adsorbents due to their high specific surface area and adjustable pore structure. These materials not only have a large adsorption capacity but also excellent regeneration performance, significantly reducing the cost of carbon capture.</p>
            <p>Additionally, nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene are used to develop efficient carbon capture systems. These materials have excellent electrical and mechanical properties, improving the stability and efficiency of the carbon capture process.</p>
            <h4>6.2 Innovation in Chemistry for Carbon Sequestration</h4>
            <p>Innovations in chemistry focus on developing efficient carbon fixation and conversion technologies. For example, converting carbon dioxide into valuable chemicals and fuels through chemical reactions can not only reduce carbon dioxide emissions but also create economic value. Common chemical conversion methods include methanation, methanol synthesis, and the formation of carbonates.</p>
            <p>In recent years, photocatalysis and electrocatalysis have shown great potential in carbon fixation. Photocatalysts such as titanium dioxide (TiO2) and electrocatalysts such as copper-based catalysts can reduce carbon dioxide to high-value chemicals like methanol and methane under mild conditions. These technologies not only improve the efficiency of carbon fixation but also reduce energy consumption and costs.</p>
            <h4>6.3 Application of Biotechnology in Carbon Sequestration</h4>
            <p>Biotechnology uses the natural metabolic processes of microorganisms and plants to fix and convert carbon dioxide. For example, algae and cyanobacteria can efficiently absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and convert it into biomass. This biomass can be further processed into high-value products such as biofuels and bioplastics.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the development of genetic engineering and synthetic biology provides new avenues to improve the efficiency of biological carbon fixation. Through genetic editing, microbial metabolic pathways can be optimized to fix carbon dioxide more efficiently. For example, researchers have significantly improved the carbon dioxide fixation ability of cyanobacteria by modifying their photosynthetic pathways.</p>
            <h4>6.4 Mechanisms and Models for Interdisciplinary Collaboration</h4>
            <p>Interdisciplinary collaboration is key to advancing carbon sequestration technology.
