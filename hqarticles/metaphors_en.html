            <h3>I. Metaphor as a Bridge for Technological Cognition: Analogical Thinking in Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <p>In the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive science, metaphor is not just a linguistic phenomenon but a core tool for constructing technological systems and understanding complex abstract concepts. Through analogical thinking, metaphor maps known concepts to unknown domains, helping humans and technological systems establish cognitive connections. This mechanism not only shapes the development path of AI but also profoundly influences the understanding and acceptance of technology by the public and practitioners.</p>
            
            <h4>1. How Do AI Systems Learn Human Semantic Networks Through Analogy and Metaphor?</h4>
            <p>One of the core tasks of AI systems is to understand and generate human language, a process that relies heavily on metaphor and analogical thinking. Human language is filled with metaphors, such as "time is money" or "thought is food," which help people understand and express complex ideas by linking abstract concepts to concrete experiences. In natural language processing (NLP), AI systems analyze vast amounts of text data to learn these metaphorical patterns and apply them to semantic understanding and generation.</p>
            
            <h4>2. How Does the Metaphorical Nature of Technical Terms Influence Public and Practitioner Understanding?</h4>
            <p>In the field of AI, many technical terms are themselves products of metaphor. For example, the term "neural network" maps the structure and function of biological neurons to computer models, helping people understand complex computational processes. Similarly, "deep learning" uses the spatial metaphor of "depth" to describe the multi-layered structure of models and their ability to abstract data layer by layer. These metaphorical terms serve as bridges in technology communication, making complex scientific concepts more accessible to the public and practitioners.</p>
            
            <h4>3. How Does Metaphor Serve as a Cognitive Interface in Human-Computer Interaction?</h4>
            <p>In human-computer interaction (HCI), metaphor plays a crucial role as a cognitive interface. By mapping familiar human experiences to technological systems, metaphor allows users to intuitively understand and use complex AI technologies. For example, the "desktop" metaphor in graphical user interfaces (GUI) analogizes computer operations to physical office environments, enabling users to interact with the system naturally through actions like dragging files and opening folders.</p>

            <h3>II. Metaphor and Social Emotion Shaping: "Emotional Metaphors" in Social Media</h3>
            <p>In the digital age, social media is not only a platform for information dissemination but also a space for emotional exchange and collective psychological construction. Metaphor—a traditional rhetorical device—has been revitalized in the digital context, becoming an essential tool for conveying emotions, constructing attitudes, and even mobilizing collective behavior. From "collapse" and "suffocation" to "crazy literature," emotional metaphors in online language not only reflect the psychological state of contemporary youth but also shape the collective expression and dissemination of social emotions. Behind this phenomenon of "emotional metaphors" lies the deep operation of social psychological mechanisms and a new paradigm of emotional communication in the digital media era.</p>
            
            <h4>1. The Social Psychological Mechanism of Emotional Metaphors</h4>
            <p>Emotional metaphor terms frequently appearing on social media (e.g., "mental breakdown," "workplace suffocation," "emo") may seem like personal emotional outbursts but are actually projections of group psychology. These metaphors share the characteristic of concretizing abstract emotions, using analogies to bodily sensations or extreme situations (e.g., "suffocation" implying oppression, "collapse" conveying a sense of loss of control) to lower the threshold for emotional expression while enhancing the infectiousness of communication. The theory of "embodied cognition" in psychology explains this phenomenon: when people use metaphors related to physiological experiences, they can more quickly activate empathy mechanisms, triggering collective emotional resonance.</p>
            
            <h4>2. The Path of Emotional Metaphor Dissemination: Memeification and Algorithmic Amplification</h4>
            <p>The spread of emotional metaphors relies on two digital characteristics: the viral dissemination of memes and algorithmic emotional preferences. Research shows that metaphorical expressions receive higher sharing rates than direct statements (Twitter data indicates that "drowning in work" is shared 47% more than "I'm very busy"). This is because metaphors create "cognitive gaps," forcing the audience to complete the meaning through association, which enhances information stickiness. When metaphors like "can't keep up" or "lying flat" are simplified into tag-like expressions, they quickly evolve into emotional memes, forming "shortcuts" for social emotions through fragmented dissemination.</p>
            
            <h4>3. Tracking Metaphors from a Big Data Perspective: Semantic Networks and Emotion Prediction</h4>
            <p>Identifying the evolution of emotional metaphors requires going beyond traditional text analysis to build multi-dimensional semantic recognition models. By using pre-trained models like BERT to analyze the contextual embedding of metaphorical words, researchers can observe semantic shifts—for example, the term "suffocation" has gradually migrated from medical contexts to workplace discussions since 2020 (increasing from 12% to 68%), revealing a shift in social anxiety. Through social network analysis (SNA), researchers can track the diffusion paths of specific metaphors—for instance, the term "involution" in Chinese social media shows a "stepwise penetration" from university forums to workplace communities.</p>

            <h3>III. The Political Nature of Metaphor: Rhetorical Tools for Ideological Reconstruction</h3>
            <p>The use of metaphor in political discourse is not merely a rhetorical device but also an ideological tool. By simplifying complex social phenomena into easily understandable images, it naturalizes certain positions, obscures real contradictions, and thereby shapes public perception and constructs power relations.</p>
            
            <h4>1. The "Conceptual Framework" Function of Metaphor</h4>
            <p>The core function of metaphor lies in its ability to concretize abstract concepts by mapping one domain of experience to another, allowing people to understand unfamiliar things in familiar ways. In political discourse, this "conceptual framework" function is skillfully utilized to guide public understanding and attitudes toward specific issues. For example, the metaphor "fighting the pandemic is a war" not only emphasizes the severity and urgency of the pandemic but also implies the need for decisive, tough measures, thereby legitimizing government actions like emergency states and restrictions on personal freedom.</p>
            
            <h4>2. The Relationship Between Metaphor and Discursive Power</h4>
            <p>The use of metaphor is not just a linguistic choice but also an expression of discursive power. Whoever has the authority to define the rationality of a metaphor holds the power to shape public perception. For example, in the metaphor "fighting the pandemic is a war," the government positions itself as the leader of the war, thereby reinforcing its authority and legitimacy. This use of metaphor not only shapes public understanding of the pandemic but also militarizes the issue, justifying the government's tough measures.</p>
            
            <h4>3. A Critical Perspective: Metaphor as a Tool for Ideological Operation</h4>
            <p>From a critical perspective, metaphor is not just a tool for expressing meaning but also for constructing reality. By simplifying complex social phenomena into easily understandable images, metaphor plays a significant role in ideological operations. It naturalizes certain positions, obscures real contradictions, and thereby maintains existing power structures. For example, the metaphor "the economy needs rebuilding" likens economic issues to construction problems, obscuring the social contradictions and inequalities behind economic issues and thus preserving the existing economic order.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The multifaceted functions and profound impact of metaphor in modern society are evident not only in technological cognition, social emotion shaping, and political ideology but also in its importance as a cognitive and ideological tool. Through metaphor, we can better understand and construct complex technological systems, convey and resonate with social emotions, and shape and guide public perception. However, the use of metaphor must be approached with caution to avoid potential misguidance and distortion. In future research and practice, how to better harness the power of metaphor while avoiding its limitations will become an important topic.</p>
