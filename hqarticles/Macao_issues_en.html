            <h2>Macau: The Complexity of Cultural Interchange and Economic Development</h2>
            <p>Macau, a small city at the southern tip of China, is both the Las Vegas of the East and a unique landmark of East-West cultural exchange. Its history, culture, and economic development dimensions showcase the complexity and uniqueness of Macau.</p>

            <h3>I. The Fusion of History and Culture</h3>
            <p>The cultural richness of Macau stems from its long history. As a Portuguese colony for over 400 years, Macau has served as a vital bridge for East-West cultural exchanges. Portuguese architecture, squares, and Chinese traditional temples and rituals coexist harmoniously here. The handover of Macau marked a significant victory for China in terms of sovereignty, yet it retained its unique cultural identity. The Basic Law ensures Macau's cultural diversity, allowing it to continue showcasing its unique cultural charm under the "One Country, Two Systems" policy.</p>

            <p>Macau's economic diversity is due to its geographical location and historical legacy. The gambling industry is the backbone of Macau's economy, accounting for a significant portion of its GDP. However, Macau is not just a gambling city. With the SAR government's policy of economic diversification, tourism, conventions, financial services, and cultural industries are also developing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gambling Industry:</strong> The prosperity of Macau's gambling began in the mid-19th century post the Opium Wars, evolving from a monopoly to an open competitive market. Today, Macau is one of the largest gambling markets globally.</li>
