            <h2>Reconstruction of Film Rights in the Context of Digitalization and Globalization</h2>
            <p>In today's era of digitalization and globalization, film rights face unprecedented challenges and opportunities. Technological advancements and cultural integration have profoundly changed how films are produced, distributed, and consumed. This article will explore the reconstruction of film rights from three perspectives: digital technology and streaming, globalization and cross-cultural dissemination, and the application of AI in film production.</p>

            <h3>Copyright Protection and User Experience in the Era of Digitalization and Streaming</h3>
            <h4>Digital Technology and Copyright Challenges</h4>
            <p>The widespread use of the internet has made illegal copying and distribution of films extremely easy, posing significant challenges for copyright holders in protecting their works in an open environment. Technologies like Digital Rights Management (DRM) have emerged, but they also raise debates about user freedom and experience. DRM might restrict users from playing content across different devices, or even accessing content if the platform shuts down. Therefore, a delicate balance must be found between copyright protection and user experience.</p>
            <h4>Technological Innovation and User Education</h4>
            <p>To better protect copyrights without sacrificing user experience, the film industry is adopting more advanced technologies like blockchain for transaction records, and watermarking for tracing sources. Simultaneously, educating consumers about the importance of copyright protection helps reduce illegal downloads and distribution.</p>

            <h3>Globalization and Legal and Collaborative Aspects of Cross-Cultural Film Rights</h3>
            <h4>Differences in Copyright Laws Across Countries</h4>
            <p>Globalization allows films to transcend borders, but significant differences exist in copyright laws of various countries. For example, Chinese copyright laws differ markedly from those in the U.S. regarding protection periods and review systems, impacting global distribution and revenue sharing. Protecting film copyrights within different legal frameworks has become a key issue in international cooperation.</p>
            <h4>Copyright Attribution in International Collaborations</h4>
            <p>In cross-cultural projects, copyright ownership and profit distribution need to be clearly stipulated in contracts. International collaborations must consider not only legal frameworks but also respect and understand different cultural backgrounds, adapting copyright strategies to meet the needs of various markets.</p>
            <h4>Dispute Resolution Mechanisms</h4>
            <p>When copyright disputes arise, mechanisms like international arbitration, international courts, or bilateral agreements become crucial. These mechanisms help resolve cross-border copyright disputes, reducing litigation costs and time.</p>

            <h3>Challenges in Film Rights Due to AI in Production</h3>
            <h4>Copyright Ownership of AI-Generated Content</h4>
            <p>The use of AI in film production, from scriptwriting to special effects creation, challenges traditional copyright frameworks. As AI is a non-human entity, the copyright of its creations is ambiguous. Current legal frameworks focus more on human creators, thus defining AI's "creative process" and providing legal protection is an urgent issue to address.</p>
            <h4>Integration of AI with Traditional Creative Processes</h4>
            <p>AI is not just a tool but can also act as a creator, editor, or producer. This changes every aspect of film production and raises new questions regarding copyright distribution and protection. Future legal provisions might be needed to handle situations where AI participates in creation, such as copyright registration and protection terms.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Under the multifaceted influence of digitalization, globalization, and AI, the reconstruction of film rights has become an unavoidable topic in the film industry. Future development requires finding a balance in technological innovation, legal adjustments, and international cooperation. Copyright protection must not only secure the interests of creators but also promote cultural exchange, protect user experience, and drive technological advancement. Through comprehensive legal frameworks, more transparent profit distribution mechanisms, and new forms of collaboration, the film industry can achieve sustainable development in a new technological environment, fostering further prosperity in the creative sector. The ultimate goal is to ensure that creators can continue to produce, consumers can enjoy quality content, and the industry thrives in the era of globalization and digitalization.</p>
