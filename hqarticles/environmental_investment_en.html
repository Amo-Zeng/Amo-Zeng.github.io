            <h2>Environmental Investment and Corporate ESG Competitiveness: Value Reconstruction and Emerging Market Opportunities in the Digital Age</h2>
            <p>Against the backdrop of increasingly severe global environmental issues, environmental investment has evolved from a tool for enterprises to passively comply with regulations into a strategic choice for enhancing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) competitiveness and driving sustainable development. Meanwhile, digital transformation is profoundly changing business models, and emerging markets are offering enterprises vast development opportunities. The integration of environmental investment, digital transformation, and emerging markets not only reshapes corporate value but also injects new vitality into the sustainable development of the global economy.</p>
