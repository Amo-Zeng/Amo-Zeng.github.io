            <h2>The Multidimensional Artistic Expression of Translation</h2>
            <p>Translation is a bridge that spans languages and cultures, and dramatic translation, as a shining gem in the field of translation, not only bears the mission of language conversion but also shoulders the multiple responsibilities of cultural heritage, emotional resonance, and artistic recreation. This article will delve into the multidimensional artistic expression of translation in the theater field from the perspectives of theater experience, dramatic performance levels, and cultural reception, and explore how to find a balance point in seemingly opposing translation strategies to achieve the true value of translation.</p>

            <h3>1. Theater Experience: How Translation Shapes Audience Interaction and Cultural Resonance</h3>
            <p>Dramatic translation is far from a simple word-for-word conversion but a process of cultural transmission and reshaping. In this process, translators must not only accurately grasp the content of the script but also deeply understand the audience's theater experience. For example, the traditional Chinese translation of "intermission" as "幕间休息" (curtain break) emphasizes the structural chapters of the drama, carrying a strong professional dramatic color. However, in recent years, "中场休息" (half-time break) has gradually gained popularity, which is closer to the audience's daily language, implying the continuity and interactivity of the theater experience, becoming a period for the audience to adjust emotions and socialize.</p>

            <h3>2. Dramatic Performance Levels: The Art of Conveying Subtext and Implied Meanings</h3>
            <p>The art of dramatic translation lies in how to fully transplant the subtext or implied meanings of the script into the target language. Subtext is the soul of dramatic performance, like an undercurrent beneath the surface, appearing calm but actually containing immense emotional energy. During the performance, actors transmit the emotional information behind the lines to the audience through expressions, actions, tones, and other non-verbal symbols. This information transmission often transcends the boundaries of language, reaching deep into the audience's hearts.</p>

            <h3>3. Cultural Reception Perspective: The Balancing Art of Localization and Alienation</h3>
            <p>When crossing the linguistic barrier, translators face an eternal dilemma: whether to "localize" the original text to align with the target audience's cultural cognition or to "alienate" it, retaining the cultural characteristics of the original text. This dilemma is not a simple either-or choice but requires finding a balance point between localization and alienation to achieve the true artistic essence of translation.</p>

            <h3>4. The Multidimensional Mission of Translation: A Spiritual Bond Connecting Human Civilizations</h3>
            <p>Translation is not just a conversion of language but a dialogue of cultures. In this globalized era, translation should serve as a bridge, neither blindly following foreign cultures nor clinging to the barriers of local culture. By skillfully balancing "localization" and "alienation," we can enable different civilizations to understand and develop together through dialogue, making translation a witness and inheritor of human civilization.</p>
