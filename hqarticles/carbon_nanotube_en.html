            <h2>Applications and Prospects of Carbon Nanotubes in Biomedicine and Nanomedicine Delivery</h2>
            <p>Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as a nanomaterial with unique physical and chemical properties, have attracted widespread attention in the biomedical field in recent years. Particularly, their potential in nanomedicine delivery systems offers new possibilities for modern medicine.</p>

            <h3>Targeted Drug Delivery</h3>
            <p>The unique structure of carbon nanotubes, such as their high aspect ratio and tubular shape, makes them ideal drug carriers. Through surface functionalization techniques, researchers can attach specific ligands or drug molecules to the surface of carbon nanotubes to achieve targeted drug delivery. This not only increases the bioavailability of the drug but also significantly reduces side effects. For example, in cancer treatment, carbon nanotubes can be designed to target cancer cells, releasing drugs to enhance therapeutic efficacy while minimizing damage to healthy cells.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Targeting:</strong> Carbon nanotubes can be modified on their surface to carry specific antibodies or ligands, enabling precise recognition and binding to specific cell types, like cancer cells. This enhances local drug concentration and reduces systemic toxicity.</li>
                <li><strong>Controlled Release:</strong> Using the structural properties of carbon nanotubes, drug release systems can be designed with pH or thermal sensitivity. For instance, drugs can be triggered to release under the acidic conditions of the tumor microenvironment, achieving precise strikes against tumors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Biosensors</h3>
            <p>The high surface area and excellent electrical conductivity of carbon nanotubes make them highly potential in the field of biosensors. By integrating carbon nanotubes into wearable or implantable sensors, real-time monitoring of biomarkers can be achieved.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-time Monitoring:</strong> Carbon nanotubes can be used to manufacture highly sensitive biosensors for monitoring physiological parameters such as blood sugar, blood pressure, heart rate, and detecting disease-related biomarkers like those for cancer or diabetes. This real-time monitoring not only improves the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis but also supports personalized medicine and health management with data.</li>
                <li><strong>Multifunctionality:</strong> Carbon nanotubes can be combined with other nanomaterials (like quantum dots, gold nanoparticles) to form multifunctional composite sensors, providing more comprehensive biological information.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Challenges and Prospects</h3>
            <p>While the prospects of carbon nanotubes in biomedicine and nanomedicine delivery are vast, several challenges remain:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biocompatibility:</strong> Biocompatibility is a critical issue. Studies have shown that carbon nanotubes might cause cytotoxicity or immune responses. Hence, developing biocompatible carbon nanotubes and their derivatives is an urgent task.</li>
                <li><strong>Degradability:</strong> Ensuring that carbon nanotubes can be safely degraded or excreted from the body is also a significant challenge. Researchers are currently exploring chemical modifications to enhance their biodegradability.</li>
                <li><strong>Production and Quality Control:</strong> Large-scale production of high-quality carbon nanotubes, ensuring their purity, size, and consistency in functionalization, is key to their clinical application.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulation and Ethics:</strong> The clinical application of carbon nanotubes also faces strict regulatory and ethical scrutiny to ensure safety and effectiveness.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In summary, the application of carbon nanotubes in biomedicine and nanomedicine delivery holds broad prospects. As research continues to deepen and technology advances, carbon nanotubes are poised to play a larger role in the medical field, providing new tools and methods for disease diagnosis and treatment. Future interdisciplinary collaboration will be a crucial driver for progress in this field, with biologists, chemists, materials scientists, and clinicians needing to work together to overcome existing challenges and achieve comprehensive application of carbon nanotubes in medicine.</p>
