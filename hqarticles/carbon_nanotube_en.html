                <li><strong>Removal of Heavy Metal Ions</strong>: Through electrostatic interactions and coordination bonds, carbon nanotubes can efficiently adsorb heavy metal ions such as lead, cadmium, and mercury. For example, carboxyl-functionalized carbon nanotubes can achieve an adsorption efficiency of 50 mg/g for lead ions.</li>
                <li><strong>Removal of Organic Pollutants</strong>: Carbon nanotubes adsorb organic pollutants like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, and dyes through π-π interactions and van der Waals forces. For instance, hydroxyl-functionalized carbon nanotubes exhibit efficient adsorption capability for methylene blue dye.</li>
                <li><strong>Removal of Microplastics</strong>: Carbon nanotubes can adsorb microplastic particles like polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) through electrostatic interactions, reducing their dispersion in water bodies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, the environmental application of carbon nanotubes still faces challenges in safety and sustainability, such as avoiding secondary pollution and achieving recycling. These issues require surface modification and stabilization technologies to be addressed.</p>
