            <h2>Properties and Wide Applications of Carbon Nanotubes</h2>
            <p>Carbon nanotubes are nanoscale tubular structures composed of carbon atoms, characterized by their exceptional strength and toughness, as well as excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. These properties make carbon nanotubes promising for a wide range of applications. By embedding carbon nanotubes into various materials, products with multiple intelligent functions can be created, such as smart textiles, efficient energy storage devices, and biomedical tools.</p>

            <h3>Applications in Smart Textiles</h3>
            <p>In the field of smart textiles, the application of carbon nanotubes stands out. By embedding carbon nanotubes into textile fibers, clothing with multiple intelligent functions can be produced, such as health monitoring and temperature regulation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Health Monitoring:</strong> Carbon nanotubes can be integrated into clothing fibers to develop smart garments that monitor the wearer's health. These smart garments can continuously monitor vital signs such as heart rate, body temperature, and breathing rate, and transmit the data to smartphones or medical devices via wireless technology. This is particularly significant for patients with chronic diseases, the elderly, and athletes. Doctors can use this data to monitor the patient's health status in real-time, provide remote diagnoses, and offer treatment recommendations.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Adaptability:</strong> Carbon nanotubes can also be used to develop smart jackets that automatically adjust their insulation properties based on environmental temperature. By embedding carbon nanotubes into textiles, a sensitive response to temperature changes can be achieved. When the environmental temperature drops, carbon nanotubes can increase the contact between fibers, enhancing insulation; when the temperature rises, carbon nanotubes can reduce the contact between fibers, increasing breathability, thus maintaining the wearer's comfort. This smart jacket not only improves the wearing experience but also provides better protection in extreme weather conditions.</li>
