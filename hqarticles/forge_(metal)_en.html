            <h3>Casting Iron with Soul: Cross-disciplinary Fusion of Forge Art</h3>
            <p>Forging is not only an essential part of industrial manufacturing but also increasingly becoming a medium of artistic expression. In the context of contemporary art, forge art has transcended its original functional role, becoming a carrier of cultural spirit. By reconstructing the material properties of metal, forging has transformed from functionality to artistic quality, showcasing unique artistic charm in cross-disciplinary applications such as architecture, sculpture, and furniture design.</p>
            <p>The cross-disciplinary aspect of forge art first involves a fundamental transformation in material properties. Traditional forging techniques shape metal into functional industrial products, while contemporary artists view forging as an artistic means to reinterpret material essence. By precisely controlling processes like heating, hammering, and folding, metal ceases to be a cold material and becomes a living, growing, evolving entity. This activation of material allows forge art to participate in contemporary artistic dialogue.</p>
            <p>In the field of architecture, forge art demonstrates unique spatial narrative abilities. Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava perfectly combines forging with structural aesthetics, creating architectural forms that balance mechanics and beauty. In his works, forging is no longer just a means of structural support but becomes the poetic source of architectural space. Through precise forging, metal gains unprecedented expressive power, serving as a bridge connecting nature and humanity, tradition and modernity.</p>
            <p>In furniture design, forge art reflects deep thinking about the quality of life. Designers use the exquisite performance of forging to transform functional furniture into sculptural art pieces. British designer Matthew Valentine Salt's work blends traditional forging techniques with modern design concepts, creating furniture series that are both functional and artistically valuable. Metal in his hands is no longer merely a supporting framework but becomes an emotional carrier that tells stories.</p>
            <p>The cross-disciplinary practice of forge art essentially achieves a high degree of unification in craft, art, and technology. It proves that artisan spirit and artistic creativity can blend perfectly, showcasing new possibilities for artistic innovation.
