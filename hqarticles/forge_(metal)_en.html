            <h3>The Evolution of Forging Technology and Its Social Impact</h3>
            <p><strong>Stone Age: The Dawn of Beginnings</strong></p>
            <p>The Stone Age marked the infancy of forging technology. Early humans, by knapping stones, initially grasped the basic principles of metal processing. Although stone tool production during this period was relatively simple, it laid the foundation for human tool-making, promoted the efficiency of hunting and gathering activities, and thus drove the emergence of early social divisions of labor.</p>
            <p><strong>Bronze Age: A Catalyst for Social Differentiation</strong></p>
            <p>The advent of the Bronze Age signaled a new stage in forging technology. The widespread use of bronze tools not only improved the performance of tools and weapons but also promoted the development of agriculture and handicraft industries. The production of bronze required complex smelting and forging techniques, leading to the emergence of specialized blacksmiths, and further refining social divisions of labor. At the same time, the scarcity and high value of bronze artifacts promoted the formation of trade networks, making exchanges and resource complementation between different regions possible.</p>
            <p><strong>Iron Age: An Accelerator of Social Change</strong></p>
            <p>The arrival of the Iron Age profoundly transformed human society. Iron was more durable and easier to work with than bronze, widely used in agricultural tools, weapons, and daily utensils. The proliferation of iron farm tools significantly enhanced agricultural productivity, providing a material foundation for population growth and urbanization. Simultaneously, the superior performance of iron weapons changed the nature of warfare, promoting the formation of early empires and city-states. The large-scale production of iron tools demanded more refined divisions of labor and cooperation, elevating the status of blacksmiths as important societal roles.</p>

            <h3>The Spread of Forging Technology and the Evolution of Blacksmithing Professions</h3>
            <p><strong>Spread Pathways of Forging Technology</strong></p>
            <p>The spread of forging technology was not isolated but diffused across different civilizations through trade, war, and migration. For instance, forging techniques from ancient Mesopotamia spread through trade routes to ancient Egypt and ancient India, promoting the development of bronze civilizations in these regions. Iron technology spread from the Middle East to the Mediterranean coast, North Africa, and Europe, eventually forming a broad iron culture circle.</p>
            <p><strong>Evolution of Blacksmithing Professions</strong></p>
            <p>Ancient blacksmiths were not only keepers of technology but also intellectual elites in society. They possessed core technologies in smelting, forging, and metal processing, enjoying high social status. As social divisions of labor became more refined, blacksmiths gradually specialized into different fields, such as weapon blacksmiths, agricultural tool blacksmiths, and decorative artisans. However, with the advent of the Industrial Revolution, the professional roles of traditional blacksmiths underwent profound changes. Modern industrial blacksmiths are no longer independent artisans but technical operators on industrial assembly lines, with forging technology increasingly relying on automation and mechanization.</p>

            <h3>The Artistry and Spiritual Symbolism of Forging</h3>
            <p><strong>Sacred Forging in Religion and Mythology</strong></p>
            <p>In Norse mythology, the dwarf blacksmith Thor is depicted as a craftsman capable of forging unparalleled weapons and treasures. Thor's works are not only material but also symbols of power, embodying the balance of power between gods, between gods and humans. Thor's hammer—Mjölnir—is not only a tool of power but also a symbol of justice and order. Through Thor's forging, we see a mythological universe of creation and destruction, order and chaos.</p>
            <p>In Greek mythology, Hephaestus, as the god of fire and forging, his workshop is the center of creation, the origin of civilization. Hephaestus's forging is not merely functional; each of his works is imbued with sacred meaning. His forging is a process of purification and elevation, transforming ordinary metals into symbols of divinity through the baptism of fire. Here, forging is not just shaping matter but purifying the soul.</p>
            <p><strong>Forging in Art and Culture</strong></p>
            <p>In Japan, sword forging is considered a highly refined art form. Swordsmiths pursue not only the sharpness and durability of swords but also their aesthetic and spiritual perfection. The aesthetics of Japanese swords, such as the curvature of the blade and the delicacy of the patterns, are concrete manifestations of artisanal spirit. Swords are not just weapons but symbols of samurai spirit, embodying harmony between the warrior, nature, and the universe.</p>
            <p>In China, the casting of ancient bronzeware was a highly complex craft, not just a display of technology but also a symbol of social hierarchy and power structures. The decorations and inscriptions on bronzeware record ancient Chinese history, myths, and religious beliefs. The casting process of bronzeware was a fusion of craftsmen's wisdom and religious faith, each casting being a sacrifice to the gods and a confirmation of the royal authority.</p>
            <p><strong>Forging and Cultural Revival</strong></p>
            <p>In modern society, traditional forging crafts are being rediscovered and applied in cultural products to enhance national pride. In Europe, medieval forging techniques are being re-used to produce replicas and artworks, recreating the glory of history. In the United States, Native American forging techniques are used in modern art to promote national culture and history.</p>
            <p>The role of forging in national identity and cultural revival is not only about the传承 of crafts but also about the transmission of spirit. Through forging, a nation's history, culture, and beliefs are materialized, given new life. The process of forging, like the forging of a national spirit, every hammer blow, every quenching, is a test and elevation of the national spirit.</p>
