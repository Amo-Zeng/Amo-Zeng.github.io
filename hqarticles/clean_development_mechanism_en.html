            <h2>Rethinking the Clean Development Mechanism</h2>
            <p>The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), as a core mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol framework, aims to promote global greenhouse gas emission reductions and sustainable development in developing countries through technological innovation and financial support. However, despite playing a significant role in global climate governance, CDM’s practice has exposed profound technical limitations, conflicts of interest, and social injustice issues. This article will re-examine the effectiveness and challenges of CDM from three dimensions: technological innovation, global governance, and social justice, exploring pathways for its future transformation.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>The Double-Edged Sword of Technological Innovation: From "Replication" to "Localization"</h3>
            <p>Technological innovation is the core driving force for CDM to promote emission reductions, but its practice has shown a clear tendency towards "replication." Mature technologies from developed countries, such as renewable energy, energy efficiency improvements, and carbon capture and storage (CCS), are directly introduced into developing countries without adaptability improvements for local conditions. This "technology replication" model has achieved emission reduction targets in the short term but failed to truly enhance the technological innovation capabilities of developing countries. Moreover, technological innovation faces numerous challenges in localized applications. For example, in underdeveloped areas, weak grid infrastructure significantly undermines the effectiveness of clean energy technologies; the lack of localized technical support and training also makes it difficult for innovation results to transform into sustainable development drivers.</p>
            <p>However, the potential of technological innovation has not been fully tapped. If CDM strengthens localized improvements and innovations, such as developing distributed energy systems suitable for remote areas or providing technical training for local residents, it could genuinely enhance the technological capabilities of developing countries. This "technology transfer" rather than "technology replication" model will align more closely with CDM’s original intent—to promote global sustainable development through technological innovation.</p>

            <h3>Imbalance in Global Governance: From "Win-Win" to "Transformation"</h3>
            <p>The original design of CDM aimed to achieve a "win-win" situation by enabling developed countries to invest in emission reduction projects in developing countries: developed countries fulfill their emission reduction commitments at a lower cost, while developing countries receive financial and technological support. However, CDM’s geographical distribution is highly unbalanced, with projects mainly concentrated in a few developing countries like China and India, while regions most in need of support, such as Africa, are almost excluded. This imbalance exacerbates the North-South divide in global climate governance, significantly diminishing CDM’s actual effectiveness.</p>
            <p>With the signing of the Paris Agreement, global climate governance has entered a new phase, emphasizing "nationally determined contributions" (NDCs) and "global temperature rise control targets." CDM’s traditional model cannot fully adapt to this new framework, especially in terms of transparency, environmental integrity, and long-term emission reduction goals. Therefore, CDM needs to reposition itself to better support the implementation of the Paris Agreement. This means CDM must evolve from being just an emission trading tool to becoming a platform that promotes global cooperation and development. For instance, by introducing new funding mechanisms to ensure resources flow to the most needy regions and countries; by strengthening international cooperation to promote fair technology transfer and sharing.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Challenges to Social Justice: From "Green Exploitation" to "Global Justice"</h3>
            <p>In the implementation of CDM, issues of environmental rights deprivation and social justice have become increasingly apparent. Many CDM projects, such as large hydroelectric dams and wind farms, have sacrificed the land rights of local communities, pushing residents deeper into poverty. Moreover, CDM projects’ considerations for ecological protection often remain superficial, leading to biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. More seriously, the "green jobs" created by CDM projects are often low-skill, low-wage, and fail to fundamentally improve the livelihoods of local communities; while high-value-added sectors, such as technology research and development and carbon credit trading, are firmly controlled by developed countries, with developing countries trapped at the bottom of the "green supply chain."</p>
            <p>This "green exploitation" model not only fails to address global climate change issues but also exacerbates the North-South gap and environmental injustice. To achieve true global environmental justice, CDM mechanisms need to be re-examined to ensure they truly benefit developing countries and safeguard local communities’ environmental rights and social justice. For example, by strengthening project supervision to ensure local community participation in decision-making; by establishing a fairer carbon emission trading mechanism to balance global environmental and development interests.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: CDM’s Transformation and Future</h3>
            <p>As an important tool in global climate governance, CDM faces profound challenges in technological innovation, global governance, and social justice. To truly achieve its goal of promoting sustainable development, CDM needs comprehensive transformation: from "technology replication" to "technology localization," from "win-win transactions" to "global cooperation," from "green exploitation" to "global justice." Only by constructing a fairer, more inclusive, and innovative CDM framework can we truly address the challenges of global climate change and realize the vision of global sustainable development.</p>
