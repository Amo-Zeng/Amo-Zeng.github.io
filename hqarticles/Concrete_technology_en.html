            <h3>Self-healing Functionality: The Self-evolution of Concrete</h3>
            <p>The self-healing capability of concrete materials is another important manifestation of its "soft power." By introducing technologies such as microorganisms and nanomaterials, concrete can automatically repair itself after damage, extending the lifespan of buildings and reducing resource waste.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microbial Self-healing Concrete: The Combination of Environmental Protection and Efficiency</strong>
                    <p>Microbial self-healing concrete utilizes specific types of bacteria that release calcium ions when cracks appear in the concrete, generating calcium carbonate to fill the cracks and achieving self-repair. This technology is not only environmentally friendly but also significantly improves the durability of concrete, reducing maintenance costs. For example, in environments prone to erosion such as ports and bridges, microbial self-healing concrete can effectively resist saltwater erosion, extending the service life of structures. The application of this technology not only lowers building maintenance costs but also provides more reliable solutions for marine engineering and infrastructure construction.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Nano Self-healing Concrete: A Miracle in the Micro World</strong>
                    <p>Nano self-healing concrete adds nanoparticles that form a microscopic network structure within the concrete. When damage occurs, these nanoparticles can automatically migrate to the damaged area, fill the cracks, and enhance the material's strength. This technology not only repairs tiny cracks but also improves the overall performance of concrete, providing more reliable protection for high-strength building structures. The introduction of nanotechnology not only enhances the performance of concrete but also opens up new research directions in microscopic material design.</p>

                <li><strong>3D Printing Construction: The Digital Future of Concrete</strong>
                    <p>The application of 3D printing technology in the construction field is no longer a plot in science fiction novels. By optimizing concrete formulations, 3D printing construction can achieve faster, more precise, and diverse building processes. The core of this technology lies in combining concrete materials with digital manufacturing, making complex architectural forms and structures possible. For example, 3D printing technology can be used to manufacture complex curved architectural components, or even achieve rapid construction of entire buildings. This technology not only greatly shortens the construction period but also provides more flexibility in architectural design and construction.</p>
                </li>

            <h3>Learning from Nature: Creating a "Green" Path for Concrete</h3>
            <p>The production and use of concrete have a significant environmental impact, but through the introduction of biomimetic design and zero-carbon emission technologies, the concrete industry is undergoing a green revolution. Learning from nature not only provides new inspiration for concrete materials but also opens up new paths to achieve sustainable development goals.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biomimetic Design Inspiration: Nature's Alternative to Concrete</strong>
                    <p>Nature is a treasure trove of material science, with many organisms achieving lightweight, high-strength, and self-healing functions through ingenious structural design. For example, the layered structure of mollusk shells, achieved by alternately stacking proteins and calcium carbonate, endows them with extremely high compressive strength and stability. Researchers have drawn inspiration from this design to develop layered composite concrete materials, significantly improving the crack resistance and impact resistance of concrete by adding fiber-reinforced materials. Additionally, the anchoring mechanism of plant roots has inspired researchers to develop "root-like concrete," which adds biodegradable fibers to form a network structure similar to plant roots, enhancing its tensile strength and impermeability. This biomimetic design not only improves the performance of concrete but also provides new ideas for the development of eco-friendly building materials.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>The Goal of Zero Carbon Emissions: Application of Industrial Waste and Carbon Capture Technologies</strong>
                    <p>The carbon emissions in the production of concrete mainly come from cement manufacturing, which is one of the major sources of global carbon dioxide emissions. To achieve the goal of zero carbon emissions, the reuse of industrial waste and the introduction of carbon capture technologies are key. For example, industrial waste such as fly ash and slag can replace part of the cement, reducing carbon emissions and improving the performance of concrete. Additionally, carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies combine captured carbon dioxide with concrete materials to generate calcium carbonate, not only reducing carbon emissions but also enhancing the strength and durability of concrete. The application of this technology not only lowers the carbon footprint of concrete but also provides important support for achieving the "dual carbon" goals.</p>
