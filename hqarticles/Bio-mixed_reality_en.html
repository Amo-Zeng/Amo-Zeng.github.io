            <p>Under the dome of the International Architecture Biennale in CÃ¡ceres, Spain, a cluster of slime molds is weaving a map of cognitive revolution with golden mycelium. This wood-born living system reconstructed Tokyo's metro network in just 40 hours, creating a topology that not only achieves 23% higher energy efficiency than human-designed solutions but also autonomously developed a stress-dispersal mechanism against magnitude 6 earthquakes within three days.</p>
