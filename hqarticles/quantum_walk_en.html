            <h3>Basic Concepts of Quantum Walks</h3>
            <p>Quantum walks can be seen as the quantum mechanical version of classical random walks, where particles can exist in a superposition of multiple locations, following the rules of quantum interference and entanglement. This leads to quantum walks having faster diffusion rates and different probability distribution characteristics compared to classical random walks. Quantum walks are primarily divided into Continuous-Time Quantum Walks (CTQW) and Discrete-Time Quantum Walks (DTQWs), suitable for different application scenarios.</p>
