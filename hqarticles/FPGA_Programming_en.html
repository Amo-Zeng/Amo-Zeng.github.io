            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In modern computing environments, performance optimization and energy efficiency are always core concerns. With the explosion of data volumes and computational demands, traditional CPUs and GPUs are increasingly showing their limitations in certain applications. FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) as a flexible hardware solution provides new optimization ideas. This article will explore how FPGA programming shifts from software to hardware thinking and look forward to the significant role of FPGA in future computational architectures.</p>

            <h2>FPGA and Hardware Acceleration</h2>
            <p>Unlike the fixed-function ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit), FPGA can dynamically change its hardware configuration according to the needs, meaning it can be configured to act as a hardware accelerator for specific tasks. The core of hardware acceleration lies in transferring compute-intensive or time-sensitive tasks from general-purpose processors to specifically designed hardware, thereby enhancing execution speed and efficiency.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantages of Hardware Acceleration:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Parallel Processing</strong>: FPGA can execute multiple operations simultaneously, significantly boosting computation speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Latency</strong>: Hardware directly manipulates data, avoiding overhead from operating systems or software layers.</li>
                <li><strong>Customization</strong>: Hardware structure can be optimized for specific algorithms, reducing unnecessary operations.</li>
            </ul>
