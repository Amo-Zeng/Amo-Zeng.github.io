            <h2>The Dual Nature of Commentary: Confirmation of Existence and Dissolution of Meaning</h2>
            <p>Commentary is first and foremost a confirmation of existence. When we issue a commentary, it means we have perceived, thought about, and judged a certain object. This act itself is a confirmation of our own existence, a response to the world. However, commentary is also a dissolution of meaning.</p>

            <h2>Philosophical Transcendence of Commentary: From Speech to Understanding</h2>
