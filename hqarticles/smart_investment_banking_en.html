            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In today's rapidly evolving financial technology landscape, AI advisory has become a pivotal tool for individual investors in financial planning. However, traditional AI advisory services often base asset allocation solely on users' risk preferences and financial goals, which somewhat limits the depth and breadth of their services. To overcome these limitations, the AI advisory industry is exploring a series of innovative solutions, closely integrating technology, emotion, and social responsibility, pushing AI advisory into a new phase of development.</p>

            <h3>Personalized Risk Management Model: Integrating Precision and Dynamism in Technology</h3>
            <p>The introduction of a personalized risk management model signifies a deepening and evolution of AI advisory services. Through **deep learning** and **big data analytics**, the system can incorporate users' multidimensional life data into the risk assessment framework. This includes not only traditional financial data like income, expenditure, assets, and liabilities but also extends to non-traditional data such as lifestyle habits, consumption behavior, and job stability:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lifestyle Analysis</strong>: The system can analyze daily consumption behavior, shopping preferences, and health status to assess the stability of a user's lifestyle and potential financial risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Job Stability Assessment</strong>: By analyzing a user's work history, industry trends, and employment market conditions, it predicts how job risks might impact finances.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A dynamic adjustment mechanism allows the AI advisory system to update risk models and investment portfolios in real-time as users' life circumstances change. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Job Change</strong>: When a user faces a job change, the system adjusts the investment portfolio based on the new job's stability and compensation, reducing the proportion of high-risk assets.</li>
                <li><strong>Family Structure Changes</strong>: Major life events like childbirth, marriage, or divorce affect a user's financial situation, prompting the system to adjust investment strategies accordingly to ensure financial security.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>By integrating technology, emotion, and social responsibility, AI advisory can provide not only more efficient and personalized financial planning services but also play a positive role in global sustainable development. In the future, as financial technology continues to evolve, AI advisory will become a significant force in promoting both individual and societal progress.</p>
