            <h2>Building a Healthy, Safe, and Sustainable Digital Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of technologies such as the Internet, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, digital ecosystems have become a crucial part of modern society. However, the development of these ecosystems also brings numerous challenges, including psychological safety issues, cybersecurity threats, and the overall security of the ecosystem. This article will explore how to build a healthy, safe, and sustainable digital ecosystem from three perspectives: psychological safety and cyber behavior, interdisciplinary cybersecurity education, and secure ecosystem design.</p>

            <h3>1. Psychological Safety and Cyber Behavior: The Foundation for a Healthy Online Environment</h3>
            <h4>1.1 Concept of Psychological Safety</h4>
            <p>Psychological safety refers to the mental state where an individual feels safe, respected, and accepted in a specific environment. In the online environment, psychological safety is particularly important because the anonymity and virtual nature of cyberspace can make individuals more vulnerable to harm, such as cyberbullying, information leaks, and online scams. A lack of psychological safety in the online environment not only affects an individual's emotions and mental health but can also lead to a decline in social trust and impact social harmony and stability.</p>
            <h4>1.2 Perspectives from Cyber Behavior</h4>
            <p>Cyber behavior is the study of individual behavior patterns, psychological motivations, and social interactions in the online environment. From the perspective of cyber behavior, individual online behavior is influenced by various factors, including personal traits, social environment, and technological conditions. Understanding how these factors influence individual online behavior is crucial for building a healthy online environment.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Traits:</strong> An individual's personality, values, and emotional state can affect their behavior online. For example, individuals with low self-esteem may be more likely to become victims or perpetrators of cyberbullying.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Environment:</strong> The social environment, including family, school, and workplace, significantly influences an individual's online behavior. A supportive and inclusive social environment can enhance an individual's psychological safety and reduce the occurrence of negative online behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Conditions:</strong> The design, features, and rules of online platforms also impact individual online behavior. For example, some social platforms reduce cyberbullying and the spread of harmful information through measures such as real-name systems and reporting mechanisms.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.3 Strategies for Building a Healthy Online Environment</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Individual Psychological Resilience:</strong> Through education and training, individuals can improve their psychological resilience and better cope with challenges in the online environment. For example, schools can offer mental health courses to teach students how to identify and respond to cyberbullying.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimizing Online Platform Design:</strong> Online platforms should take measures to optimize user experience and reduce negative behavior. For example, by optimizing algorithms to reduce the spread of harmful information and implementing real-name systems and reporting mechanisms to enhance the safety of the online environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening Legal and Regulatory Frameworks:</strong> Governments should develop and improve relevant laws and regulations to protect the rights and interests of online users and combat cybercrime. For example, establishing legal provisions for cyberbullying and clarifying the responsibilities and obligations of online platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting the Development of Social Support Systems:</strong> Social support systems, including families, schools, and communities, should play a role in providing psychological support and assistance. For example, family members should monitor their children's online behavior and address issues promptly; schools should establish mental health counseling mechanisms to provide professional psychological support to students.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Interdisciplinary Cybersecurity Education: A New Path to Comprehensive Security Awareness</h3>
            <h4>2.1 The Necessity of Interdisciplinary Integration</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Addressing Complex Threats:</strong> Cybersecurity threats are becoming increasingly complex, involving not only technical aspects but also non-technical means such as social engineering and psychological manipulation. Interdisciplinary integration can help students understand threats from multiple angles and improve their ability to respond.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultivating Comprehensive Skills:</strong> Cybersecurity requires not only technical expertise but also good communication skills, legal awareness, and management skills. Interdisciplinary education can cultivate students' comprehensive abilities, making them more adept in their practical work.</li>
