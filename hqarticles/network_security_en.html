            <h2>Cybersecurity in the Digital Age: Challenges of Humanity, Virtuality, and Climate</h2>
            <p>In the current global digital wave, cybersecurity has transcended the realm of pure technology, becoming a multi-dimensional challenge that encompasses humanity, virtual worlds, and the real environment. Analyzing the "human vulnerabilities" behind cyberattacks from a psychological perspective, the identity dilemmas intertwined in the metaverse, and the profound impact of climate change on the cybersecurity ecosystemâ€”these issues together weave a complex tapestry of cybersecurity.</p>

            <h3>Human Vulnerabilities: The Deep-Seated Concerns of Cybersecurity</h3>
            <p>In the digital age, technological advancements have not fully curbed the threat of cyberattacks, instead revealing a deeper vulnerability: "human weaknesses." Psychological studies show that human cognitive biases, emotional manipulation, and social engineering loopholes often become the key to attackers breaking through defenses.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Biases</strong>: Humans often exhibit cognitive biases such as confirmation bias and availability heuristic in information processing. Attackers use meticulously designed phishing emails or fake websites to trick users into revealing sensitive information.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Manipulation</strong>: Emotions are a significant driver of human decision-making. Attackers manipulate user behavior by triggering fear, greed, sympathy, and other emotions.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Engineering</strong>: Attackers exploit human social psychology to deceive. By masquerading as trustworthy individuals or institutions, attackers gain users' trust and access sensitive information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Metaverse: The Interplay of Virtual and Real Security</h3>
            <p>The rise of the metaverse marks a further blurring of the boundaries between virtual and real. In this digital parallel world, cybersecurity issues have become more complex and three-dimensional. The dimensions, scale, and value of personal data have reached unprecedented levels.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identity Dilemma</strong>: Digital identity serves as both access to the metaverse and the core carrier of personal digital assets. Traditional identity authentication systems face challenges in the metaverse.</li>
