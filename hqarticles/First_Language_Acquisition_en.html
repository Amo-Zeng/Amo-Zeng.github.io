            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Language is the core tool for human communication. The process of acquiring it is not only a central issue in cognitive science and neuroscience but also a significant area in education, psychology, and AI research. Through interdisciplinary approaches, we can delve deeper into the complexity of First Language Acquisition (FLA) and explore how technology and artificial intelligence (AI) can optimize this process. This article aims to comprehensively discuss the roles of cognitive processes, neurobiological mechanisms, socio-cultural environments, and technology applications in first language acquisition, revealing the multidimensional factors influencing language learning.</p>

            <h3>I. Cognitive Processes and Language Acquisition</h3>
            <p>Cognitive science provides us with a framework for understanding language acquisition:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statistical Learning:</strong> Infants learn languages by identifying patterns and regularities in speech, which begins to function from birth. For example, infants can recognize the frequency of words and phonetic cues, thereby mastering the basic structure of language.</li>
                <li><strong>Imitation and Repetition:</strong> By mimicking adult speech patterns, children gradually grasp phonetics, intonation, and syntax. This is not only a fundamental method of language learning but also an essential part of socialization.</li>
                <li><strong>Semantic Guidance:</strong> As cognitive abilities develop, children understand the meaning of words and sentences, aiding them in predicting and comprehending language use, thus enhancing fluency and accuracy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Furthermore, the formation of concepts and vocabulary acquisition is a dynamic process where children enrich their conceptual repository through interaction with their environment, thereby promoting language comprehension and expression.</p>

            <h3>II. Neurobiological Mechanisms</h3>
            <p>Neuroscience uncovers the neural basis of language acquisition:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Neural Development:</strong> The left hemisphere of the brain, particularly Broca's and Wernicke's areas, plays a crucial role in language processing. These areas begin developing from infancy and specialize during language acquisition.</li>
                <li><strong>Neural Plasticity:</strong> The high plasticity of the child's brain allows them to master complex linguistic structures in a relatively short time. The formation and reinforcement of neural connections are the biological foundations of language acquisition.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Using technologies like EEG and fMRI, we can observe how different brain regions work together during language learning, with these patterns dynamically changing as language proficiency increases.</p>
