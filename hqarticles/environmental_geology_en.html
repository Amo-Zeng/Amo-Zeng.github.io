            <h3>Geological Foundations: A Solid Backbone for Urban Sustainability</h3>
            <p>Urban geology, as the science studying geological environments, resources, and hazards in the process of urban construction and development, provides scientific basis and support for urban planning, construction, and management. It is the cornerstone of urban sustainability, ensuring efficient operation in resource utilization, disaster prevention and control, and environmental governance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Optimizing Land Use and Resource Allocation</strong>  
                    Geological surveys reveal the carrying capacity, suitability, and potential risks of urban land, providing scientific basis for land use planning. For example, by analyzing groundwater distribution and soil types, the layout of industrial, residential, and ecological protection areas can be optimized, avoiding blind development that leads to resource waste and environmental damage. This scientific approach not only improves land use efficiency but also lays the foundation for urban sustainability.</li>
                <li><strong>Reducing Geological Disaster Risks</strong>  
                    Extreme weather events (such as heavy rains, droughts, and rising sea levels) significantly increase the risk of geological disasters. Urban geological research identifies potential disaster areas, assesses their risk levels, and develops targeted disaster prevention measures. For example, real-time monitoring of groundwater levels can provide early warnings for geological disasters like ground subsidence and landslides, securing valuable time for urban safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient Utilization of Geological Resources</strong>  
                    Urban geological research provides scientific guidance for resource development and utilization. For example, exploring underground spaces can alleviate ground traffic pressure and improve land use efficiency. Evaluating geothermal resources optimizes the energy structure, reduces carbon emissions, and promotes the green transition of cities.</li>

            <h3>Challenges of Climate Change: Geological Responses to Extreme Weather Events</h3>
            <p>Climate change is profoundly reshaping global geological environments, with extreme weather events (such as heavy rains, droughts, and rising sea levels) increasingly influencing geological processes. These events not only threaten ecosystem stability but also impact sustainable development by altering geological structures.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heavy Rains and Landslides, Debris Flows</strong>  
                    Frequent extreme rainfall events lead to rapid increases in soil saturation, raising the risk of landslides and debris flows. These geological hazards not only damage surface structures but also cause soil erosion and changes in river sediment patterns, affecting downstream ecosystem stability. By combining climate models with geological records, researchers can predict the frequency and intensity of these extreme events, providing scientific basis for urban planning and disaster prevention.</li>
                <li><strong>Droughts and Soil Erosion</strong>  
                    Drought events make soils fragile, reducing their resistance to wind erosion and causing land degradation and frequent dust storms. Prolonged droughts also lead to groundwater level declines, affecting geological stability and ecosystem health. Geological research can reveal the long-term impacts of drought events on soils and groundwater systems, providing scientific guidance for ecological restoration and resource management in drought-prone areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Rising Sea Levels and Coastal Erosion</strong>  
                    Rising sea levels intensify coastal erosion, causing shoreline retreat, wetland loss, and coastal ecosystem destruction. Additionally, saltwater intrusion into groundwater systems threatens agricultural production and human health. Geological research can assess the impacts of rising sea levels on coastal cities, developing scientific strategies to protect the integrity of coastal ecosystems.</li>

            <h3>Microbial Remediation: The "Invisible Engineers" of Geological Environmental Restoration</h3>
            <p>Facing geological environmental issues caused by climate change, microbial remediation technologies, as an efficient and eco-friendly solution, are gradually becoming a new paradigm in environmental governance. Microorganisms, through their unique metabolic activities, can effectively degrade pollutants, stabilize heavy metals, and improve soil quality.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heavy Metal Pollution Remediation</strong>  
                    Certain microorganisms can convert heavy metals from soluble ions into stable minerals through redox reactions, reducing their bio-toxicity. For example, sulfate-reducing and iron-reducing bacteria have shown great potential in soil remediation, providing new pathways for heavy metal-contaminated site management.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Pollutant Degradation</strong>  
                    Microorganisms can secrete specific enzymes to decompose complex organic pollutants into harmless substances (such as carbon dioxide and water), achieving complete pollutant degradation. For example, some bacteria can efficiently degrade pollutants from oil spills, providing a rapid and effective solution for environmental restoration.</li>
                <li><strong>Application of Genetic Engineering and Synthetic Biology</strong>  
                    Through gene editing and synthetic biology, researchers can modify microorganisms to enhance their ability to handle specific pollutants. For example, designing "super microorganisms" capable of degrading complex organic compounds provides new ideas for the restoration of long-term contaminated sites. Although this technology faces challenges such as adaptability to complex geological environments, ecological risk assessment, and technical costs, its prospects are promising and could become an important force in future geological environmental restoration.</li>
