            <h2>Food Safety: Challenges and Responses of Globalization</h2>
            <p>Food safety is not only a crucial topic of globalization but also a microcosm of its complexity. Globalization has brought unprecedented convenience to food production and distribution, but also multiple layers of challenges. In the context of information asymmetry, climate change, cultural differences, and other factors, the global food safety system is facing unprecedented tests.</p>

            <h3>The Dilemma of Traditional Systems and the Revolution of Blockchain Technology</h3>
            <p>The traditional food safety certification system relies on centralized institutions for regulation and certification, exposing obvious shortcomings in terms of information asymmetry, traceability difficulties, and inefficiency. Especially against the backdrop of increasingly complex global supply chains, the transparency and traceability of information have become key to ensuring food safety. The introduction of blockchain technology has completely changed this situation.</p>
            <p>Blockchain, with its decentralized, tamper-proof, and traceable characteristics, provides a new solution for food safety certification. By establishing a "digital vaccination passport," every step from food production to consumption is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring the authenticity and transparency of the information. The application of blockchain technology not only enhances the traceability of food safety but also greatly improves regulatory efficiency by automatically executing food safety standards through smart contracts.</p>

            <h3>Climate Change and the Domino Effect on the Global Food Supply Chain</h3>
            <p>Climate change is triggering a series of domino effects through the global food supply chain, posing a looming threat to global food safety. Extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, have become the norm, significantly impacting agricultural production and the stability of the food supply chain.</p>
            <p>For example, in the Midwest United States, where corn and soybeans are primarily produced, extreme weather-induced crop reductions directly drive up the costs of the global livestock industry, thereby affecting the development of the livestock industry in Asian countries. Drought in India has led to a decrease in wheat exports, triggering food crises in the Middle East and Africa. Climate change is not only a threat to agriculture but also a "summer carnival" for pests and diseases.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Differences and the Gap in Food Safety Perception</h3>
            <p>In the context of globalization, different countries and regions have significant differences in their perceptions and standards of food safety due to historical, cultural, and religious factors. This perception gap is becoming a significant factor limiting global food trade and food safety cooperation.</p>
            <p>The perception differences of food additives in different cultures are particularly evident. Countries in Europe and the United States view food additives as a boost to the development of the food industry, while some Asian and African countries hold a more cautious, and even dismissive, attitude towards them. Genetically modified foods face similar challenges; despite their significant advantages in increasing crop yields and nutritional value, they are resistant due to cultural differences.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Global food safety is a complex multidimensional issue involving technology, environment, culture, and economics. Faced with challenges brought by information asymmetry, climate change, and cultural differences, the international community needs to adopt comprehensive measures. Through technological innovation, international cooperation, and cultural understanding, we can build a safer, more transparent, and efficient global food safety system.</p>
