            <h3>I. Ecological Perspective: The South China Sea as a Shared Boundary of the Global Marine Ecosystem</h3>
            
            <h4>1. The Ecological Uniqueness and Global Significance of the South China Sea</h4>
            <p>As one of the most biodiverse marine regions globally, the South China Sea covers approximately 3.5 million square kilometers and supports thousands of marine species, including endangered ones like dugongs, green sea turtles, hawksbill turtles, and various sharks and whales. Its coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds not only provide crucial support for Southeast Asia's fisheries but are also known as the "tropical rainforests of the ocean." The ecological health of the South China Sea is not only vital for the sustainable development of regional countries but also closely linked to global climate change.</p>
            
            <h4>2. Challenges Facing the South China Sea as a Shared Ecological Boundary</h4>
            <p>Despite its undeniable ecological value, the South China Sea faces significant environmental challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overfishing and Illegal Fishing:</strong> Due to the high dependence of surrounding countries on fishery resources, overfishing has led to a sharp decline in many fish populations, severely threatening ecological balance.</li>
                <li><strong>Coral Reef Degradation:</strong> Ocean acidification and rising sea temperatures caused by climate change, along with human activities like land reclamation and bottom trawling, have led to coral bleaching and death.</li>
                <li><strong>Plastic Pollution and Marine Debris:</strong> The South China Sea is one of the most plastic-polluted seas globally. The accumulation of microplastics in the marine food chain not only threatens marine life but also indirectly affects human health.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact of Geopolitical Conflicts on Ecological Cooperation:</strong> Sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea make it difficult to establish unified ecological governance mechanisms, with countries lacking effective coordination in environmental monitoring, fishery management, and marine protected areas.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>3. Beyond Politics: Building a South China Sea Ecological Cooperation Mechanism</h4>
            <p>Despite complex political differences in the South China Sea, the indivisibility of the ecosystem requires countries to transcend disputes and jointly maintain marine ecological health. Here are some potential cooperation pathways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Establishing a Regional Marine Protected Area Network:</strong> The international community can draw on the Antarctic Treaty model to promote the concept of "ecological co-management zones" in the South China Sea, setting up transnational marine protected areas (MPAs), especially in coral reefs, seagrass beds, and key migratory fish habitats.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening Scientific Cooperation and Data Sharing:</strong> Through the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) or ASEAN frameworks, establish a South China Sea ecological monitoring network to share data on marine pollution, fishery resources, and climate change.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting Sustainable Fishery Management:</strong> South China Sea countries can draw on the spirit of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to establish regional fishery quota systems and combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.</li>
                <li><strong>Addressing Climate Change and Ocean Acidification:</strong> South China Sea countries should jointly participate in global emission reduction commitments and enhance carbon sequestration through the restoration of blue carbon ecosystems like mangroves and seagrass beds.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>II. Digital Geopolitics Perspective: Underwater IoT and the "Invisible Frontier" of the South China Sea</h3>
            
            <h4>1. Underwater IoT: Reshaping the Digital Frontier of Maritime Security</h4>
            <p>Underwater IoT (UIoT) is an intelligent monitoring system composed of underwater sensors, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and seabed observation networks. It can collect real-time data on marine environments, hydrology, and military activities, transmitting it via satellites or submarine cables to data processing centers. The maturity of this technology allows countries to monitor ocean dynamics with unprecedented precision, gaining advantages in military, resource exploration, and environmental monitoring.</p>
            <p>In the South China Sea, the application of UIoT has profound geopolitical implications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Military Reconnaissance and Strategic Deterrence:</strong> Underwater sensor networks can monitor submarine movements, ship activities, and even detect the deployment of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), turning the South China Sea into a "transparent battlefield."</li>
                <li><strong>Data-Driven Resource Competition:</strong> The South China Sea is rich in oil, gas, and mineral resources. UIoT can help accurately map seabed geological structures, enhancing resource development capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Submarine Cables and Digital Sovereignty:</strong> 95% of global international data transmission relies on submarine cables, with the South China Sea being a key node in the Asia-Pacific cable network. Countries controlling cable routes and data can impose "digital blockades" or conduct network surveillance, impacting regional security and the digital economy.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>2. The "Invisible Frontier" of the South China Sea: Data Sovereignty and Rule-Making</h4>
            <p>Traditional geopolitics focuses on physical boundaries, but in the digital age, competition in the South China Sea revolves around "data sovereignty." Whoever controls the collection, transmission, and interpretation of data gains a strategic advantage.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Sovereignty Disputes:</strong> China promotes autonomous control of South China Sea data through its "Smart Ocean" project, leveraging the "Beidou" system to enhance marine monitoring capabilities. The U.S. and its allies, through the "Indo-Pacific Submarine Cable Initiative," aim to weaken China's digital dominance in the South China Sea.</li>
                <li><strong>Rule-Making Competition:</strong> Institutions like the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the International Seabed Authority (ISA) have become new battlegrounds, with countries vying for control over underwater spectrum allocation and data standards.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>3. Challenges and Future Trends</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intensifying Technological Competition:</strong> With advancements in quantum communication and deep-sea AI, the military and commercial value of UIoT will further amplify, potentially sparking a new round of competition over deep-sea data centers and underwater combat networks.</li>
                <li><strong>"Gray Zone" Conflicts in the Digital Frontier:</strong> Unlike traditional maritime conflicts, data theft, cyberattacks, and cable sabotage may become new forms of friction in the South China Sea.</li>
                <li><strong>Multilateral Governance Challenges:</strong> The lack of international regulations on underwater data activities may turn the South China Sea into a "digital anarchy" testing ground, urgently requiring the establishment of data sharing and security cooperation mechanisms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>III. Narrative and Discourse Power Perspective: Who Defines the "South China Sea Story"</h3>
            
            <h4>1. The Power of Narrative: Constructing the "South China Sea Story"</h4>
            <p>Media, diplomatic statements, and academic research not only convey information but also shape national images, international perceptions, and moral high grounds. Beyond Western mainstream media and international law perspectives, Southeast Asian countries, China, and Taiwan are also constructing their own "South China Sea narratives."</p>
            
            <h4>2. Diverse Narratives of Discourse Power</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Analyzing how different countries use discourse to shape roles as "victims," "order maintainers," or "aggressors":</strong> For example, China emphasizes "historical rights" and "peace in the South China Sea" to portray a "peaceful rise," while the U.S. uses "freedom of navigation" and "international law" to highlight its role as an "order maintainer."</li>
                <li><strong>Exploring how social media, documentaries, and films influence younger generations' perceptions of the South China Sea dispute:</strong> Social media and films have become new narrative platforms, conveying information through emotional and visual means, shaping public perceptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Proposing the concept of "coexistence of multiple narratives," promoting cultural and public dialogue over singular nationalist narratives:</strong> In a multicultural context, the South China Sea narrative is not just a battle of discourse power between nations but also a convergence of cultural identities and diverse values.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>3. Future Outlook: Building a "Multilateral Underwater Data Governance Framework"</h4>
            <p>Facing strategic competition in digital geopolitics and marine resources, the international community needs to strengthen coordination and cooperation in the following areas:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Establishing a multilateral underwater data sharing mechanism,</strong> promoting open scientific data platforms while ensuring national security;</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting unified international technical standards,</strong> including UIoT protocols, underwater acoustic communication codes, and security certification systems;</li>
                <li><strong>Conducting multilateral marine governance cooperation,</strong> jointly addressing seabed resource development, ecological protection, and counter-terrorism tasks;</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening "digital ocean" sovereignty awareness,</strong> integrating underwater IoT into national digital infrastructure planning.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The South China Sea is not only a geopolitical arena but also a shared boundary of the global marine ecosystem. Its ecological health directly impacts regional and global environmental security. Facing threats from overexploitation, pollution, and climate change, surrounding countries must transcend political differences to jointly build an ecological governance framework. Only through transnational cooperation can the sustainable development of the South China Sea be achieved, ensuring this critical ecosystem is shared by all humanity.</p>
            <p>In the era of digital geopolitics, competition in the South China Sea has evolved from traditional maritime disputes to a dual contest of "hard power" (military presence) and "soft power" (data control). The deployment of underwater IoT not only enhances countries' maritime awareness but also shapes a new "invisible frontier"—where the collection, transmission, and interpretation of data become the core of power struggles. In the future, "data is sovereignty," "perception is security," and the ability to "control underwater data flows" will become key indicators of a nation's comprehensive competitiveness and geopolitical advantage.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, protecting the ecological health of the South China Sea is not just for the benefit of regional countries but also a part of fulfilling global environmental responsibilities. Only by transcending political differences can we truly achieve a "shared ocean, shared future."</p>
