            <h2>The Anthropocene: New Paradigms in Hydrogeology and Water Resource Management</h2>
            <p>In the Anthropocene era, human activities have reached an unprecedented level of impact on Earth's environment, particularly in the fields of hydrogeology and water resource management. Climate change, land use changes, over-extraction of groundwater, and issues of inequitable access to and pollution of water resources constitute the main challenges of this era. Facing these complex challenges, traditional water resource management methods have become inadequate, necessitating the introduction of new technologies, methodologies, and ideas to achieve sustainable use of water resources and environmental justice.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Climate Change and Its Interaction with Hydrogeology</h3>
            <p>Climate change is one of the most significant environmental issues of the Anthropocene, profoundly affecting hydrogeological processes. Global temperature rise leads to changes in precipitation patterns, glacier melting, sea-level rise, and frequent extreme weather events. These changes not only affect the flow, storage, and quality of surface and groundwater but also complicate water resource management. For example, glacier melting alters river flow, impacting groundwater recharge and surface runoff; sea-level rise may cause saltwater intrusion, contaminating groundwater resources. These phenomena further intensify the frequency and severity of floods and droughts, making water resource management even more challenging.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Land Use Changes and Disruption of the Hydrological Cycle</h3>
            <p>Another significant feature of the Anthropocene is the dramatic change in land use. Urbanization, agricultural expansion, and deforestation have significantly altered the physical properties of land surfaces, affecting the hydrological cycle. Urbanization increases impermeability, reducing groundwater recharge; agricultural activities, such as irrigation and chemical fertilization, not only consume vast amounts of water but also lead to groundwater pollution; deforestation disrupts ecosystems, weakening the natural regulatory capacity of the hydrological cycle. These changes not only affect the distribution and quality of water resources but also negatively impact the stability and functioning of ecosystems, further complicating water resource management and its challenges.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Crisis of Groundwater Over-extraction and Contamination</h3>
            <p>As human demand for groundwater continues to increase, the issue of over-extraction is becoming more severe. Over-extraction causes groundwater levels to drop, affecting the interaction between surface and groundwater, leading to issues such as land subsidence, soil salinization, and ecosystem degradation. Meanwhile, groundwater contamination is also worsening, with industrial, agricultural, and domestic wastewater threatening the safety of groundwater resources. These contaminants not only affect human health but also pose severe threats to ecosystems dependent on groundwater. Addressing these challenges requires sustainable water resource management strategies, including nature-based solutions (such as wetland restoration and vegetation recovery), groundwater recharge and protection measures (such as artificial recharge and pollution control), and the application of hydrogeological models in water resource planning and management.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Artificial Intelligence: A Key Tool from Data to Decision-Making</h3>
            <p>In this context, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology provides powerful support for the process from data to decision-making, significantly enhancing the efficiency and scientific rigor of water resource management. AI integrates remote sensing technology, IoT devices, and automated sensors to collect real-time data on precipitation, groundwater levels, surface water flow, and water quality, and processes and analyzes this data using deep learning algorithms and machine learning models to generate high-precision hydrogeological models. These models can predict interactions between groundwater and surface water, assess the impact of climate change and human activities on water resources, and optimize water resource management strategies, selecting the best management options. Additionally, AI decision support systems (DSS) can analyze hydrogeological data in real-time, provide decision recommendations, support long-term water resource planning, and implement emergency measures, thereby addressing extreme weather events and ensuring water resource security.</p>

            <h3>Environmental Justice: Inequities in Water Access and Pollution</h3>
            <p>From the perspective of environmental justice, issues of water access and pollution become more complex and urgent. Environmental justice emphasizes that all humans, regardless of their socioeconomic status or racial background, should have equal rights to the environment and access to resources. However, inequities in water access are widespread, particularly in developing countries and impoverished communities, where inadequate infrastructure and economic constraints prevent residents from obtaining clean and safe drinking water. Moreover, water pollution is concentrated in low-income communities and minority neighborhoods, where industrial wastewater, agricultural fertilizers, and domestic sewage degrade water quality, threatening residents' health. To address these inequities, governments and relevant institutions should strengthen water resource management, ensure fair distribution of water resources, improve infrastructure, particularly in impoverished communities and rural areas, enhance water supply coverage and water quality monitoring capabilities. Additionally, efforts should be made to control water pollution, strictly regulate industrial and agricultural wastewater discharge, promote public participation and community collaboration, and conduct environmental education and awareness campaigns to increase public understanding of water resource protection and environmental justice.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Policy Innovation: Achieving Sustainable Water Resource Management</h3>
            <p>Facing these complex challenges, interdisciplinary collaboration and policy innovation are key to achieving sustainable water resource management. Hydrogeologists, environmental scientists, sociologists, and policymakers should work together to develop comprehensive water resource management and pollution prevention strategies. For example, by establishing hydrogeological models, predicting the distribution and changes of water resources, providing scientific evidence for policy-making. Additionally, innovative policy tools, such as environmental taxes and compensation mechanisms, can effectively incentivize businesses and residents to reduce water pollution, promoting the realization of environmental justice.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The hydrogeology and water resource management in the Anthropocene era face numerous challenges but also provide new opportunities for achieving sustainable development and environmental justice. Through scientific research and innovative technologies, such as the application of artificial intelligence, we can address issues like climate change, land use changes, and over-extraction of groundwater. Meanwhile, by strengthening water resource management, preventing water pollution, promoting public participation, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, we can achieve fair distribution and sustainable use of water resources in the Anthropocene era, advancing the true realization of environmental justice and ensuring the common prosperity of both humanity and the natural environment.</p>
