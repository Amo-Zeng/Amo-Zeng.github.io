            <h2>Reshaping the Halo: The Power, Market, and Art Debate of Film Awards</h2>
            <p>Film awards, a symbol that blends art with commerce, are not only a significant component of the film industry but also a reflection of power struggles, market operations, and cultural hegemony. From the Oscars' golden statuette to Cannes' Palme d'Or, these awards carry meanings far beyond art itself. When we strip away the surface halo and delve into their operational mechanisms, a complex and sophisticated system gradually emerges. This is not merely a question of artistic evaluation but a profound proposition involving power structures, market logic, and cultural hegemony.</p>

            <h3>I. The Award's Genesis within a Network of Power</h3>
            <p>The birth of film awards has never been a simple aesthetic choice but is deeply embedded in a network of power. The creation of the first Academy Awards in 1929, amid the backdrop of the Great Depression, was essentially a rescue action by the film industry to save itself, as well as an important step in the American construction of cultural hegemony. Over time, this award evolved into a global cultural symbol, spreading Hollywood's values under the guise of art to every corner of the world.</p>
            <p>In international film festivals like Cannes and Venice, we can also see the thick fog of power games. The selection process for the Palme d'Or, on the surface, is a competition of artistic standards, yet it is rife with capital and political struggles. Hollywood, through its alliance with European capital, skillfully embeds American culture into the context of European art; while European filmmakers use the festival platform to counter American hegemony under the banner of artistic innovation. This resistance, seemingly romantic, is actually a subtle collusion of capital and politics.</p>
            <p>The globalization of the film industry has further intensified this power struggle. In recent years, the rise of Asian films in major international film festivals is背后支持 by the strong involvement of capital from countries like China and South Korea. These award selections are no longer purely artistic considerations but become the product of transnational capital operations. In this process, film awards become important links connecting the global cultural industry and a crucial battlefield for countries to争夺cultural discourse.</p>

            <h3>II. Value Reconstruction within Market Logic</h3>
            <p>The impact of film awards on box office and reputation showcases a complex process of value reconstruction. The significance of awards lies not only in artistic recognition but also in how they alter the market fate of films. Winning news often triggers extensive discussions on social media in a short time, boosting the film's attention. Data shows that films nominated for the Best Picture Oscar see an average 30% increase in viewing time within six months of winning. This social effect not only extends the film's life cycle but also creates immense commercial value for streaming platforms.</p>
            <p>The impact of awards on box office presents a more complicated picture. For films that have already achieved market success, awards often bring a "second wave of heat," enhancing box office performance. In 2018, "Roma" saw an 80% increase in North American box office after winning the Oscar. This effect is particularly pronounced in art films; data shows that independent film box office increases by an average of 70%, while mainstream commercial films only see a 20% increase. However, the influence of awards is not eternal; as the number of awards increases, their marginal effect gradually diminishes. The first major award brings an average box office increase of 35%, while the third award only leads to a 10% increase.</p>
            <p>Regional market differences are also worth noting. The North American market is most sensitive to awards, while the Asian market is relatively conservative. In 2019, Oscar-winning films saw a 50% increase in box office in North America and only a 15% increase in East Asia. These differences reflect different cultural acceptances and reveal the limitations of awards as cultural export tools.</p>

            <h3>III. Limitations and Reflections on Artistic Evaluation</h3>
            <p>When we turn our attention to artistic evaluation itself, we find significant limitations in the award system. The award evaluation system reinforces the elitism and hierarchy of art, neglecting its diversity and openness. Many independent filmmakers with innovative spirit may find it difficult to gain recognition due to not conforming to mainstream aesthetic standards. This mechanism, while encouraging innovation, may also lead to innovation suppression and limit the diversity of artistic expression.</p>
            <p>The public's excessive reliance on awards reflects uncertainty in artistic value judgment. Standardized award evaluation may limit the subjectivity and diversity of artistic appraisal. The value of art should not be defined by simple scoring criteria but should retain its openness and uncertainty. The subjectivity in the evaluation process is unavoidable; each jury may be influenced by personal preferences and cultural backgrounds, making the evaluation results often subject to the limitations of the times.</p>
            <p>To break through the limitations of award evaluation, a more diversified evaluation system needs to be established. In addition to traditional award评审, independent curators' recommendations, art critics' scores, and public voting should also be encouraged. These channels can provide exhibition platforms for art works of different styles and concepts, allowing art creation to return to its essence—free expression and innovative exploration.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The essence of film awards is the dual manipulation of art and the market. It is both an evaluation of art and a guide to the market, shaping cultural consumption. In this sense, we should not regard awards as the sole standard of artistic value but should adopt a more open and inclusive mindset towards the diversity of artistic evaluation. Only in this way can cinema truly become a bridge connecting different cultures rather than a tool of cultural hegemony; art can return to its essence and shine with more vibrant colors.</p>
