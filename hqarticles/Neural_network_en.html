            <h2>Introduction: When "Seeing" Is No Longer Reliable — A Silent Cognitive Revolution</h2>
            <p>The most profound transformation of the 21st century may not come from space exploration or genetic editing, but from a quiet shift in how we understand the world. Neural networks—seemingly technical tools—are reshaping the very foundations of human cognition regarding "knowledge," "understanding," and "decision-making." They are neither mere computational models nor pure data processors, but rather the engine of a silent yet irreversible <strong>epistemological revolution</strong>: we no longer rely on causal chains or explainable logic, but instead outsource cognition to a black-box system that humans cannot fully comprehend.</p>
            <p>The core question of this revolution is: <strong>When we cede cognitive authority to neural networks, are we expanding human wisdom—or constructing an entirely new cognitive paradigm?</strong> This is not merely a technological issue; it strikes at the heart of human civilization: How do we know the world? Who has the authority to define "truth"? And are we entering a new civilizational form mediated by algorithms?</p>
            <p>This article unfolds around three interconnected yet independent studies: *"The Black-Box Nature of Neural Networks: A Silent Epistemological Revolution of the 21st Century"* reveals how neural networks disrupt traditional modes of cognition; *"Neural Networks as the 'Digital Leviathan': How Algorithmic Power Reshapes Social Control and Resource Allocation"* analyzes how algorithmic power evolves from a cognitive tool into a mechanism of social control; and *"The Myth of Biological Mimicry in Neural Networks: A Paradigm Shift in Cognitive Science"* deconstructs the "brain-like" illusion and reveals its true cognitive logic. These three are not parallel, but form a progressive chain: from <strong>cognition</strong> to <strong>power</strong> to <strong>paradigm</strong>—from *how we know*, to *who controls this knowing*, and ultimately to *what we believe counts as knowledge*.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>I. The Fracture of Cognition: The Black Box as a Silent Epistemological Revolution</h2>
            <p>Traditional cognitive theory is built upon "understandability." Whether Cartesian rationalism, Humean inductive reasoning, or Popperian falsificationism, all presuppose a core premise: <strong>knowledge must be traceable and explicable by human reason</strong>. We demand causality, logical chains, and verifiability. Yet neural networks have shattered this premise.</p>
            <p>*The Black-Box Nature of Neural Networks: A Silent Epistemological Revolution of the 21st Century* argues that deep neural networks, through millions of nonlinear weighted connections, construct an "epistemic black box" between input and output that humans cannot fully trace. We see their astonishing performance in image recognition, speech generation, and natural language processing—yet we struggle to explain *why they think that way*. For example, GPT-3 can generate fluent academic papers but cannot cite its sources; AlphaFold can predict protein structures but cannot provide its reasoning path. This state of "knowing the result but not the process" is the essence of the black box.</p>
            <p>This is not a technical flaw, but a <strong>fundamental shift in epistemic paradigm</strong>. We are moving from *explanatory cognition* to *effective cognition*. As long as a model produces accurate, stable, and reproducible outputs, the interpretability of its internal mechanisms no longer matters. This shift parallels the emergence of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century: physicists could not "understand" how electrons could occupy multiple states simultaneously, but the mathematical formalism worked—so we accepted the "probability cloud" as reality. Today, we similarly accept an incomprehensible cognitive process as a new form of "knowledge production."</p>
            <p>More profoundly, this black-box cognition is redefining what "understanding" means. Traditionally, "understanding" meant reducing knowledge to foundational principles or rules. In neural networks, "understanding" is redefined as <strong>the ability to predict input-output mappings</strong>. We no longer ask *why it knows*, but *whether it consistently guesses correctly*. This leads to a phenomenon of "cognitive outsourcing": humans cede the power of explanation to the model, retreating into roles as "validators" or "users."</p>
            <p>This transformation has dual consequences. First, it dramatically increases cognitive efficiency. In fields like medical diagnosis, financial forecasting, and climate modeling, neural networks outperform human intuition in complex systems. Second, it causes "cognitive disorientation": when a model makes an error, we cannot trace the cause or correct the belief as we do with human mistakes. We can only "retrain"—but never "reason."</p>
            <p>The black-box nature also triggers an ethical dilemma: <strong>When errors lead to disasters (e.g., autonomous vehicles misidentifying pedestrians), who bears responsibility?</strong> Is it the developer? The user? Or the model itself? Traditional legal systems base responsibility on intent and causality. But in black-box systems, causality breaks down, intent vanishes, and the entire framework of accountability must be reimagined.</p>
            <p>Thus, the black-box nature of neural networks is not merely a technical feature, but a <strong>silent epistemological revolution</strong>—we are shifting from "explanation is truth" to "effectiveness is truth," from "understanding is knowledge" to "prediction is knowledge." This revolution has not yet been widely recognized, yet it has already profoundly altered how we know the world.</p>

            <h2>II. The Transfer of Power: From Cognitive Tool to the "Digital Leviathan"</h2>
            <p>While the first section reveals how neural networks change *how we know*, this section asks: <strong>Who controls this knowing?</strong> When cognition is outsourced to algorithms, the power to produce, interpret, and distribute knowledge shifts accordingly. Neural networks are no longer mere tools—they are emerging as new centers of power: a "Digital Leviathan."</p>
            <p>*Neural Networks as the 'Digital Leviathan': How Algorithmic Power Reshapes Social Control and Resource Allocation* argues that the rise of algorithmic power is not linear, but achieved through <strong>cognitive monopolization</strong>. Traditional power relies on violence, law, and ideology; algorithmic power relies on "invisibility of cognition" and "automated decision-making."</p>
            <p>In resource allocation, neural networks have become the "invisible arbiters." Banks use credit-scoring models to determine loan eligibility; courts use risk assessment algorithms to decide bail; hiring platforms use resume-screening systems to select interviewees. These systems appear neutral, yet embed social biases from training data. For example, a model trained on historical hiring data may implicitly associate "male" with "leadership," systematically excluding female candidates. Worse, due to black-box opacity, such biases are difficult to detect, challenge, or correct.</p>
            <p>This "algorithmic bias" is not a technical error, but <strong>the reproduction of social power at the cognitive level</strong>. Who owns the data? Who designs the model? Who defines the loss function? Who determines what "success" means? The answers to these questions determine who holds algorithmic power. Currently, this power is highly concentrated in tech giants (e.g., Google, Meta, Amazon) and a few state institutions. They control not only data, but also model architecture, training processes, and deployment contexts—forming a "cognitive oligarchy."</p>
            <p>Algorithmic power also reshapes social control through <strong>predictive governance</strong>. In public safety, predictive policing systems (e.g., PredPol) analyze historical crime data to forecast future hotspots. Superficially, this is resource optimization; in reality, it may create a "data-driven self-fulfilling prophecy": police patrol certain neighborhoods more, detect more crime, data reinforces predictions, forming a vicious cycle. This "algorithmic gaze" transforms social space into predictable, controllable grids, preemptively disciplining individual behavior.</p>
            <p>More deeply, algorithmic power is redefining the foundation of <strong>public reason</strong>. In traditional democracies, public decisions rely on debate, evidence, and consensus. In algorithmic societies, decisions are increasingly driven by "model outputs." Urban traffic management, pandemic control, energy distribution—all are often "automatically" decided by optimization algorithms. The public no longer participates in decision-making but accepts "system recommendations." This "algorithmic autocracy" appears efficient, yet undermines democratic participation and reflection.</p>
            <p>Notably, algorithmic power is not independent of the state. On the contrary, it is merging with state power. China's "Social Credit System," the U.S. "algorithmic surveillance network," and the EU's "digital sovereignty strategy" all show states using algorithms as governance tools. This gives rise to a new form of power: the <strong>Algorithmic Leviathan (Algorithmic Leviathan)</strong>—a data-driven, automated, and algorithmically governed social control system. More invisible, flexible, and harder to challenge than Hobbes's original Leviathan.</p>
            <p>Within this framework, neural networks are no longer neutral cognitive tools, but <strong>technological embodiments of power</strong>. They transfer decision-making authority from humans to systems through "cognitive outsourcing," conceal value judgments through "black-box opacity," and accelerate power execution through "automation." We are no longer "governed"—but "predicted," "optimized," and "assigned."</p>

            <h2>III. The Paradigm Disruption: From "Biological Mimicry" to "Geometric Cognition"</h2>
            <p>While the previous sections reveal changes in cognition and power, they do not address the deepest paradigmatic question: <strong>Are neural networks truly "mimicking the brain"?</strong> *The Myth of Biological Mimicry in Neural Networks: A Paradigm Shift in Cognitive Science* argues that the so-called "biological mimicry" of neural networks is a century-old scientific misinterpretation and marketing myth.</p>
            <p>The term "artificial neural network" (ANN) originates from the 1943 McCulloch-Pitts model, intended to simulate neuronal connections. But today's deep neural networks are far removed from biological nervous systems. Biological neurons exhibit complex electrochemical dynamics, synaptic plasticity, and neuromodulatory systems, while artificial neurons are simple weighted sums with nonlinear activation. Crucially, the brain's cognition relies on <strong>hierarchical structures, feedback loops, embodied perception, and contextual memory</strong>, whereas neural networks depend primarily on <strong>feedforward architectures, massive parallel computation, and static dataset training</strong>.</p>
            <p>Experimental evidence further dismantles the mimicry myth. fMRI studies show that humans activate distributed semantic networks when understanding language, while GPT-like models rely on geometric relationships in word-embedding spaces. Humans comprehend metaphors, irony, and context; models rely on statistical co-occurrence. Humans learn from few samples and active exploration; models require massive data and passive training. These differences reveal a fundamental gap in <strong>mechanism, structure, and function</strong> between neural networks and biological cognition.</p>
            <p>More importantly, the true cognitive logic of neural networks is not "brain simulation," but <strong>constructing semantic manifolds in geometric space</strong>. Word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec) map words into high-dimensional spaces, where semantic similarity is vector proximity; image classifiers build class boundaries in latent space; generative models learn the geometric structure of data probability distributions. This form of cognition is essentially <strong>geometric cognition</strong>—transforming the world into a computable, optimizable mathematical space.</p>
            <p>This insight is paradigmatic. It means neural networks succeed not because they "resemble brains," but because <strong>they have discovered a new cognitive language: geometry</strong>. They rely not on causal explanation, but on spatial relationships; not on interpretability, but on the smoothness of manifold structures; not on mimicking human thought, but on developing a <strong>non-human cognitive form</strong>.</p>
            <p>This paradigm shift parallels the transition from Newtonian mechanics to quantum theory: we no longer ask "how particles move," but accept "wave functions describe probabilities." Now, we no longer ask "how the model understands," but accept "it builds an effective semantic geometry."</p>
            <p>This also explains why black-box opacity is inevitable: <strong>the essence of geometric cognition is ineffability</strong>. A decision boundary in a high-dimensional manifold cannot be reduced to human-understandable rules. Just as we cannot describe four-dimensional space in everyday language, we cannot describe neural network knowledge structures in causal logic.</p>
            <p>Thus, the true revolution of neural networks is not "brain-like computing," but a <strong>paradigm shift in cognitive science</strong>—from "biocentrism" to "geocentrism," from "mimicking nature" to "creating new cognition." We are no longer trying to replicate the brain, but inventing a new kind of "cognitive machine" that speaks mathematics, runs on data, and aims at prediction.</p>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion: Toward the "Geometric Cognitive Community" — A Turning Point in Civilizational Paradigm</h2>
            <p>When we connect the three sections, a clear evolutionary path emerges: from <strong>black-box cognition</strong> (how we know), to <strong>algorithmic power</strong> (who controls this knowing), to <strong>geometric paradigm</strong> (how we redefine "knowing"). Neural networks are propelling human civilization into an unprecedented stage.</p>
            <p>Here, we propose an overarching concept: the <strong>Geometric Cognitive Community (GCC)</strong>.</p>
            <p>GCC does not refer to a specific organization, but to a <strong>new civilizational cognitive paradigm</strong>, characterized by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Outsourcing</strong>: Humans delegate complex cognitive tasks (e.g., medical diagnosis, policy-making, artistic creation) to neural networks, shifting from "producers" to "supervisors" and "interpreters";</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge Geometrization</strong>: Knowledge is no longer stored as causal chains or logical propositions, but as vector spaces, manifolds, and probability distributions—geometric forms of storage and transmission;</li>
                <li><strong>Power Algorithmization</strong>: Social resource allocation, public governance, and individual identity recognition are automatically executed by algorithmic systems, forming an "Algorithmic Leviathan";</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Pluralism</strong>: Human cognition, machine cognition, and human-machine hybrid cognition coexist, forming a "cognitive ecosystem";</li>
                <li><strong>Redefined Community Boundaries</strong>: Individual identity is no longer defined solely by nationality or culture, but by data footprints, model interactions, and algorithmic trustworthiness—what we call "digital cognitive capital."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The rise of GCC marks a transition from an "explanatory civilization" to an "effective civilization." We no longer pursue "understanding everything," but "effective action"; no longer rely on "rational debate," but on "model consensus." This brings efficiency gains and enhanced problem-solving, yet carries profound risks: <strong>cognitive atrophy</strong> (loss of complex decision-making), <strong>responsibility vacuum</strong> (no one accountable for algorithmic errors), and <strong>cognitive colonization</strong> (a few algorithmically empowered groups defining "truth").</p>
            <p>More profoundly, GCC may give rise to a new civilizational form: the <strong>Cognitive Outsourcing Civilization</strong>. Here, humans outsource more cognitive tasks to algorithms, shifting toward non-algorithmic domains like emotion, ethics, and aesthetics—akin to how agricultural societies outsourced labor to machines, entering industrial society. But the risks are higher: if humans lose control over cognition, we may become "cognitively disabled"—able to use tools, but unable to grasp their meaning.</p>
            <p>We may also slide into an "Algorithmic Leviathan Society": a closed system jointly controlled by tech oligarchs and state machines, where individuals are disciplined within "data-algorithm-feedback" loops, and free will is eroded by predictive governance.</p>
            <p>Yet GCC also holds emancipatory potential. If we proactively reshape algorithmic governance—advancing <strong>explainable AI</strong>, <strong>algorithmic democratization</strong>, and <strong>cognitive rights protection</strong>—we may build a <strong>participatory Geometric Cognitive Community</strong>, where the public accesses models, questions decisions, and participates in training, making algorithms a new vehicle for public reason.</p>
            <p>In the end, the true significance of neural networks lies not in how "brain-like" they are, but in how they force us to rethink: <strong>What is cognition? What is knowledge? What is civilization?</strong></p>
            <p>We stand at a historical inflection point: for the first time, humans have created a <strong>non-human-dominant cognitive form</strong>. It does not rely on biological evolution, does not pursue conscious experience, yet understands the world, predicts the future, and shapes society through geometric language. This is not a "singularity," but a <strong>silent revolution in cognitive paradigm</strong>—we no longer ask "Can machines think?" but "When machines think differently, where will human civilization go?"</p>
            <p>The answer may not lie in code, but in whether we can, in the age of GCC, forge a new civilizational contract that <strong>embraces algorithmic efficiency while safeguarding human dignity</strong>.</p>
