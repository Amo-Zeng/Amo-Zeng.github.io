            <p>13.8 billion years ago, the universe was born from a scorching singularity, beginning its long and magnificent history of element synthesis. From the initial chaos of hydrogen and helium to the rich symphony of 118 elements today, the periodic table is no longer simply a two-dimensional chart from chemistry textbooks—it is a cosmic autobiography spanning space and time. It tells the story of how galaxies, stars, and even life itself emerged through cosmic evolution.</p>

            <h3>Prologue: From Nothing to Stardust</h3>
            <p>Primordial nucleosynthesis during the Big Bang synthesized hydrogen and helium, which later coalesced under gravity into stars. Inside these stars, nuclear fusion forged heavier elements—carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen—through stellar lifecycles. The explosive deaths of massive stars as supernovae scattered these elements into the interstellar medium, where subsequent generations of stars and planets—including Earth—emerged. The atoms in our bodies are the literal byproducts of stellar alchemy.</p>

            <h3>Stellar Alchemy: The Forge of Elements</h3>
            <p>In the cores of massive stars, fusion proceeds in shells—hydrogen to helium, then helium to carbon and beyond. As temperatures and pressures increase, elements up to iron are formed via nuclear fusion, releasing energy. Beyond iron, heavier elements such as gold and platinum are formed through rapid neutron capture (r-process) during supernovae or neutron star mergers. The universe transforms mass into energy in stars, while simultaneously crafting the chemical diversity necessary for planetary systems and life.</p>

            <h3>Galactic Recycling: From Supernovae to Planets</h3>
            <p>Each supernova explosion enriches the galactic environment with complex elements. Over successive generations, interstellar gas clouds condense into planetary systems with compositions increasingly rich in heavy elements. Observations from telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope provide insights into the chemical fingerprints of distant galaxies and the evolution of cosmic chemistry across billions of years.</p>

            <h3>Into the Unknown: Cosmic Rays and Element Mysteries</h3>
            <p>Cosmic rays—high-energy particles from outer space—reveal traces of rare and exotic isotopes, suggesting unknown element-formation mechanisms in extreme astrophysical environments. These clues challenge our understanding of nuclear physics beyond laboratory conditions and hint at even more exotic processes yet to be discovered in the universe.</p>
