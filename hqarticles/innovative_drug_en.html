            <h2>A Leap in Human Medicine</h2>
            <p>The history of human medicine is a history of continuous pursuit of precision and individualization. From early empirical medicine to modern evidence-based medicine, treatment methods have evolved from vague to scientific, yet they have always struggled to escape the dilemma of "one drug for thousands." With the rapid progress of science and technology, particularly the rise of genomics, proteomics, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and nanotechnology, drug development and delivery systems are undergoing a profound transformation. The ultimate goal of this transformation is to shift from the traditional "one drug for thousands" model to the era of precision medicine, where "thousands of drugs for one" individual. This change is not only a leap in medical science but also a new definition of human health management.</p>

            <h3>Limitations of Traditional Drug Development and Delivery Models</h3>
            <h4>The Dilemma of "One Drug for Thousands"</h4>
            <p>Traditional drug development is centered around diseases, employing a "one-size-fits-all" approach to develop general-purpose drugs targeting specific pathological mechanisms or targets. This model has achieved significant success over the past decades, providing effective treatments for many diseases. However, as scientific research deepens, the limitations of this traditional model are becoming increasingly evident.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Human Complexity:</strong> Each person's genome, metabolic state, immune system, and living environment are unique, leading to significant differences in the efficacy and side effects of the same drug among individuals.</li>
                <li><strong>High Costs and Long Cycles:</strong> The development of general-purpose drugs typically relies on large-scale clinical trials, where the statistical significance of trial results often masks the complexity of individual differences, leading some patients to become "ineffective medication" victims.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Limitations of "Passive Drug Delivery"</h4>
            <p>Traditional drug delivery systems primarily rely on the properties of the drug and its distribution within the body, belonging to "passive drug delivery," which has several limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low Drug Utilization:</strong> The distribution of drugs in the body is systemic, and the concentration of drugs reaching the target site is often low, resulting in poor treatment efficacy.</li>
                <li><strong>High Side Effects:</strong> Drugs that do not reach the target site can act in other parts of the body, potentially causing unnecessary side effects and even harming healthy tissues.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistance Issues:</strong> Long-term use of the same drug can lead to the development of resistance in pathogens, reducing treatment efficacy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Rise of Precision Medicine: From "Lab to Clinic" to "Data-Driven Closed Loop"</h3>
            <h4>Data-Driven Drug Development Closed Loop</h4>
            <p>The data-driven drug development closed loop is data-centric, utilizing technologies such as AI, big data, and cloud computing to integrate multi-source heterogeneous data, enabling intelligent and digitalized processes from drug discovery, screening, clinical trials to market approval.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Multi-Source Data Integration:</strong> By integrating genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, clinical data, chemical data, and literature data, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and drug action principles.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning and Drug Mechanism Prediction:</strong> Machine learning algorithms can predict drug mechanisms, potential side effects, and optimal dosing regimens by training on large amounts of biological and chemical data.</li>
                <li><strong>Virtual Drug Screening:</strong> Virtual screening uses computational models to simulate the interaction between compounds and targets, rapidly identifying candidate compounds with potential activity, greatly shortening the screening time and reducing experimental costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Twin and Personalized Drug Development:</strong> By constructing digital models of patients, researchers can simulate the effects of drugs in specific individuals, enabling personalized drug development.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Active Targeted Drug Delivery Systems</h4>
            <p>To overcome the limitations of traditional "passive drug delivery," scientists are developing new smart drug delivery systems, driving a revolutionary shift from "passive drug delivery" to "active targeting."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biomimetic Drug Delivery Systems:</strong> Biomimetics provides new inspiration for drug delivery systems, such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADC).</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Drug Delivery Systems:</strong> Environment-responsive drug delivery systems can sense specific environmental signals (such as pH, enzyme activity, temperature, light, etc.) and automatically adjust drug release based on these signals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Future Outlook: Intelligent, Personalized, and Multifunctional Drug Systems</h3>
            <h4>Intelligent Drug Delivery Systems</h4>
            <p>Future drug delivery systems will become more intelligent, capable of real-time monitoring of drug delivery processes and dynamically adjusting drug release strategies based on treatment effects.</p>
            <h4>Personalized Drug Development</h4>
            <p>Personalized drug development will design optimal drug delivery plans based on patients' genetic information and disease status, achieving true "thousands of drugs for one."</p>
            <h4>Multifunctional Drug Systems</h4>
            <p>Future drug delivery systems will not be limited to drug delivery but will also have diagnostic, imaging, and therapeutic functions, achieving integrated diagnosis and treatment.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Challenges and Prospects</h3>
            <p>Although the prospects for personalized drugs and intelligent delivery systems are exciting, their widespread application still faces many challenges. First, there are technical issues such as the interpretation of genomic data, the integration of multi-omics data, and the reliability of AI models. Second, there are ethical and legal issues, such as privacy protection of genetic information, personalized drug pricing, and the allocation of medical resources. Additionally, the development and production costs of personalized drugs may be significantly higher than those of traditional drugs, raising questions about how to balance costs and benefits.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The transition from "one drug for thousands" to "thousands of drugs for one" marks the entry of medicine into a new era. In this era, drug development and delivery systems will become more precise, intelligent, and personalized, providing patients with the most suitable treatment options. Through the power of technology, we will eventually bring the most suitable medical solutions to everyone, achieving true "health equity." This revolution not only propels the advancement of medical science but also redefines human health management.</p>
