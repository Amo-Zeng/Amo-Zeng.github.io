            <h2>New Extensions in Ontology</h2>
            <p>Ontology, as a core area of philosophical inquiry, has long provided us with profound insights into life, consciousness, and entities. However, with the rapid development of technology, the widespread exchange of culture, and the growing awareness of ecological issues, our understanding of "existence" is undergoing an unprecedented expansion and deepening. This article aims to construct a multidimensional ontological framework by integrating the dialectical relationship between nothingness and becoming, the new challenges of digital existence, and the meaning of existence from a cross-species perspective, to delve into the rich connotations of "existence" at different levels and backgrounds.</p>

            <h3>Nothingness and Becoming: The Dynamic Nature of Existence</h3>
            <p>Traditional ontology often regards "existence" as a static and definite state, ignoring the dynamic processes of "nothingness" and "becoming." However, "nothingness" is not merely a lack of existence but a potential, unrealized "presence." It is the beginning of all becoming and change, and can be seen as "the possibility of existence." As Heidegger said, "nothingness" is a positive force that inspires new possibilities and breaks old structures.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creativity of Nothingness:</strong> In artistic creation and scientific innovation, "nothingness" demonstrates its positive creative power. A blank canvas or an unencoded digital space (nothingness) is the source of an artist's creativity, allowing infinite possibilities to unfold; in scientific innovation, "nothingness" may manifest as unexplored theoretical spaces or unsolved puzzles, inspiring scientists to generate new concepts and models to fill these gaps.</li>
                <li><strong>Relationship Between Becoming and Existence:</strong> We can understand "existence" as a momentary state of "becoming," while "becoming" itself is a dynamic "existence." Every "being" is formed in a continuous process of becoming. This perspective breaks the binary opposition between "existence" and "becoming," viewing "becoming" as the core feature of existence.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Perspective:</strong> Different cultures have varying understandings and expressions of "nothingness" and "existence." In Buddhism, the concept of "Śūnyatā" emphasizes the temporariness and non-self-nature of all phenomena, considering "emptiness" as the fundamental characteristic of existence. This is different from the Western philosophical view of "nothingness," which tends to see it as the opposite of existence rather than its essence. Heidegger's concept of "existence" is closely linked to "nothingness," believing that "existence" manifests itself through "nothingness." This perspective has some similarities with Buddhism's "Śūnyatā," both emphasizing the dynamism and possibility of existence.</li>

            <h3>Digital Existence: Constructing "Digital Ontology"</h3>
            <p>With the rapid development of digital technology, human existence is undergoing a profound transformation. This transformation not only changes the way we interact with the world but also presents new challenges to our understanding of existence. This article focuses on "digital existence" and attempts to construct a "digital ontology" to explore the new challenges digital existence poses to the essence of "existence."</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identity Recognition:</strong> In the digital world, the definition of "identity recognition" becomes increasingly complex. Traditional identity recognition is based on biological characteristics and social relationships, but in digital environments, our identity is often expressed through digital avatars and digital archives. Digital avatars are our projections in virtual spaces, representing not only our online images but also the symbol of our digital existence. Digital archives are the "traces of existence" in the digital world, recording our behaviors, preferences, social relationships, and other information. These data not only shape our digital identities but also influence our perception of our own existence.</li>
                <li><strong>Data and Information:</strong> Data is not only a carrier of information but can also be considered a new form of existence. Through the collection, analysis, and utilization of data, we can construct a complete "profile" of an individual, which includes not only the characteristics of the physical world but also the behavioral patterns in the digital world. However, data as a form of existence also raises ethical and legal challenges. Issues such as data governance, privacy protection are closely related to the ethical boundaries of "existence." The ownership, usage rights, and risks of data leakage all involve the rights of individual "existence."</li>
                <li><strong>Metaverse and Virtual Reality:</strong> The metaverse is a virtual world composed of virtual reality, augmented reality, and internet technologies, providing humans with a new living space. In this space, the boundaries between the real and virtual, substance and information become blurred, even intertwined. Virtual reality in the metaverse not only changes our perception of space but also our understanding of time, emotion, and identity. In this context, the boundary between "real" and "virtual" becomes blurred, forcing us to redefine the essence of "existence."</li>

            <h3>Cross-Species Perspective: A Multiverse of Existence</h3>
            <p>Re-examining the meaning of "existence" from a cross-species perspective leads us towards a broader and more diverse view of the universe. Humans, with their unique intellectual and cultural achievements, often overlook the value of other species. However, with the deepening of scientific research and the awakening of ecological awareness, we begin to realize that the diversity of life is not just the decoration of the earth, but part of the cosmic evolution. Each species reveals the deep meaning of "existence" in its unique way of existence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensory Capabilities:</strong> Studies on animal behavior show that many species have complex emotions and cognitive abilities. For example, elephants' mourning behavior, dolphins' social networks, and birds' singing art are not just survival instincts but expressions of an "existence" experience similar to humans yet different. Animals' emotions and consciousness may not be mediated by language, but they demonstrate perception and response to the environment through behavior, sound, and physiological reactions. This cross-species sensory capability reveals the diversity of "existence."</li>
                <li><strong>Integrity of Ecosystems:</strong> In ecosystems, each species is a node in the network, interdependent and maintaining ecological balance. This interdependence is not just a biological fact but a profound interpretation of the meaning of "existence." The stability of ecosystems depends on the role of each species, which is not only functional but also existential. For example, bees' existence is not just a tool for pollination, their dancing, foraging behavior, and interaction with other organisms form a complex ecological culture.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Framework:</strong> To achieve harmonious coexistence between humans and non-human species, we need to build a new ethical framework. Traditional ethics often center on humans, ignoring the rights of other species. However, from a cross-species perspective, we can propose the concept of "species equality," that is, all species have equal value and rights. In this way, we can build a more inclusive ontology, connecting human existence with the existence of the entire ecosystem.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion: Multidimensional Ontology</h3>
            <p>By integrating the dialectical relationship between nothingness and becoming, the new challenges of digital existence, and the meaning of existence from a cross-species perspective, this article constructs a multidimensional ontological framework. Under this framework, "existence" is no longer a single, static state but a dynamic, diverse, and interrelated process. Nothingness and becoming reveal the dynamic nature of existence, digital existence brings new identity and ethical challenges, and the cross-species perspective shows the diversity and ecological integrity of existence.</p>
