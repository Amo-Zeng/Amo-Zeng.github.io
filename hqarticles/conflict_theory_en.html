            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the context of the rapid development of digital technology and the acceleration of globalization, human society is entering an unprecedentedly complex era. This era not only brings technological progress and economic prosperity but also triggers a series of profound social conflicts. These conflicts are not only reflected in technological and economic changes but also deeply influence social structures, environmental justice, and cultural identities.</p>

            <h2>I. Algorithmic Hegemony and Data Exploitation in the Digital Age</h2>
            <h3>1. Formation and Social Impact of Algorithmic Hegemony</h3>
            <p>Algorithmic hegemony refers to the phenomenon in the digital economy where a few enterprises or platforms with advanced algorithms and massive data dominate the market and user behavior. This phenomenon is formed due to the network effects of internet platforms, the application of big data technology, and the complexity and closed nature of algorithms.</p>
            <h3>2. Manifestations of Data Exploitation and Social Inequality</h3>
            <p>Data exploitation refers to the phenomenon where platform enterprises profit immensely by collecting, analyzing, and utilizing user data, while users themselves cannot benefit from it and may even suffer losses.</p>
            <h3>3. The Ownership Dispute Over Data Between Users and Platforms</h3>
            <p>The issue of data ownership between users and platforms has become a significant source of conflict. Users believe they are the owners of their personal data and have the right to decide how it is collected, used, and shared; while platform enterprises argue that they have invested heavily in developing data collection and analysis technologies and should have corresponding data ownership.</p>
            <h3>4. Rights Protection in Algorithmic Decision-Making</h3>
            <p>The widespread application of algorithms raises a series of rights protection issues. The transparency and interpretability of algorithms make it difficult for users to understand and supervise the process of algorithmic decision-making, potentially depriving them of basic rights.</p>

            <h2>II. Ecological Conflicts: Environmental Justice and Sustainable Development</h2>
            <h3>1. The Essence of Ecological Conflicts: Uneven Distribution of Environmental Resources and Lack of Justice</h3>
            <p>The root of ecological conflicts lies in the uneven distribution of environmental resources and the lack of environmental justice. Developed countries have accumulated wealth through historically high-pollution, high-energy-consumption development models but have shifted the costs of environmental pollution to developing countries and other vulnerable groups.</p>
            <h3>2. Driving Factors of Ecological Conflicts: Conflict Between Economic Development Models and Ecological Values</h3>
            <p>Ecological conflicts also arise from the inherent contradiction between economic development models and ecological values. Since the Industrial Revolution, human society has focused on economic growth, neglecting the carrying capacity and sustainability of ecological systems.</p>
            <h3>3. Solutions to Ecological Conflicts: Coordinated Promotion of Environmental Justice and Sustainable Development</h3>
            <p>Resolving ecological conflicts requires taking environmental justice as a prerequisite and sustainable development as a goal, exploring new social development models.</p>

            <h2>III. Social Mobility and Cultural Conflicts: Identity and Social Change</h2>
            <h3>1. Social Mobility: A Catalyst for Cultural Conflicts</h3>
            <p>Social mobility, the movement of individuals or groups across social classes, occupations, and regions, is a significant characteristic of modern society. The globalization wave and the development of information technology have broken down geographical and cultural boundaries, enabling people to move more easily between different countries and regions.</p>
            <h3>2. Cultural Conflicts: The Dilemma of Identity</h3>
            <p>The essence of cultural conflicts is the dilemma of identity. In the era of globalization, people's identities have become more complex and diverse. Individuals may simultaneously possess multiple identities, such as race, ethnicity, religion, profession, and region, which may conflict with each other.</p>
