            <h2>Integrated Applications of Geothermal Energy in Agriculture and Energy Supply: Green Innovation and Sustainable Development</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>As global energy crises and environmental issues become increasingly severe, finding sustainable energy solutions has become one of the top priorities for governments and scientists around the world. Geothermal energy, with its clean, renewable, and stable characteristics, has emerged as a field with great potential for research and application. This article delves into the diverse applications of geothermal energy in agriculture and energy supply, covering greenhouse farming, subsea geothermal power generation, and community microgrids, demonstrating how geothermal energy can drive green innovation and economic benefits.</p>

            <h3>I. Applications of Geothermal Energy in Agriculture: Greenhouse Effect and Economic Benefits</h3>
            <p>The application of geothermal energy in agriculture is mainly reflected in greenhouse farming:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Provision of Constant Temperature Conditions:</strong> By providing hot water or steam from geothermal wells, geothermal energy maintains a constant temperature inside greenhouses, effectively extending the growing season and increasing yield. For example, in Iceland, 95% of greenhouses use geothermal heating, significantly reducing dependency on traditional energy sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduction in Fossil Fuel Use:</strong> Traditional greenhouses rely on fossil fuels for heating, emitting large amounts of greenhouse gases. Geothermal energy greenhouses are nearly emission-free, reducing approximately 20-30 kg of carbon dioxide emissions per square meter annually.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic and Employment Promotion:</strong> Geothermal greenhouses not only lower energy costs and increase farmers' incomes but also create employment opportunities, driving local economic development. For instance, geothermal greenhouse projects in Shandong and Hebei have become key drivers of local economic growth.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>II. The Development Potential and Applications of Subsea Geothermal Energy</h3>
            <p>Subsea geothermal energy, due to its abundant resources and unique environmental conditions, shows great promise for application:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Energy Utilization at Plate Boundaries and Seafloor Volcanoes:</strong> Areas like the Pacific Ring of Fire provide rich geothermal energy through seafloor volcanoes and hot springs. With technological innovation, subsea geothermal energy can be used for energy supply to islands, powering deep-sea exploration equipment, and subsea geothermal power stations.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Challenges and Future Prospects:</strong> Despite facing challenges such as high-pressure environments, corrosive conditions, and economic viability, future technological advancements and international cooperation will promote the widespread use of subsea geothermal energy, offering more clean energy options.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>III. Geothermal Energy and Community Microgrids: Energy Autonomy for Small Communities</h3>
            <p>The application of geothermal energy in small communities primarily manifests in microgrid systems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> Through geological surveys to identify geothermal resources, designing microgrids with geothermal power systems and smart controls to address energy supply issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Benefits and Community Engagement:</strong> While the initial investment is high, the long-term benefits are stable. Communities can manage through cooperatives or public-private partnerships, achieving energy autonomy and economic returns.</li>
                <li><strong>Management Models and Social Acceptance:</strong> Education and training of community members are needed to increase project transparency and participation, ensuring smooth project execution and safeguarding community interests.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>IV. Integrated Applications and Challenges</h3>
            <p>The comprehensive application of geothermal energy in agriculture, subsea energy development, and community microgrids, while promising, also faces numerous challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical and Resource Constraints:</strong> Uneven distribution of geothermal resources across different regions, high technical requirements, and significant initial investments.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> The need to assess impacts on ecosystems and ensure environmentally friendly development activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Policy Support and International Cooperation:</strong> Government policy support and international technical exchanges are necessary to promote the widespread application of geothermal energy.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Geothermal energy, as a versatile renewable energy source, shows powerful potential in agriculture, energy supply, and community energy autonomy. Through technological innovation, policy support, and international cooperation, geothermal energy can not only provide clean energy but also promote economic development, create job opportunities, and drive a global shift towards a more sustainable energy system. The future challenges lie in overcoming technical barriers, reducing costs, and ensuring environmental protection during development to truly achieve green innovation and sustainable development with geothermal energy.</p>
