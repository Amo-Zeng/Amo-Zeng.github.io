            <h3>Canvas as the Foundation for WebAR</h3>
            <p>Canvas is not just a tool for data visualization; its integration with WebGL and WebXR makes it an ideal platform for Web Augmented Reality (WebAR):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical Implementation</strong>: With WebGL, Canvas can create complex 3D environments; the WebXR Device API allows web pages to interact with AR devices, providing an immersive user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Scenarios</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Furniture Preview: Users can view furniture placement in real-time through a web camera at home.</li>
                        <li>Education and Training: Enhancing learning through Canvas by displaying anatomical models or historical ruins.</li>
                        <li>Games and Entertainment: Offering simple AR game experiences without additional applications.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, developers face challenges such as performance optimization, device compatibility, user privacy, and security when implementing these applications.</p>
