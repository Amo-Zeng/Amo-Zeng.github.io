            <h3>I. Digital Technologies Empowering Zero Emissions</h3>
            <h4>Smart Grids and Energy Optimization</h4>
            <p>In the application of digital transformation in the energy sector, smart grids play a crucial role. Through IoT technology, smart grids can achieve:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Monitoring</strong>: Using sensors and smart meters to precisely monitor power consumption, reduce waste, and enhance energy efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Demand Response</strong>: By predicting and balancing supply and demand during peak usage times, reducing the reliance on additional power generation facilities, and lowering carbon emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Storage and Distributed Generation</strong>: Integrated with home solar systems, it achieves localized storage and use of electricity, reducing transmission losses and promoting widespread use of renewable energy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Blockchain Technology and Carbon Credit Management</h4>
            <p>Blockchain offers new possibilities for carbon emissions management:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Carbon Credit Tracking</strong>: Ensuring transparency and traceability in carbon trading, reducing fraud risks, and increasing market confidence.</li>
                <li><strong>Renewable Energy Certification</strong>: Verifies and records the production and consumption of green energy, ensuring that the electricity consumers purchase is environmentally friendly, promoting the development of the green energy market.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Contracts</strong>: Automating carbon credit transactions to enhance transaction efficiency and accuracy, reducing operational costs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Big Data Analysis and Decision Support</h4>
            <p>Big data analytics provides decision support for energy use optimization:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Predictive Analytics</strong>: Forecasting energy needs based on historical data, optimizing production and consumption plans to reduce waste and costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Efficiency Optimization</strong>: Identifying and improving inefficient aspects of energy use, enhancing overall energy efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavior Change</strong>: Analyzing user behavior data to design incentives for changing high carbon emission behaviors, promoting environmental awareness.</li>
            </ul>
