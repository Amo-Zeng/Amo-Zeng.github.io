            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Alvin Gouldner's academic journey is akin to an intellectual awakening, evolving from an early devotion to the scientific study of sociology to a profound critique of modernity. His intellectual trajectory not only mirrors personal inner struggles but also represents a far-reaching intellectual liberation movement. Gouldner's theoretical contributions, particularly his insights into the power dynamics in knowledge production, the power games within academic communities, and the role of dissent in the evolution of civilization, offer us profound understanding and critical perspectives.</p>

            <h3>Early Belief in the Scientific Study of Sociology and the Impact of the Vietnam War</h3>
            <p>During his tenure as an assistant professor at the University of Michigan, Gouldner attempted to study sociology in a "scientific" manner, striving to elevate the discipline to a pure theoretical realm. His early work focused on the sociology of science, aiming to uncover the mechanisms of knowledge production and dissemination through empirical research and social structure analysis. This period saw Gouldner deeply influenced by positivism and functionalism, believing that sociology should pursue objectivity and scientific rigor to reveal the workings of society.</p>
            <p>However, the brutality of the Vietnam War and the conservatism within academia gradually awakened Gouldner to the realization that scientific sociology had become a tool for consolidating power, with intellectuals serving as pawns of ideology. The outbreak of the Vietnam War allowed him to witness firsthand how scientific knowledge was used to justify imperialism and war. The conservatism within academia further exposed the power dynamics in knowledge production, rendering scientific sociology a tool for maintaining the existing order.</p>

            <h3>The Turn to Critique of Modernity and Theoretical Contributions</h3>
            <p>This awakening prompted Gouldner to embark on a comprehensive reflection on modernity. In *The Coming Crisis of Western Sociology*, he exposed the ideological traps in knowledge production with a sharp pen, calling for the establishment of an independent and truly critical sociology. He argued that modern sociology had become a vassal of power structures, losing its critical and independent nature. Gouldner believed that sociology should re-examine its methodology and theoretical foundations, breaking free from the constraints of positivism and functionalism, and adopting a more critical and reflective research path.</p>
            <p>Gouldner's theoretical contributions are primarily reflected in the following areas:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Introduction of Critical Theory</strong>: Gouldner introduced critical theory into sociology, emphasizing the critical and reflective nature of the discipline. He called on sociologists not only to reveal the workings of society but also to critically examine its power structures and ideologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Sociology of Knowledge Production</strong>: Gouldner explored the power dynamics in knowledge production, revealing how knowledge becomes a tool of power. He argued that knowledge production is not a neutral process but is deeply influenced by social structures and power relations.</li>
                <li><strong>Critique of Modernity</strong>: Gouldner offered a profound critique of modernity, arguing that modern sociology had become a vassal of power structures, losing its critical and independent nature. He called for sociology to re-examine its methodology and theoretical foundations, adopting a more critical and reflective research path.</li>

            <h3>Power Games within Academic Communities: The Dilemma of Business Schools</h3>
            <p>In his book *Science and Social Order* (1970), American sociologist Alvin Gouldner elucidated the dynamic process of knowledge production through the dialectical relationship between power and knowledge. Gouldner argued that academic communities are not纯洁的知识殿堂， but are filled with power struggles, where knowledge producers are both creators of knowledge and practitioners of power. This perspective provides an important theoretical framework for understanding the current predicament of contemporary business schools.</p>
            <p>The rapid rise of business schools itself represents a silent revolution. In the latter half of the 20th century, management studies rapidly transformed from a marginal discipline into a prominent subject in universities, with MBA programs proliferating and the prestige of business schools skyrocketing. Behind this revolution is the comprehensive infiltration of capitalist logic into the education sector. Business schools are no longer merely academic institutions but have become knowledge factories for capitalist expansion, producing "professional managers" who understand both business operations and capital dynamics.</p>
            <p>In this revolution, the power structure has undergone a fundamental shift. Traditional academic authority has given way to management elites, and the role of faculty has shifted from knowledge transmitters to "professional trainers." Gouldner's concept of "internal colonization" is especially evident in business schools: academic power is replaced by administrative power, pure academic research is marginalized by application-oriented research, and faculty academic freedom is increasingly constrained by standardized evaluation systems.</p>
            <p>The root of the discipline's predicament lies in the alienation of knowledge production methods. Management research increasingly serves the interests of capital, with research topics chasing market trends, research methods emphasizing quantification and operability, and research outcomes catering to corporate needs. This phenomenon can be understood as "commodification of knowledge" in Gouldner's theory—knowledge is no longer pure knowledge but becomes a commodity that generates economic benefits. The case teaching method in MBA programs is a typical example; it packages real-world business problems into teaching cases, essentially providing ready-made solutions for businesses.</p>
            <p>Knowledge production in business schools is inherently utilitarian. Gouldner pointed out that "usefulness" has become the primary criterion for measuring the value of knowledge. Under this orientation, management research tends to focus on short-term, utilitarian issues, neglecting long-term social responsibilities and value concerns. In recent years, the increase in ethical issues studied in business schools often remains superficial, lacking in-depth theoretical exploration. This phenomenon reflects the compromises of knowledge producers under capitalist logic.</p>
            <p>The alienation of knowledge production methods leads to the decline of academic communities. Gouldner's description of the "academic polis" gradually disintegrates, replaced by a community of interests composed of corporations, universities, and management elites. The relationship between teachers and students has fundamentally changed; teachers are no longer merely knowledge transmitters but have become tools for capitalist expansion.</p>
