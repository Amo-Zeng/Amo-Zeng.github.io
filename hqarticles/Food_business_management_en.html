            <h2>From Farm to Table: How Blockchain Technology is Revolutionizing Food Enterprise Supply Chain Management</h2>
            <h3>Pain Points in Traditional Food Supply Chain Management</h3>
            <p>In traditional food supply chains, issues such as information asymmetry, difficulty in traceability, and trust crises are major pain points. Consumers struggle to obtain complete product information, increasing uncertainty during purchases. When food safety issues arise, traditional supply chains often fail to quickly trace the source of the problem, leading to high recall costs and a decline in consumer trust.</p>
            <h3>Core Advantages of Blockchain Technology</h3>
            <p>Blockchain technology offers new possibilities to address these issues through its core advantages of decentralization, immutability, and traceability. Decentralization eliminates centralized management institutions in traditional supply chains, enabling direct information sharing among all participants and reducing information asymmetry. The immutable nature ensures data integrity and authenticity, providing a solid foundation for supply chain transparency. Traceability records data from every step, from raw material sourcing to final product sales, allowing all information to be traced and significantly enhancing supply chain transparency.</p>
            <h3>Application Cases of Blockchain Technology in the Food Industry</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Walmart's Blockchain Pilot Project</strong>: Walmart partnered with IBM to use blockchain technology for tracking food supply chains. Through blockchain, Walmart can real-time track the origin and transportation process of food, ensuring safety. For example, in 2018, Walmart completed the traceability of a batch of mangoes in 2.2 seconds using blockchain, while traditional methods took seven days.</li>
                <li><strong>Nestlé's Blockchain Transparency Project</strong>: Nestlé provides consumers with complete supply chain information through blockchain technology. Consumers can scan a QR code on the product to view production dates, raw material sources, processing procedures, and more, enhancing consumer trust in the brand.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>How Blockchain Technology Enhances Supply Chain Transparency, Ensures Food Safety, and Builds Consumer Trust</h3>
            <p>Blockchain technology records data from every step, making each stage of the supply chain transparent. This not only improves efficiency but also reduces information asymmetry. Traceability allows for quick identification and resolution of food safety issues. Once a problem is detected, enterprises can quickly trace it to its source, conduct effective recalls and handling, and minimize the impact of food safety incidents. Through blockchain, consumers can access complete supply chain information, understanding the origin and processing of products. This transparency greatly enhances consumer trust in the brand and increases brand loyalty.</p>
