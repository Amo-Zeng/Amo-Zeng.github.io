            <h2>Standards: The Basic Logic of Modern Society</h2>
            <p>The term "standard," seemingly ordinary, actually carries the basic logic of modern society's operation. From food labels in daily life to technical specifications in industrial fields, standards serve as an invisible thread that weaves the fragmented world into an organic whole. In the age of interconnectedness, the role of standards has transcended simple technical specifications, evolving into a new paradigm of social governance.</p>

            <h3>From "What Standard Do I Want" to "What Standard Do You Need"</h3>
            <p>Traditional standard-setting processes are often top-down, driven by technology leaders or industry giants who create standards based on their own needs and then promote them to the market. While this model ensures technological leadership and industrial uniformity, it often overlooks actual user needs and diversity. Against the backdrop of digitalization and globalization, this singular standard-setting model is increasingly unable to adapt to the complex and ever-changing market environment and growing personalized demands.</p>
            <p>A user-oriented standard-setting model, shifting from "What Standard Do I Want" to "What Standard Do You Need," is becoming a new trend. This model emphasizes a user-centric approach, through extensive user research and demand analysis, to create standards that better align with market realities, are more inclusive and flexible. This shift not only enhances the applicability and popularity of standards but also stimulates market innovation and drives diversified industrial development.</p>

            <h3>The Value and Reconstruction of the Standard Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>The value of the standard ecosystem lies in achieving deep integration across different fields and levels. In the field of intelligent manufacturing, the IEC's standard system tightly connects traditionally separate industries such as machinery, electronics, and software, driving the digital transformation of manufacturing. In the digital economy, IEEE's IoT standards provide a unified "language" for billions of devices, enabling seamless integration between the physical and digital worlds.</p>
            <p>However, traditional standard ecosystems are often closed, dominated by a few giant companies or organizations, leading to monopolistic standard-setting and market imbalance. The new "Standard+" paradigm is reshaping this traditional ecosystem by adopting an open and shared philosophy, attracting more participants and forming a diverse, collaborative standard ecosystem. This reconstruction not only breaks down technical barriers but also promotes effective resource allocation and widespread innovation diffusion.</p>

            <h3>Global Governance and the "Standard+" Era</h3>
            <p>Global governance is entering the "Standard+" era. Solutions to global challenges such as climate change, the digital divide, and public health require the establishment of multilateral cooperation mechanisms based on standards. These mechanisms must not only address technical unification issues but also foster a shared value recognition and action guidelines. Standards are no longer simple technical documents but collective wisdom crystallizing human societal progress.</p>
            <p>In the "Standard+" era, the formulation and implementation of standards need to focus more on global perspectives and long-term interests. By building an open, inclusive, and mutually beneficial standard ecosystem, countries and stakeholders can jointly participate in the standard-setting process, ensuring fairness and universality of standards. This multilateral cooperation mechanism not only solves technical unification issues but also promotes international trust and cooperation, advancing the improvement and progress of the global governance system.</p>

            <h3>Data and Intelligence: Empowering the Digital Transformation of Standard Setting</h3>
            <p>Pushed by the digital wave, the traditional technical management activity of standard setting is undergoing profound transformation. The introduction of data and intelligent technologies not only provides new tools and methods for standard setting but fundamentally reshapes the logic and paradigm of standard setting. Driven by data empowerment and intelligent technology, standard setting is evolving from static technical specifications to dynamic ecosystem collaboration, from a closed system to an open platform, and from a single decision-making model to a diverse co-creation mechanism.</p>
            <h4>Data: The "New Oil" of Standard Setting</h4>
            <p>Data has become the core resource of the digital age, and its role is even more crucial in standard setting. Traditional standard setting relies on limited market research and expert experience, often failing to capture extensive market needs and complex technical evolution trends. In the context of digital transformation, massive user data, device data, market data, and operational data provide unprecedented resources for standard setting.</p>
            <h4>Intelligence: The "New Engine" of Standard Setting</h4>
            <p>The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology is injecting new momentum into standard setting. Machine learning, natural language processing, and knowledge graph technologies are providing more efficient and intelligent tools and methods for standard setting.</p>
            <h4>Two-Way Empowerment of Data and Intelligence: Building a Dynamic Standard Ecosystem</h4>
            <p>The two-way empowerment of data and intelligence is driving standard setting from static technical specifications to dynamic ecosystem collaboration. Through data collection and analysis, standard setters can track changes in market demands and technical trends in real time; through intelligent technology applications, they can respond and adapt to these changes quickly. This dynamic standard setting model not only enhances flexibility and adaptability but also strengthens ecosystem collaboration capabilities.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Shaping the Path of Global Development</h3>
            <p>At this historical juncture, the "Standard+" concept is reshaping the path of global development. By building an open, inclusive, and mutually beneficial standard ecosystem, we can create a more collaborative and sustainable development model. This is not only the inevitable choice of technological innovation but also the path to human civilization progress.</p>
