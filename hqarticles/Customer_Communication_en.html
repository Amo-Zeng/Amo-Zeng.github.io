            <h3>I. The Foundation of Data-Driven Approach: Big Data and Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <h4>1. The Power of Big Data</h4>
            <p>Big data technology enables businesses to collect and process vast amounts of customer data, including browsing behavior, purchase records, and social media interactions. These data provide businesses with rich information sources. Using big data analysis tools, businesses can uncover latent customer needs, behavior trends, and emotional inclinations.
