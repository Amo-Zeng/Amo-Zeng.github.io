            <h2>Supramolecular Precision Assembly Driven by Dynamic Covalent Chemistry: Structural Reconfiguration and Functional Transition in Rearrangement Reactions</h2>
            <p>Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DCC) offers a novel paradigm for constructing complex functional materials by combining the dynamic nature of reversible covalent bonds with the precise recognition of supramolecular interactions. Within this system, rearrangement reactions traditionally considered irreversible or difficult to control (such as the pinacol rearrangement, Cope rearrangement, and Claisen rearrangement) are increasingly becoming important tools for achieving precise assembly and dynamic response in supramolecular systems, due to their unique <strong>topological reconfiguration capabilities, condition dependency, and tunability</strong>. These reactions not only enable structural transformations at the molecular level but can also drive macroscopic property leaps at the material scale through guidance by the supramolecular environment.</p>

            <h3>I. Unique Advantages of Rearrangement Reactions in DCC: Structural Dynamicity and Controllable Response Mechanisms</h3>
            <p>Compared to traditional DCC reactions (such as imine exchange, transesterification, etc.), rearrangement reactions exhibit three significant advantages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Topological Structural Reconfiguration Capability</strong>: Many rearrangement reactions (e.g., sigmatropic rearrangements, carbocation rearrangements) significantly alter the topological connectivity of the molecular skeleton. For instance, the Cope rearrangement converts 1,5-dienes into isomeric products via [3,3]-sigmatropic shift, causing fundamental changes in molecular conformation and spatial arrangement of functional groups, thereby providing new structural motifs for supramolecular assembly.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Threshold and Selective Triggering Mechanism</strong>: Rearrangement reactions typically have high energy barriers and require specific stimuli (e.g., light, heat, pH, or catalyst) to trigger. This characteristic imparts a "switch"-like behavior, useful for designing stimulus-responsive materials. For example, the Claisen rearrangement can be activated under mild heating conditions (60–80°C), achieving the conversion from allyl vinyl ether to unsaturated carbonyl compounds, accompanied by significant polarity changes that subsequently affect supramolecular assembly behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategies for Achieving Dynamic Reversibility</strong>: Although many rearrangement reactions are thermodynamically biased towards one side, dynamic control over the rearrangement direction can be achieved through system design (e.g., coupling equilibrium reactions, introducing reversible catalysts, or incorporating photoresponsive groups). For instance, under acidic conditions, the pinacol rearrangement can establish and reconfigure dynamic covalent networks through the reversible generation and migration of carbocation intermediates.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>II. Supramolecular Template-Guided Control of Rearrangement Pathways: Precise Programming from Molecules to Materials</h3>
            <p>Supramolecular interactions (such as hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking, metal coordination, and hydrophobic effects) not only provide a preorganized environment for rearrangement reactions, lowering the reaction energy barrier, but also guide the reaction pathway through spatial constraints and electronic effects, enabling precise control at higher levels of assembly.</p>
            
            <h4>Case Study 1: Regulation of Pinacol Rearrangement in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)</h4>
            <p>Researchers integrated symmetric pinacol units as linkers into a Zn⁴⁺-based MOF. Under solid-state conditions, the pore constraints of the MOF and the Lewis acidity of the metal nodes significantly reduced the rearrangement energy barrier and guided the migration direction of the carbocation, resulting in over 98% regioselectivity for the rearrangement product. This process caused the MOF framework to transform from an open porous structure to a dense interpenetrated structure, enabling dynamic modulation of pore size and gas adsorption capacity. This study demonstrates how high selectivity in rearrangement reactions can be achieved through the supramolecular environment, thereby driving the switching of macroscopic material properties.</p>
            
            <h4>Case Study 2: Cope Rearrangement-Triggered Depolymerization-Reassembly Cycle in Supramolecular Polymers</h4>
            <p>In a class of supramolecular systems based on coordination polymers, 1,5-diene units were organized into linear chain structures via metal coordination (e.g., PtⅡ or ZnⅡ). Upon UV irradiation, the Cope rearrangement was triggered, causing a sigmatropic shift and transforming the molecular topology from chain-like to ring-like structures, leading to the disintegration of the supramolecular polymer. This process could be reversed by heating, enabling reversible switching between polymerized and depolymerized states of the material, providing a new approach for designing light-controlled release or adaptive soft materials.</p>

            <h3>III. Cutting-Edge Application Examples: Innovative Realization of Smart Materials and Information Storage</h3>
            
            <h4>1. Claisen Rearrangement Mechanism in Self-Healing Coating Materials</h4>
            <p>The Claisen rearrangement has been successfully applied to design self-healing polymer coatings. By embedding allyl vinyl ether as a dynamic unit into the polyurethane backbone, localized heating triggers the Claisen rearrangement, generating polar carbonyl groups and inducing chain segment movement, effectively repairing microcracks. By tuning the rearrangement temperature and polymer chain mobility, highly efficient (healing efficiency >90%), multi-trigger self-healing behavior can be achieved, suitable for aerospace coatings and electronic packaging materials.</p>
            
            <h4>2. Dynamic Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) for Molecular Information Storage</h4>
            <p>The pinacol rearrangement was used to construct reconfigurable two-dimensional COF structures. By applying localized acidic stimulus via scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), the rearrangement reaction could be triggered in micro-regions, altering the polarity and conjugation properties of the nodes, thereby significantly affecting the material's fluorescence and conductive properties. Utilizing these stimulus-response differences, binary information encoding ("0" and "1") could be achieved within the COF thin film, and read-out and erasure were performed via fluorescence microscopy, with information retention lasting for months, demonstrating its potential application in high-density molecular storage devices.</p>

            <h3>IV. Future Challenges and Development Directions</h3>
            <p>The field is still in its developmental stage, with many key questions awaiting further exploration:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Spatiotemporal Control Precision</strong>: There is a need to develop stimulation methods with high spatiotemporal resolution (e.g., femtosecond lasers, electrochemical microprobes) to achieve timed and targeted control of rearrangement reactions within complex material environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulation Mechanisms for Competitive Rearrangement Pathways</strong>: The same molecule might undergo different rearrangement pathways (e.g., Pinacol vs. Semipinacol) in different supramolecular environments. Combining theoretical calculations with in situ characterization is required to reveal the physical organic mechanisms of the template effect.</li>
                <li><strong>Innovation in In Situ and Operando Characterization Techniques</strong>: Rearrangement reaction intermediates (e.g., carbocations, diradicals) have short lifetimes and low concentrations. There is an urgent need to develop time-resolved spectroscopy, low-temperature solid-state NMR, in situ atomic force microscopy, and other techniques to capture the synergistic process of assembly and rearrangement in real-time.</li>
                <li><strong>Biocompatibility and Environmental Adaptability</strong>: When applying rearrangement reaction-regulated assembly systems in biomaterials or environments, the compatibility of reaction conditions with biological systems must be considered, such as developing rearrangement systems reversible under physiological temperature or pH.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>As an emerging branch of dynamic covalent chemistry, rearrangement reactions are significantly expanding the design dimensions and application boundaries of supramolecular precision assembly. Their inherent structural reconfiguration capabilities and stimulus-responsive characteristics provide a powerful driving force for creating next-generation smart materials—including self-healing systems, reconfigurable nanodevices, and adaptive interfaces. With the ongoing integration of multi-scale theoretical simulations, advanced characterization techniques, and novel reaction design, rearrangement reaction-guided supramolecular assembly holds promise for opening up broader research prospects in materials science, synthetic biology, and information storage.</p>
