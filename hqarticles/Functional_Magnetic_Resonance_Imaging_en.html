        <section>
            <p>When we attempt to glimpse the ultimate mysteries of human thought through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a lurking assumption is often overlooked: are we merely searching for a "standard brain" pre-defined by a specific culture? Beneath the dazzling prospects of fMRI technology globalization, a subtle yet powerful power structure is taking shape. It operates not through military conquest, but quietly constructs the order of global neuroscience through data standards, cognitive models, and equipment supply chains. This compels us to question: when brain activity patterns from the non-Western world are examined under a Western-centric academic framework, are we witnessing the rise of "brain network colonialism"?</p>

            <h3>1. The fMRI "Standard Brain" Myth: The Dominance of WEIRD Samples</h3>
            <p>There is an open secret in neuroscience: its conclusions heavily rely on a specific population – the WEIRD group, i.e., individuals from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic societies. An analysis of 500 fMRI research papers published in *Nature* over the past decade (2013-2023) revealed that over 85% of subjects came from North America and Europe. In contrast, Asia, representing over 60% of the world's population, contributed to less than 10% of study subjects, while Africa and South America appear as near "blank spots on the neuroscience map" (Smith & Patel, 2022).</p>
            
            <p>This sample imbalance directly leads to bias in theory construction. The most classic case is the study of the neural representation of the "self." For a long time, the Default Mode Network (DMN) in the brain has been considered the core hub for "self-referential thinking," with its activation level closely related to the inward focus and independent thinking emphasized in individualistic cultures. However, when researchers turned their attention to East Asian societies, intriguing differences were found. For instance, a study from Tsinghua University found that when completing tasks involving evaluating their mothers, Chinese subjects showed a highly overlapping DMN activation pattern with that observed during self-evaluation, whereas Western subjects exhibited a clear distinction (Li et al., 2021). This provides neural-level evidence for the close cognitive integration of the "self" and "significant others" in East Asian collectivist cultures.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The counter-intuitive insight is:</strong> The function of the Default Mode Network, often hailed as the "brain's background noise," may not be a universal "self-centric" process but is, to a large extent, "written" by cultural scripts. The dominance of WEIRD samples unintentionally elevates a culturally specific mode of thinking to a neural standard for all humanity, making non-individualistic cognitive patterns appear "abnormal" or "atypical" by comparison. This raises a fundamental controversy: <strong>If the baseline for the so-called "standard brain" is itself established based on the characteristics of a small fraction of the global population, how meaningful is its representativeness for all of humanity?</strong></p>

            <h3>2. The Neural Boundaries of Language and Thought: Cultural Differences Solidified by Technology</h3>
            <p>Language is the vessel of thought, and fMRI technology attempts to capture the specific tracks of this vessel in the brain. However, the technology itself is not culturally neutral. The dominant cognitive paradigms and analysis software are mostly developed based on processing models for alphabetic languages (like English), posing deep challenges for studying paratactic languages like Chinese.</p>
            
            <p>Comparative studies show significant differences in brain region activation patterns between native English and Chinese speakers when processing metaphors. English metaphor comprehension relies more heavily on traditional language areas like the left inferior frontal gyrus, whereas Chinese metaphors elicit more widespread collaboration in the right hemisphere and brain regions related to visuospatial processing (Wang et al., 2023). This might suggest that the paratactic thinking in Chinese, where "meaning is derived from the character's appearance," mobilizes more holistic, imagery-based cognitive resources.</p>
            
            <p>However, <strong>can fMRI truly capture the characteristics of Chinese "paratactic" thinking?</strong> This is a sharp techno-philosophical question. Current fMRI analysis typically relies on a "localization" logic, attempting to pin complex higher-order thinking to one or several specific brain regions. But the holistic and ambiguous nature of Chinese thinking, encapsulated in the phrase "writing cannot fully express speech, and speech cannot fully express meaning," might inherently resist such simplistic spatial pinpointing. Are we using a technological tool that pursues "precision" and "segmentation" to forcibly measure a cognitive system that崇尚"holism" and "connection," thus inevitably causing loss and distortion of information? This mismatch between the technological paradigm and the cultural core leads to the further marginalization of non-Western cognitive modes within neuroscientific discourse.</p>

            <h3>3. Power Structures in Technology Transfer: From Instrument Export to Paradigm Dumping</h3>
            <p>The power structure of "brain network colonialism" is rooted in tangible hardware and technology transfer. The global high-end fMRI equipment market is dominated by three giants: Siemens, General Electric (GE), and Philips. They not only sell equipment but also bundle an entire operating system, analysis software, and "standard operating procedures" based on Western research paradigms.</p>
            
            <p>When a brand-new fMRI scanner arrives from Germany or the USA at a new laboratory in Africa or South Asia, it comes with a set of invisible cultural baggage. Researchers in developing countries often need training from suppliers or Western collaborating institutions, learning to use algorithm models pre-trained on WEIRD data. This creates a cycle: to publish papers in top international journals, they must adopt Western-dominated research questions, experimental designs, and interpretative frameworks, thereby continuously replicating and reinforcing the existing knowledge hegemony.</p>
            
            <p>An enlightening case comes from Africa. A local consulting company attempted neuromarketing research to understand local consumer decision-making mechanisms. They found that the Western classical "rational choice model" failed to explain many local consumer behaviors. For instance, the influence of community relationships and clan sentiments on purchasing decisions far exceeded individual preferences and cost-benefit calculations. When they tried to validate this finding using fMRI, they struggled to find suitable analysis tools to quantify these social brain activities because mainstream neuroeconomic models had not allocated space for these variables (Adeyemi, 2022). This case reveals the essence of "paradigm dumping": it is not just the export of technology but also the implantation of a specific mindset, making innovative research based on local cultures difficult to gain a voice.</p>

            <h3>4. Paths to Resolution: Participatory Neuroscience and Decolonized Databases</h3>
            <p>Faced with this dilemma, the global neuroscience community is awakening and actively exploring paths to resolution. Emerging organizations like the "Global Neurodiversity Coalition" strongly advocate for and promote the establishment of more inclusive neuroimaging databases. Their core concept is "participatory neuroscience," meaning that researchers and communities from different cultural backgrounds participate from the outset in research design, data interpretation, and knowledge production, rather than merely acting as passive data providers.</p>
            
            <p>On the technical front, efforts towards decolonized databases have also spurred new ideas. <strong>Could a blockchain-based distributed fMRI data sharing model break the hegemony?</strong> This concept aims to create a decentralized global data network. Local laboratories can collect data according to unified but locally adapted standards, then upload it encrypted and anonymously to a blockchain network. Researchers can access this data after authorization, but the original ownership and control rights of the data remain with the collecting party. This model not only protects data privacy and sovereignty but also fosters truly diverse, bottom-up theory generation, instead of relying on "beneficent" secondary data analysis by a few Western data centers.</p>
            
            <p>Looking ahead, breakthrough innovations in neuroscience will likely stem from in-depth studies of non-Western cognitive traditions. For example, research on the brain networks involved in Buddhist meditation, yoga, and other millennia-old mental training practices is beginning to challenge our固有 understanding of attention, self-awareness, and emotional regulation. These practices originating in the East might provide new frameworks for understanding brain plasticity and the nature of consciousness, thereby liberating neuroscience from the narrow confines of WEIRD samples and advancing towards a truly universal "human brain science."</p>

            <h3>Summary of Key Challenges for the Next Decade</h3>
            <p>The core challenge for the next decade lies in deconstructing the deeply ingrained cultural and power structures within fMRI technology. The key is achieving three major shifts: from WEIRD sample monopoly to truly global neurodiversity databases; from technological paradigm dumping to bidirectional knowledge exchange that encourages localized paradigm innovation; from hardware dependency to open-source, transparent algorithms and data-sharing models. Success will determine whether the "human brain map" we draw is a true reflection of diverse civilizations or just another form of cultural hegemony.</p>
