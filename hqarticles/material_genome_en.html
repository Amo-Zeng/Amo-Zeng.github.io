            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Throughout the history of scientific research, analogical thinking has always been an essential tool for expanding the frontiers of knowledge. In recent years, the concept of the "Materials Genome" (Materials Genome Initiative, MGI) has gradually gained traction, borrowing from the successful experience of biological genomics to accelerate the development of materials science through similar frameworks and methodologies.</p>

            <h2>Analogical Research Methods</h2>
            <h3>Methodology of Biological Genomics</h3>
            <p>The success of biological genomics is inseparable from its systematic research methods. First, the advancement of gene sequencing technology allows scientists to quickly and accurately obtain genetic information from organisms. Subsequently, by analyzing genomic data, researchers can reveal the relationships between genes and traits, enabling precise control of biological organisms.</p>
            <h3>Adaptation in Materials Genomics</h3>
            <p>Materials genomics adapts the methodologies of biological genomics, aiming to accelerate materials discovery and optimization through similar pathways. First, materials genomics relies on high-throughput computational and experimental techniques to rapidly generate and screen large volumes of materials data.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical Framework Construction</h2>
            <h3>Theoretical Basis of Biological Genomics</h3>
            <p>The theoretical framework of biological genomics is built upon Darwin's theory of evolution and molecular biology. Genes are the basic units of life information, and through gene mutation, selection, and inheritance, organisms evolve and adapt to their environments.</p>
            <h3>Theoretical Extension in Materials Genomics</h3>
            <p>The theoretical framework of materials genomics is rooted in material science and computer science. The core concept of materials genomics is to treat the composition, structure, and properties of materials as an integrated whole, revealing the intrinsic laws of material performance through systematic data analysis and model construction.</p>

            <h2>Integration of Materials Genome and Sustainability</h2>
            <h3>High Performance, Low Cost: The Future of Green Materials</h3>
            <p>Traditional material development often relies on trial-and-error methods, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly. Materials genomics, by integrating big data, artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing, can quickly predict material properties and screen optimal formulations, significantly shortening the material development cycle and reducing costs.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The analogy between "Materials Genome" and "Biological Genome" not only helps us understand the complexity of materials science but also provides valuable experience and insights for the development of materials genomics. Future advancements must focus on technological innovation while emphasizing the establishment of ethical guidelines and data governance to ensure that the integration of materials genomics and artificial intelligence truly benefits human society.</p>
