Hmm, the user only entered the two characters "数甲" (shǔ jiǎ), which provides very little information. I need to infer their intent. They might be a student or parent wanting to learn about high school math competitions, or it could be an input error where they meant to type something else.  

Considering that "数甲" is a colloquial term for math competitions, but the naming varies by region: In Shanghai, the "High School Math Competition" is commonly called "数甲," while the national league is called "高联" (Gāo Lián), and the Chinese Mathematical Olympiad is CMO. The user might be looking for competition rules, study materials, or might have mistaken it for a textbook name.  

I’ll respond with information about math competitions first, covering the most likely interpretation. If the user has a more specific intent—for example, asking about textbook versions (e.g., the "人教版数学必修甲种本")—I can supplement the explanation later. The response should use phrases like "usually refers to" to leave room for adjustment and avoid being overly assertive.  

The user didn’t use punctuation, which might indicate quick mobile input. The reply should be structured but not overly verbose, focusing on three key points: the competition system, preparation advice, and resource channels. Finally, I should prompt the user to clarify if needed—since someone who only types two characters might not want to type much more.

"数甲" (shǔ jiǎ) typically refers to **high school math competitions**, particularly **provincial/city-level contests** within the Chinese Mathematical Olympiad (CMO) selection system (e.g., a common term in Shanghai). Here’s a detailed breakdown:  

---  

### **1. What is 数甲?**  
- **Purpose**: An advanced stage of high school math competitions, often referring to **provincial or city-level elite contests**. It serves as a key step to qualify for the National High School Math League (高联) and higher-tier competitions (e.g., CMO, IMO).  
- **Regional usage**: Some regions like Shanghai) use "数甲" for their local competitions, while others may call it "preliminary league rounds."  

---  

### **2. Competition Hierarchy**  
The standard progression in China:  
1. **School selection** → **City/provincial preliminaries** (e.g., "数甲") →  
2. **National High School Math League (高联)** (awards: Provincial Tier 1/2/3) →  
3. **Chinese Mathematical Olympiad (CMO)** (national camp) →  
4. **International Math Olympiad (IMO)** (team selection).  

---  

### **3. Exam Content**  
- **Scope**:  
  Beyond standard curriculum, covering:  
  - Algebra (inequalities, sequences, polynomials)  
  - Geometry (power of a point, projective methods, complex numbers)  
  - Number theory (modular arithmetic, Fermat’s Little Theorem)  
  - Combinatorics (graph theory, counting).  
- **Format**: **Proof-based problems**, emphasizing logic and creative techniques.  

---  

### **4. How to Prepare?**  
- **Foundation**:  
  Master all high school math + advanced topics (e.g., *Olympiad Tutorials* series).  
- **Specialized training**:  
  Focus on modules (geometry, number theory, etc.). Recommended: *Mathematical Olympiad Lecture Series*.  
- **Past papers**:  
  Practice 10+ years of provincial/national problems (e.g., "数甲," 高联).  
- **Mock tests**:  
  Timed simulations to improve speed and strategy.  

---  

### **5. Recommended Resources**  
- **Books**:  
  - *High School Math Competition Training Guides* (Level 1/2)  
  - *Olympiad Classics* (topic-specific)  
- **Websites**:  
  - IMO China Official Site  
  - Online courses (e.g., Aijianzi, Yuanfudao)  
- **Updates**:  
  Follow **China Mathematical Society** or local math association notices.  

---  

### **6. Other Possible Meanings**  
- **Rare cases**: "数甲" might refer to **textbook editions** (e.g., "甲种本" for advanced tracks), but the context here favors competitions.  
- **Clarify**: If you meant something else (e.g., textbooks, specific regions), feel free to add details!  

If your goal is **competition prep** or **understanding the process**, ask further! Need sample problems or study plans? Just let me know 😊
