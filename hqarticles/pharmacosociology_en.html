            <h2>The Rise of Medication Social Networks</h2>
            <p>The rise of medication social networks is largely attributed to the popularity of social media. Platforms like WeChat, Facebook, and Instagram provide convenient channels for communication. For individuals with chronic or rare diseases, finding like-minded peers and sharing medication experiences offers immense psychological comfort and practical help. The information sharing within patient groups often provides personalized advice and emotional support that doctors and pharmacists may not be able to offer.</p>
            <p>However, this information sharing also comes with potential risks. Given the rapid spread of information on social media, unverified medication experiences or folk remedies can quickly proliferate, leading patients to blindly follow suit without professional medical guidance. In such cases, the positive aspects of medication social networks may be overshadowed by their potential negative impacts.</p>

            <h2>Procurement Platforms and Drug Transactions</h2>
            <p>With the rise of cross-border e-commerce, procurement platforms have become another crucial element in medication social networks. Many patients purchase prescription drugs from abroad through these platforms, as these medications may be difficult to obtain or expensive domestically. The convenience and relatively low cost of procurement platforms have led to an increasing number of people opting for this method to acquire medications.</p>
            <p>However, purchasing drugs through procurement carries numerous risks. Firstly, the quality and safety of the medications cannot be guaranteed, as many are not subject to formal import approval procedures. Secondly, without professional medical guidance, patients may misuse medications, leading to severe health issues. Additionally, the legality of purchasing drugs in this manner is questionable, with many countries and regions taking a stern stance on such transactions.</p>

            <h2>Social Media and "Medicated Cosmetics" Promotion</h2>
            <p>In addition to prescription drugs, the promotion of "medicated cosmetics" on social media is another significant component of medication social networks. As interest in beauty and skincare continues to grow, an increasing number of "medicated cosmetics" products are being promoted through social media. These products often claim to have medical-grade effects, capable of addressing various skin issues.</p>
            <p>However, the promotion of "medicated cosmetics" also poses several problems. Firstly, many products have not undergone rigorous medical validation, and their efficacy and safety cannot be guaranteed. Secondly, the promotion on social media often lacks transparency, making it difficult for consumers to assess the authenticity and effectiveness of the products. Furthermore, some promotional activities may involve false advertising and fraud, leading to financial losses and health risks for consumers.</p>

            <h2>Sociological Analysis of Medication Emotional Labor</h2>
            <p>In modern society, the use of medications has long since transcended the realm of mere physiological treatment, gradually becoming a tool to meet people's emotional needs and social expectations. This phenomenon is referred to as "medication emotional labor," which not only involves the physiological effects of drugs but also delves into how medications function on an emotional level to fulfill people's deep psychological needs and social role expectations.</p>
            <p>As a physical entity, the most direct function of medications is to treat diseases and alleviate symptoms. However, with societal development and people's pursuit of quality of life, the use of medications has gradually surpassed the scope of physiological needs, starting to serve emotional needs as well. For instance, parents giving their children so-called "smart drugs" are not merely aiming to enhance their child's intelligence but also to fulfill their own expectations of the child's academic success and to alleviate their own anxiety as parents. Similarly, couples taking "aphrodisiacs" are not just seeking to enhance physiological desires but also to strengthen their relationship, maintain stability, and fulfill each other's emotional expectations.</p>

            <h2>The Multifaceted Roles of Medication Emotional Labor</h2>
            <p>The multifaceted roles that medications play in modern society make them a complex tool for emotional labor. Firstly, medications can act as emotional regulators, helping individuals cope with emotional fluctuations and social pressures. For example, antidepressants not only alleviate depressive symptoms but also help individuals regain normal emotional states, allowing them to reintegrate into social life. Secondly, medications can serve as intermediaries for social expectations, helping individuals meet others' emotional needs and expectations. For instance, giving elderly individuals "anti-aging medications" is not just about prolonging life but also about fulfilling societal expectations.</p>
