            <h2>Dual Impact of Guerrilla Tactics in Modern Conflicts: Morality, Culture, and the Future</h2>
            <p>In the contemporary world of globalization and multipolarity, the forms of warfare and the interactions between nations are undergoing profound transformations. Guerrilla tactics, an ancient yet vibrant mode of combat, are increasingly important in modern conflicts due to their unique flexibility, concealment, and asymmetry. However, the application of guerrilla tactics not only brings tactical advantages but also raises a series of moral and cultural dilemmas, profoundly affecting international security and global governance.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>The Rise of Guerrilla Tactics and Asymmetry in Modern Conflicts</h3>
            <p>The core of guerrilla tactics lies in utilizing the asymmetry of terrain, time, and information to conduct continuous and low-intensity strikes against the enemy. Against the backdrop of cyber warfare and information warfare, this ancient tactic has been organically integrated with emerging forms of combat. For example, by using cyber attacks to paralyze the enemy's critical infrastructure, guerrilla forces can inflict significant damage on the enemy without exposing their own positions. Additionally, the widespread application of social media and information dissemination enables guerrilla forces to rapidly mobilize public opinion and enhance their combat capabilities.</p>
            <p>In a multipolar world, non-state actors such as terrorist organizations and civilian armed forces are using guerrilla tactics to confront superpowers. These actors are often unbound by national sovereignty, quickly adapt to environmental changes, and operate flexibly on a global scale. For instance, ISIS combined guerrilla tactics with information warfare, not only causing severe damage in the Middle East but also triggering global terrorist attacks, challenging traditional military powers of major countries.</p>

            <h3>Moral Dilemmas of Guerrilla Tactics and Protection of Cultural Heritage</h3>
            <p>Although guerrilla tactics demonstrate formidable combat capabilities in modern conflicts, their application also raises profound moral dilemmas. Guerrilla forces often hide among civilians, using their support and cover for their operations, making it difficult for the enemy to distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, thereby increasing the risk to civilians in conflicts. Moreover, guerrilla tactics, such as assassination, sabotage, and ambushes, while tactically effective, are morally difficult to justify. These methods often result in civilian casualties, placing guerrilla forces in a moral dilemma in their pursuit of justice and peace.</p>
            <p>Simultaneously, the application of guerrilla tactics has caused profound damage to cultural heritage. Under the shadow of war and conflict, these precious heritages often become innocent victims. Guerrilla activities not only pose a threat to the enemy but also cause incalculable losses to cultural heritage. For example, during the Syrian civil war, the ancient city of Aleppo's architectural heritage suffered severe destruction, with guerrilla activity being a significant factor. This destruction is not only a material loss but also an erasure of historical memory, making it difficult for future generations to trace and understand the threads of civilization.</p>
            <p>However, guerrilla forces may sometimes protect or utilize cultural heritage out of patriotic sentiments or political propaganda purposes. For example, during World War II, French resistance fighters often held secret meetings and activities in cultural heritage sites, which not only became symbols of their resistance but also places to inspire patriotic sentiment among the populace. This utilization often comes with risks; once a cultural heritage site is attacked, the loss is not only material but also spiritual. Therefore, finding a balance between utilization and protection is a complex and delicate issue.</p>

            <h3>International Cooperation and Future Outlook</h3>
            <p>In the face of the moral and cultural dilemmas brought by guerrilla tactics, the international community must seek innovative solutions to address this new security environment. Firstly, the protection efforts of international organizations and individuals in war zones are crucial. Institutions such as UNESCO and the ICRC, through communication with belligerent parties, the establishment of protected areas, and emergency repair work, strive to mitigate the destruction of cultural heritage by war. However, these efforts are often constrained by guerrilla forces, so establishing effective communication mechanisms to ensure the smooth progress of international protection actions is key to protecting cultural heritage.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the international community needs to enhance cooperation to collectively address the challenges posed by non-state actors. This requires not only cooperation between nations but also dialogue and coordination with non-state actors to seek more effective solutions. Additionally, the international community should promote the reform of the global governance system to adapt to the new security environment and ensure global security and stability.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In the context of globalization and multipolarity, guerrilla tactics are increasingly becoming an important force in modern conflicts. By integrating with emerging forms of combat such as cyber warfare and information warfare, guerrilla tactics not only challenge traditional military powers but also have a profound impact on the international security architecture and global governance. However, the application of guerrilla tactics also raises a series of moral and cultural dilemmas, causing profound damage to civilians and cultural heritage. Facing this new security environment, the international community must seek innovative solutions to address the challenges brought by guerrilla tactics and ensure global security and stability.</p>
