            <h2>Integration of Ancient Formulas with Modern Technology: The Innovative Path and Vast Prospects of TCM Modernization</h2>
            <p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), as a treasure of the Chinese nation, has a history of thousands of years. Its core concept of "identifying conditions and determining treatments" and its rich clinical experience provide unique solutions to human health. However, with the rapid development of modern medicine, traditional TCM faces significant challenges in how to integrate with the modern medical system and achieve precise treatment. In recent years, combining ancient formulas with modern biomedical models and modern pharmaceutical technologies has led to significant progress in TCM modernization, particularly in personalized treatment, medical aesthetics, skin disease treatment, and the development of new drug delivery systems, showcasing vast applications. </p>

            <h3>1. Integration of Ancient Formulas with Modern Biomedical Models: Scientific Exploration and Realization of Personalized Treatment</h3>
            <p>Traditional TCM emphasizes "treating the same disease differently" and "treating different diseases the same way", but its empirical treatment methods often struggle to achieve precise treatment when faced with complex diseases and individual differences. Modern biomedical models, such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, provide new scientific tools for formula research. These technologies allow for a deeper understanding of the mechanism of action of formulas, providing scientific evidence for precise treatment.</p>
            <p>For example, genomics can screen components of formulas targeting specific gene mutations, thereby developing personalized treatment plans for diseases related to gene mutations. For cancer, different patients may carry different oncogenic mutations, and traditional chemotherapy drugs often lack specificity. Through modern biomedical models, components of formulas targeting specific gene mutations can be screened, developing more targeted treatment plans, improving treatment efficacy, and reducing side effects.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the concept of personalized treatment has been widely applied in medical aesthetics and skin disease treatment. By analyzing the gut microbiota, skin microecology, or genetic characteristics of patients, personalized topical formula treatments can be tailored. For instance, for patients with sensitive skin, anti-inflammatory and soothing formulas can be chosen; for patients with significant pigmentation, formulas with whitening and brightening effects can be selected. This precise treatment approach not only improves efficacy but also reduces adverse reactions, opening new avenues for TCM in modern medicine.</p>

            <h3>2. Topical Application of Formulas: Pioneering New Fields in Medical Aesthetics and Skin Disease Treatment</h3>
            <p>Topical application of formulas is an important method of TCM treatment, characterized by quick results, few side effects, and easy operation. In recent years, with the development of modern technology, topical formula application has gradually become a hotspot in medical aesthetics and skin disease treatment.</p>
            <p>In the field of medical aesthetics, classical formulas like "Yu Rong San" (Jade Beauty Powder) are widely used for their whitening and freckle-removing effects. Modern research has confirmed that its main components, such as Angelica Dahurica and Atractylodes Macrocephala, have antioxidant and melanin-inhibiting properties, effectively improving skin pigmentation. Similarly, topical formulas like "Qing Dai San" (Indigo Powder) have shown significant effects in treating skin diseases such as eczema and acne, with their anti-inflammatory and antibacterial mechanisms validated by modern pharmacology.</p>
            <p>Modern biomedical models provide scientific support for topical formula research. For example, through skin penetration models, the absorption and distribution of formula components in the skin can be studied, optimizing the combination proportion and dosage form of formulas. Research has found that some formula components, after nano-processing, can significantly improve their permeability, thus enhancing treatment effects. Additionally, cell experimental models can screen components with specific biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and repair-promoting effects, providing scientific basis for clinical application.</p>

            <h3>3. Combination of Formulas with Modern Pharmaceutical Technologies: Developing New Drug Delivery Systems</h3>
            <p>Traditional TCM formulas are mostly oral decoctions, facing issues such as unstable drug absorption and difficult precise control of efficacy. Modern pharmaceutical technologies, such as nanotechnology, microemulsion technology, liposome technology, and controlled-release technology, provide new solutions for formula modernization.</p>
            <p>Nanotechnology, by encapsulating drugs in nano-carriers, significantly enhances drug targeting and absorption. For example, anti-cancer TCM components like ginsenosides and paclitaxel derivatives can be targeted to tumor cells through nanotechnology, reducing toxicity to normal cells. Similarly, nanotechnology can improve the solubility and stability of TCM components, enhancing treatment effects.</p>
            <p>Microemulsion and liposome technologies are mainly used for optimizing topical formulas, such as "Qing Dai San" for treating skin diseases, can be formulated into topical preparations using microemulsion technology, improving drug permeability and absorption in the skin. Liposome technology, by mimicking cell membrane structures, enhances drug targeting and biocompatibility, providing new options for skin disease treatment.</p>
            <p>Controlled-release technology extends the drug's action time in the body, reducing dosing frequency and improving patient compliance. For example, formula "Liu Wei Di Huang Wan" (Six-Ingredient Rehmannia Pill) for treating chronic diseases can be formulated into oral preparations using controlled-release technology, achieving long-term drug release, thereby continuously improving patient symptoms.</p>

            <h3>4. Challenges and Outlook: The Road to TCM Modernization is Long</h3>
            <p>Although the integration of formulas with modern technology has shown vast application prospects, it still faces challenges in practical application. For instance, how to establish standardized, reproducible formula research methods, how to effectively combine multi-omics data with TCM theory, and how to translate research results into clinical applications.</p>
            <p>In the future, it is necessary to further strengthen interdisciplinary collaboration, integrating the strengths of TCM, modern medicine, and bioinformatics, to build a comprehensive formula research system. Meanwhile, policy support and international cooperation are also important guarantees for promoting TCM modernization. Only through joint efforts can TCM play a greater role in the modern medical system.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The integration of formulas with modern technology provides new opportunities for TCM modernization. Through scientific exploration and the application of innovative technologies, not only can the mechanisms of action of formulas be better understood, but personalized treatment and precision medicine can also be achieved, promoting the broad application of TCM in modern medicine. With deeper research and technological advancements, TCM will regain vitality in the modern medical system, contributing to human health and beauty.</p>
