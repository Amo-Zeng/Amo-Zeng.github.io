**"Mathematics A" (Shu Jia)** typically refers to the **Mathematics A subject** in the **Taiwanese university entrance examinations** (the Academic Ability Test and the Advanced Subjects Test, now replaced by the Subject Competency Test).  

### Key Information about "Mathematics A":  

1. **Positioning:**  
   - **Advanced and theoretical:** Mathematics A is designed for students aiming to enter **science, engineering, medicine, agriculture, and other fields requiring strong mathematical skills** (e.g., mathematics, physics, electrical engineering, computer science, medicine, etc.).  
   - **Higher difficulty:** Compared to "Mathematics B" (Shu Yi), Mathematics A covers a broader range of topics, delves deeper into concepts, features more complex problems, and requires stronger logical reasoning and computational skills.  
   - **Highly selective:** Scores in Mathematics A are a crucial criterion for admission to top universities' competitive STEM programs.  

2. **Exam Scope (general outline, subject to the official syllabus):**  
   - **Core higher mathematics topics:**  
     - Vectors  
     - Planes and lines in space  
     - Matrices  
     - Quadratic curves (conic sections: ellipses, hyperbolas, parabolas)  
     - **Calculus (key focus):** Limits, continuity, derivatives (differentiation) and applications (tangent lines, rates of change, extrema, curve sketching), **integrals** and applications (area, volume, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus)  
   - **Advanced high school mathematics:**  
     - Exponential and logarithmic functions (including the natural logarithm, **ln**)  
     - Trigonometric functions and their applications  
     - Discrete mathematics (sequences, series, mathematical induction, combinatorics, binomial theorem, probability, and basic statistics)  
   - **Skills emphasized:** Abstract thinking, logical reasoning, problem-solving, and complex calculations.  

3. **Comparison with Other Math Exams:**  
   - **Mathematics B (Shu Yi):** Covers a narrower range with lower difficulty, focusing on functions (especially polynomial, exponential, and logarithmic functions), combinatorics, probability, and statistics. It is intended for social sciences, business, and design programs.  
   - **Academic Ability Test (Xue Ce) Math:** A general assessment with multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions, covering core high school math concepts. Its difficulty is between Mathematics A and B (closer to B).  

4. **Target Test-Takers:**  
   - Students aiming for **top-tier STEM, computer science, or medical programs** must take Mathematics A.  
   - Universities specify whether they require "Mathematics A" scores for admission.  

5. **Importance:**  
   - For students targeting competitive STEM or medical fields, Mathematics A is a **critical gatekeeper** that significantly impacts admission results.  

### Summary:  
"Mathematics A" is the **most advanced and calculus-intensive math subject** in Taiwan's university entrance exams, primarily for **STEM and medical programs**. It serves as a key screening tool for top universities.  

### Recommendations for Students:  
- **Confirm the subject requirements** of your target programs (whether they require Mathematics A or B).  
- **Thoroughly review the exam syllabus** and content.  
- **Use study materials specifically designed for Mathematics A.**  
- **Practice extensively**, especially with past exam papers and mock tests.  
- **Build a solid foundation** in calculus, vectors, matrices, and conic sections.  
- **Improve speed and accuracy** in problem-solving.
