            <h2>The Future of Distributed Energy</h2>
            <p>As global energy demand continues to rise and environmental issues become increasingly prominent, distributed energy resources (DERs) have emerged as a critical driver for the transformation and upgrading of the energy industry. With their flexibility, efficiency, and sustainability, distributed energy is gradually reshaping traditional energy production and consumption models. However, its complexity and decentralization also present new challenges for system management and optimization. In this context, the deep integration of cutting-edge technologies such as the metaverse, blockchain, and artificial intelligence (AI) offers revolutionary solutions for the intelligent, decentralized, and efficient management of distributed energy systems.</p>
