            <p>In the context of high-quality economic development in China's new era, mixed ownership reform has transcended the traditional scope of corporate governance optimization, with its deeper value increasingly prominent. As a key link between the state and the market, mixed ownership is evolving into a comprehensive institutional tool, not only reshaping social trust mechanisms but also undertaking multiple functions such as serving as a testing ground for institutional innovation and exploring the path of social value enterprise. It is gradually becoming a core institutional pivot for promoting the modernization of the national governance system and fostering the coordinated development of social equity and efficiency.</p>

            <h2>1. Reshaping Trust Mechanisms: Building Government-Enterprise Collaboration and Market Confidence</h2>
            <p>In a market economy, trust is the "invisible capital" of resource allocation and social cooperation. Traditionally, people tend to have "institutional trust" in state-owned enterprises and value "market efficiency" in private enterprises. Mixed ownership aptly combines the advantages of both: by introducing a diversified capital structure, it forms a multi-party game and supervision mechanism, forcing governance transparency, thereby alleviating information asymmetry and enhancing public confidence.</p>
            <p>For example, the involvement of private capital has led state-owned enterprises to abandon "paternalistic" management styles, while the stable background of state-owned capital has enhanced the sustainability of private enterprises. In this process, the construction of trust no longer relies on the credit of a single entity but forms an institutionalized trust system through clear equity structures, governance rules, and profit distribution mechanisms.</p>
            <p>However, the realization of this goal depends on the maturity of the institutional environment. Lagging laws, policies, and regulations may lead to mixed ownership reform being superficial or even exacerbating conflicts of interest. Therefore, the future requires strengthening the standardization of institutional design and promoting deep government-enterprise collaboration in key areas such as infrastructure and green energy, making mixed ownership enterprises dual hubs for policy execution and market vitality.</p>

            <h2>2. Fertile Ground for Institutional Innovation: Promoting Compatibility and Reform Pilot Exploration</h2>
            <p>The profound significance of mixed ownership reform is not limited to the operational level of enterprises but also lies in its function as a "buffer zone" and "testing ground" for institutional innovation. It provides a testing space for the compatibility and integration of different ownership rules, driving deep innovation in personnel, compensation, governance, and other systems. For example, in areas such as employee stock ownership plans, professional manager systems, and property rights transfer mechanisms, mixed ownership enterprises often exhibit greater flexibility, becoming the preferred platform for policy pilots.</p>
            <p>However, current pilot policies still face challenges such as institutional conflicts, policy distortions, and inadequate incentive mechanisms in local implementation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to promote <strong>institutional integration innovation</strong>, providing more institutional support in areas such as taxation, regulation, and equity incentives, while leveraging digital technologies (such as blockchain and big data) to enhance governance transparency and policy traceability, truly realizing "technology empowering institutions."</p>
            <p>This path not only helps improve the competitiveness of mixed ownership enterprises but also provides a practical sample and institutional path for broader institutional reforms in the future.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>3. Reconstructing Social Value: Promoting "Social Value Enterprise"</h2>
            <p>Against the dual backdrop of the accelerated implementation of global ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) concepts and China's common prosperity goals, enterprises are facing a historic opportunity to shift from solely pursuing profits to creating multiple values. Mixed ownership, with its combination of state-owned enterprise responsibility awareness and market efficiency advantages, has become a natural carrier for promoting the realization of social value.</p>
            <p>For example, in areas such as rural revitalization, ecological environmental protection, and public services, mixed ownership enterprises can integrate resources to achieve a win-win situation of economic and social benefits. In this process, it is necessary to clarify the social goals and profit boundaries of enterprises through institutional design to prevent "social responsibility drift" or "economic goal neglect."</p>
            <p>In the future, we should explore <strong>social value-oriented mixed ownership models</strong>, embedding social return goals into corporate governance mechanisms, and establishing scientific and diversified social value evaluation systems. On this basis, we should promote the formation of a <strong>dual-bottom-line return mechanism</strong>, where enterprises pursue financial returns while setting clear social value bottom lines, such as green investment ratios and social employment contributions, realizing the "institutionalization, quantification, and incentivization" of social value.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: The Multi-Dimensional Leap and Institutional Innovation of Mixed Ownership</h2>
            <p>In summary, mixed ownership reform is undergoing a profound leap from instrumental reform to institutional transformation, carrying the triple mission of building trust mechanisms, testing institutional innovation, and realizing social value:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It reshapes the trust relationship between government and enterprises, and between enterprises and the public through institutionalized cooperation mechanisms;</li>
                <li>As a testing ground for institutional innovation, it provides a practical path for deepening reform and opening up;</li>
                <li>Driven by the dual goals of ESG and common prosperity, it explores the integration of corporate responsibility and market efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the future, mixed ownership should not only be seen as a means of state-owned enterprise reform but also as an important carrier of national governance modernization. By further deepening institutional design, optimizing policy support, and innovating governance models, mixed ownership will provide a solid institutional foundation and inexhaustible internal momentum for the high-quality development of China's economy.</p>
