            <h3>Emotion-Oriented Design</h3>
            <p>Emotion-Oriented Design is a human-centered approach to spatial design, emphasizing how the living environment influences emotional states and mental well-being. By harmonizing elements such as color, lighting, and spatial layout, designers create living spaces that foster positive emotions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Color Psychology:</strong> Different color schemes can directly influence emotions; soft tones can create a relaxed atmosphere.</li>
                <li><strong>Nature Integration:</strong> Incorporating natural elements like plants and water features helps reduce stress.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Interaction:</strong> AI-driven smart home devices, such as lighting and climate control, can respond to human emotions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Temporal Narrativity in Architectural Design</h3>
            <p>Temporal narrativity is an innovative approach in architectural and interior design, emphasizing how spaces evolve and convey different meanings over time. It enriches the spatial experience and evokes emotional resonance.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Space Structures:</strong> Modular or transformative designs allow multifunctional use of spaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Light and Shadow Dynamics:</strong> Natural and artificial lighting is used to create different moods through the passage of day and season.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory and Place:</strong> Material combinations and spatial organization can evoke emotional memories in users.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Micro-Eco Home Systems</h3>
            <p>With the increasing awareness of sustainability, Micro-Eco Home systems are becoming a significant direction in future residential design. These systems emphasize not only comfort but also energy cycles, resource efficiency, and integration with natural ecosystems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vertical Farming:</strong> Incorporating food cultivation within homes to promote localized urban agriculture.</li>
                <li><strong>Rainwater Harvesting:</strong> Integrated rainwater collection systems provide water for domestic use or plant irrigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Waste Recycling Systems:</strong> Automation enables waste sorting and resource regeneration.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Integrated Design for Future Living Spaces</h3>
            <p>The integration of emotion-oriented design, temporal narrativity, and micro-ecological systems marks a future where living spaces evolve toward a higher synthesis of emotional depth and technological innovation. Future homes will not simply be shelters, but rather platforms for healthy, sustainable, and emotionally expressive living.</p>
