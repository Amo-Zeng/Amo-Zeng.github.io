            <h3>I. From "Technique" to "Magic" – Unveiling the Artistic Language Behind the Camera</h3>
            <p>Photography is not just about stacking technical parameters like aperture, shutter speed, and ISO; it's also about casting "magic" through the lens. By redefining the "exposure triangle," we understand that these parameters are not just tools to control light but "magic spells" to control time and space.</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Color:</strong> Not just colors, but magical palettes to convey emotions and create atmospheres</li>
                <li><strong>Case Study:</strong> Analyzing classic photography works to reveal how photographers use "magic" to create breathtaking images</li>
