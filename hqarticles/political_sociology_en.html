            <h2>Power Shifts, Emotions, Trust, and Social Movements in a Platform Perspective: New Directions in Political Sociology in the Digital Era</h2>
            <p>In the digital era, internet platform companies like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok are no longer merely social tools or information channels; they have become new centers of power. This shift of power from traditional political entities to digital platforms has introduced new research topics for political sociology. At the same time, the traditional theory of rational choice shows significant limitations in explaining collective actions, making non-rational factors such as emotions, trust, and values increasingly critical in understanding political social phenomena. This article will delve into the power generation and new issues brought by power shifts under the platform perspective, integrate the theories of emotions, trust, and collective actions, propose coping strategies and social responsibility considerations, and reflect on the "development" narrative to explore new directions in political sociology for countries in the Global South.</p>

            <h3>I. Power Generation in a Platform Perspective</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>1.1 Algorithmic Recommendation Power</strong><br>
                Internet platforms utilize algorithmic recommendation systems to personalize information push based on users' interests and behavior data. This seemingly "user-service" behavior actually grants the platform enormous power: it not only determines what users see but also shapes their cognition and attitudes. The algorithmic recommendation system creates a "filter bubble" effect, immersing users in specific information environments, thereby influencing their political views and social stances.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1.2 Data Analysis Power</strong><br>
                Platform companies possess vast amounts of user data, which are not only commercial assets but also treasure troves of political resources. Through in-depth analysis of user data, platforms can gain insights into public sentiment, preferences, and behavioral patterns, thus playing a crucial role in major events such as political campaigns and social movements. Data power allows platforms to manipulate public opinion behind the scenes and even influence election results.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1.3 Social Network Power</strong><br>
                Social networks are not only channels for information dissemination but also crucial tools for social mobilization. Platforms can quickly gather and disseminate information through the connecting effects of social networks, forming strong social mobilization capabilities. This capability is particularly evident in social movements, protests, and political mobilization, making platforms the new engines of social movements.

            <h3>II. New Problems Brought by Power Shifts</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>2.1 Information Manipulation and Democratic Crisis</strong><br>
                Platforms manipulate information flow through algorithmic recommendation and data analysis, creating "fake news" and "filter bubbles," leading to public cognitive biases and exacerbating social divisions. This information manipulation poses a serious threat to democratic systems, making it difficult for the public to form objective and rational political judgments, thereby weakening the foundation of democratic decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2.2 Power Imbalance and Social Injustice</strong><br>
                The power of platform companies is concentrated in the hands of a few tech giants, leading to an imbalance in the social power structure. These companies, with their technical and data advantages, surpass traditional political entities to become new centers of power, exacerbating social injustice. The monopoly positions of platform companies in various fields of economy, politics, and society squeeze public and government power, presenting new challenges to social governance.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2.3 Privacy Invasion and Ethical Dilemmas</strong><br>
                Platforms obtain sensitive user information through data analysis, infringing on personal privacy. This data power not only leads to privacy leakage but also raises a series of ethical dilemmas. Finding a balance between safeguarding personal privacy and utilizing data has become an urgent ethical issue in the digital era.

            <h3>III. Emotions, Trust, and Collective Actions: A Comprehensive Perspective Beyond Rational Choice</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>3.1 The Role of Emotions in Collective Actions</strong><br>
                Emotions such as anger, fear, and hope play important roles in mobilizing collective actions. For example, anger mobilizes protests, fear influences collective actions in emergencies, and hope provides persistence in the face of significant challenges. The mobilization mechanism of emotions not only relies on the stimulation of a single emotion but also on the transmission and dissemination of emotions to shape collective actions. Social media platforms play a central role in this process by sharing and commenting, quickly gathering and amplifying individual emotions to form broad social resonance, further driving the expansion of collective actions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3.2 The Importance of Trust and Social Trust</strong><br>
                Trust reduces uncertainty and enhances cooperation efficiency in collective actions. Areas with high social trust levels are more likely to take preventive measures and participate in collective actions. The existence of trust can reduce unnecessary conflicts and improve decision-making efficiency. The absence of trust often brings a series of negative effects, such as information asymmetry and unpredictable behavior, increasing internal conflicts within the group and weakening the cohesiveness of collective actions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3.3 The Shaping Role of Values and Identity</strong><br>
                Values and identity influence individuals' political choices and social participation, profoundly shaping collective actions through emotional resonance and social networks. Values and identity shape individual political behavior and collective actions through internal guidance, emotional resonance, and social networking. In political sociology research, exploring the role of values and identity in political phenomena can help us better understand individual behavior choices and provide important theoretical guidance for formulating effective social policies and promoting social harmony.

            <h3>IV. Coping Strategies: Collaboration Among Government, Businesses, and Society</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>4.1 The Role of Government</strong><br>
                Governments should strengthen supervision over platforms, formulate strict laws and regulations, standardize platform behavior, ensure algorithmic fairness and transparency, and promote data privacy protection legislation. Governments need to establish transparent algorithmic auditing mechanisms to ensure platform algorithms are fair and transparent, avoiding information manipulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>4.2 Corporate Responsibility</strong><br>
                Platform companies should take on social responsibility by establishing an ethical framework to regulate data usage and information dissemination. Companies should actively disclose algorithmic mechanisms, accept public supervision, ensure information fairness and transparency, and establish an independent data ethics committee to review and supervise the legality and moral aspects of data usage.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>4.3 Social Participation</strong><br>
                The public should improve digital literacy, enhance their ability to identify information manipulation, and actively participate in social governance. Social organizations and non-governmental institutions should play a supervisory role, promote platform transparency, and expose information manipulation behaviors. Academic circles should strengthen research on platform power shifts, propose new theories and methods, and provide academic support for social governance.

            <h3>V. Reflecting on the "Development" Narrative: New Directions in Political Sociology for Global South Countries</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>5.1 Western-Dominated International Order and Southern Countries' Development Paths</strong><br>
                Southern countries seek their development paths within the Western-dominated international order, exploring diverse national development models. These countries face challenges in finding development paths suitable to themselves amidst the Western-dominated international order, with experiences in colonial history and post-independence political and economic transitions. For instance, some countries have achieved rapid economic growth by integrating into the global market but also face issues like increased social inequality and environmental damage. Others choose non-Western development paths, such as state-driven economic development models, seeking economic autonomy and social fairness.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>5.2 Interaction Between Different Civilization Traditions and Political Systems and Governance Models</strong><br>
                Southern countries have diverse and rich civilization traditions, encompassing various forms from African tribal systems to Asian Confucian culture. These traditions play significant roles in shaping political systems and governance models. For example, Confucian culture emphasizes hierarchical order and social harmony, profoundly influencing political stability and social governance in East Asian countries; while African tribal systems may lead to power decentralization and low decision-making efficiency in national construction. Political sociology needs to focus on the interaction between different civilization traditions and political systems and governance models, exploring how these traditions are retained, adjusted, or dissolved in the modernization process and their roles under specific social conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>5.3 The Role of Social Movements in the Modernization Process</strong><br>
                Social movements play significant roles in the modernization process of southern countries. These movements often arise from resistance against social injustice, economic imbalances, and political oppression, promoting social change and political transformation. For example, Latin America's "Revolución Ciudadana" and "Pink Tide" have spurred the rise of left-wing political forces, while social movements in Africa have driven democratization through peaceful protests and community organizations. Political sociology needs to focus on the causes, dynamic mechanisms, and impacts of these social movements, exploring how they promote social change and political reforms in the modernization process and interact with other social forces to shape the country's political and social structures.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>5.4 Promoting Diversification in Political Sociology Research</strong><br>
                Reflecting on the "development" narrative means we need to go beyond the Western-centered research paradigm and focus on the unique experiences and challenges of Global South countries. This not only requires political sociology researchers to innovate in methodology and theoretical frameworks but also to pay attention to the local knowledge systems and practical experiences of southern countries. Through interdisciplinary collaboration and cross-national comparative research, we can build a more diverse and inclusive political sociology theory, providing new perspectives and tools for understanding political social phenomena in Global South countries.
