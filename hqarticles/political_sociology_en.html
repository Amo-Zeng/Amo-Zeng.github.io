In the high school mathematics curriculum in China, "Shu Jia" (数甲) typically refers to the **High School Mathematics Series A**, a set of mathematics textbooks published by the People's Education Press (PEP) in the past. This series was widely used in the early 2000s and earlier, known for its higher level of difficulty, primarily targeting science stream students or those with strong mathematical abilities. Below is a detailed introduction to Shu Jia:

### 1. **Differences Between Shu Jia and Shu Yi**
- **Shu Jia (Series A)**: The content is deeper and broader, including introductory calculus, complex numbers, rigorous proofs in solid geometry, and more, making it suitable for science stream students with higher mathematical demands.
- **Shu Yi (Series B)**: The content is relatively more basic, with some challenging topics removed, focusing on practical applications, and is suitable for liberal arts students or those with weaker mathematical foundations.

### 2. **Main Content of Shu Jia**
The typical topics covered in Shu Jia (based on older editions) include:
- **Algebra**: Polynomials, complex numbers, permutations and combinations, binomial theorem.
- **Geometry**: Solid geometry (space vectors, polyhedron volumes), analytic geometry (conic sections, parametric equations).
- **Introductory Calculus**: Limits, derivatives (e.g., finding extrema of functions), integrals (definite integrals and applications).
- **Probability and Statistics**: Discrete probability, normal distribution (partial content).

### 3. **Current Status and Replacement Textbooks**
- After 2004, PEP introduced new curriculum standard textbooks, and the classification of Shu Jia/Shu Yi was gradually phased out. The current textbooks are divided into:
  - **Compulsory** (for all students): Basic content such as functions, sequences, and probability.
  - **Selective Compulsory/Elective** (for science stream students): More advanced topics like derivatives, space vectors, and in-depth probability.
- Currently, science stream students typically study the **Elective Series 2** (e.g., Elective 2-1, 2-2, 2-3), which is similar in difficulty to the former Shu Jia.

### 4. **Recommendations for Using Shu Jia**
- **Reference Value**: If you are preparing for competitions or independent enrollment exams, some classic problem types in Shu Jia remain challenging and useful.
- **Alternative Resources**: In addition to the new curriculum standard textbooks, you can refer to supplementary materials such as *Five Years of College Entrance Exam Questions and Three Years of Simulation* (*五年高考三年模拟*) and *High School Mathematics Competition Training Tutorials* (*高中数学竞赛培优教程*).
