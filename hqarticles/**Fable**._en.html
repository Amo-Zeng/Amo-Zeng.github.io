            <h2>I. Technological Variation: The Disintegration of the Performing Subject in the Cocoon of Data</h2>
            <p>In the ancient Greek theater, masks were seals of morality, and the stage was a projection of order. Actors, through stylized gestures, narrated fables of divine will and human nature, their roles serving as vessels for the measurement of good and evil. Yet, when the 21st-century spotlight pierces through the skeletal mesh of motion-capture systems, and when AI-generated characters whisper on stage, "Why do I exist?" through algorithmic voices, theater is no longer about "telling stories of humanity"—it has become <strong>a parable of the disintegration of subjectivity under technological intervention</strong>.</p>
            <p>In <em>AI: When a Robot Writes a Play</em>, the neural network system "AI-Playwright" not only generates scripts but also reads audience heart rate, respiration, and galvanic skin response via biosensors, dynamically adjusting character destinies in real time. When "Hamlet" suddenly turns to the audience in Act III and says, "Do you want me to avenge, or to forgive?—your heartbeat tells me the answer," the theater ceases to be a one-way moral instruction and becomes a <strong>reverse interrogation of subjectivity</strong>: Who is the true "author"? The actor’s body is decomposed into streams of data—bones, muscles, facial expressions—projected via motion capture into virtual avatars, while those virtual characters in turn "perform" as real humans, forming what Deleuze calls the <strong>"body without organs"</strong>—a body no longer a carrier of meaning, but an interface for data exchange, a theatrical manifestation of Haraway’s <strong>"cyborg"</strong>.</p>
            <p>Even more unsettling is the immersive space of <em>SLEEP NO MORE</em>, where audiences don VR headsets and become algorithmic "accomplices." Narrative paths are determined by real-time behavioral data; every turn, every gaze, reshapes the story structure. This is no longer Aristotle’s "mimesis," but what Lacan calls the <strong>"collapse of the symbolic order"</strong>: the audience, in "watching," becomes the watched; in "choosing," becomes a feedback loop for algorithms. Theater thus evolves from "parable" to "meta-parable"—no longer telling "how humans are punished by fate," but <strong>exposing how humans lose their performative subjectivity within technology</strong>.</p>
            <p>Baudrillard’s <strong>"order of simulacra"</strong> becomes embodied here: when characters are AI-generated, plots data-driven, and audiences defined by behavior, theater no longer "reflects reality," but "generates reality"—a <strong>cocoon of data</strong> co-constructed by technology, algorithms, and perception. We are wrapped within it, believing we are "participating," when in fact we are "being participated."</p>
            <div class="transition">Transition: When technology is no longer a tool, but becomes the subject’s "second body," the dissolution of the performative subject extends beyond the stage—into the entire social mechanism of identity performance. Are we, too, in daily life, wearing data as masks and algorithms as scripts, performing an endless "identity play"?</div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>II. Identity Variation: The Fluid "I" in the Sea of Mirrors</h2>
            <p>If technological variation reveals the crisis of "who performs," then identity variation asks: "who is being performed?" Traditional parable rests on a fixed correspondence between "character—symbol": fox = cunning, lion = authority. This structure depends on <strong>the stability and recognizability of identity</strong>. But in contemporary theater, this stability is being utterly destabilized.</p>
            <p>In the 2023 immersive adaptation of <em>The Metamorphosis</em>, audiences are randomly assigned roles—some are Gregor, others his sister, the landlord, or even the "voice" of the beetle. Roles shift continuously during performance, and identity flows through the narrative. This is not mere "multi-perspective storytelling," but a construction of an <strong>anti-parable structure</strong>: symbols no longer fixed, meanings no longer transparent, morals no longer clear. As Deleuze writes, the contemporary subject is a process of <strong>"becoming-other"</strong>, not a bearer of essence.</p>
            <p>This practice reaches its peak in <em>SLEEP NO MORE</em>. When an audience member picks up a comb in Lady Macbeth’s bedroom, the system designates them as her "accomplice"; when they gaze at an actor in the corridor, they are algorithmically marked as a "potential lover." Identity is no longer granted by script, but <strong>temporarily generated by the audience’s gaze, action, and choice</strong>. This echoes Judith Butler’s <strong>theory of gender performativity</strong>: identity is not the externalization of an inner essence, but "performed" through repeated acts. In theater, identity becomes an ongoing performance—every interaction reshapes "who I am."</p>
            <p>Even more radical is the live-streamed play <em>Danmaku Play: Hamlet 2.0</em>, where audiences rewrite the plot in real time via live comments ("danmaku"). When Hamlet hesitates over revenge, danmaku flood in: "Kill him!" "Don’t kill!" "Let him kill himself!" The system decides the character’s action based on comment density and emotional tone. Here, identity no longer belongs to the character or the audience, but to a <strong>flowing field of collective discourse</strong>. Hamlet is no longer the Prince of Denmark, but "us"—a temporary community formed by danmaku.</p>
            <p>This fluidity of identity is a parable of contemporary society. On social media, we edit our faces with filters, define ourselves with hashtags, and confirm existence through likes. We are both "I" and "the I I perform." Lacan’s <strong>"mirror stage"</strong> is infinitely extended in the digital age: we constantly confirm ourselves in virtual mirrors, yet never touch the "true self"—because that "self" has already dissolved in performance.</p>
            <p>Thus, contemporary theatrical parable no longer attempts to "reveal" a fixed essence of human nature, but <strong>exposes how identity is co-performed by media, technology, and social discourse</strong>. It no longer asks, "Why is the fox cunning?" but "Why do we always see the fox as cunning?" It no longer tells "how the lion rules," but questions, "How is rule naturalized through symbolic structures?"</p>
            <p>This is the core of the anti-parable: <strong>not the negation of parable, but parable’s self-deconstruction</strong>. It offers no moral answers, but shows how morals are constructed, questioned, and made fluid. In the adaptation of <em>The Metamorphosis</em>, Gregor is no longer a symbol of "alienation," but the performer of "alienation" itself—exposing, through every role shift, the fragility of the concept "human."</p>
            <div class="transition">Transition: When identity constantly transgresses boundaries, when "I" becomes a temporary product of "we," theater is no longer merely a parable of individual identity—it begins to carry a larger collective psychological structure: it becomes the dark river of unconsciousness flowing through intermediality.</div>

        <section>
            <h2>III. Media Variation: The Dark River of the Unconscious and the Container of Complicity</h2>
            <p>If technological variation deconstructs the subject, and identity variation destabilizes the role, then media variation pushes theater from "individual performance" to the "exhibition of collective consciousness." In today’s world, where digital media is deeply embedded in daily life, theater is no longer confined to proscenium stages or black-box theaters. It evolves, through live streaming, short videos, social media, and danmaku interaction, into a <strong>transmedia "collective unconscious theater."</strong></p>
            <p>As Kittler noted, media are <strong>"writing systems of the unconscious"</strong>—they do not express consciousness, but shape it. In <em>Danmaku Play: Hamlet 2.0</em>, danmaku are not just interactive tools, but real-time writings of collective emotion. When "Hamlet" hesitates, and the density of "Kill him!" surges, the system judges that "audience emotion has reached a threshold," and the character draws his sword. At this moment, theater is no longer "telling a story," but <strong>directly exhibiting the unconscious of society</strong>. What we see is not Hamlet’s hesitation, but the collective anxiety of contemporary youth between "action and evasion."</p>
            <p>In the live play <em>#MeToo: The Play That Watches You</em>, audiences enter "character perspectives" via a mobile app: you choose to be victim, perpetrator, bystander, or whistleblower, and the system delivers different plotlines based on your choice. But more crucially, your choices are anonymously aggregated into a real-time "social emotion heatmap"—when most choose "silence," the stage lights dim; when "whistleblowing" rises, alarms sound in the theater. This is not mere interactivity, but a <strong>parable of intermediality</strong>: individual choices are transformed by media systems into collective emotion, which in turn reshapes individual behavior.</p>
            <p>This is precisely what Adorno warned of in <em>The Culture Industry</em> as <strong>"pseudo-participation"</strong>—we believe we are "freely expressing," but are actually repeating dominant discourse under algorithmic guidance. When danmaku become products of "trending word suggestions," and short videos conform to platform algorithms, the collective unconscious theater risks becoming a <strong>new ideological apparatus</strong>: it allows anxiety to be "performed," but prevents it from being "reflected upon"; it allows identity to be "presented," but obscures the roots of "alienation."</p>
            <p>Even more profound is the frequent emergence of <strong>"unconscious complicity"</strong> in these media theaters. In the special live-streamed edition of <em>SLEEP NO MORE</em>, audiences watch the performance via Zoom, while simultaneously discussing, spoiling, and even organizing "collective actions" in chatrooms—some initiate a "Rescue Macbeth" vote, others plan a "collective escape." Here, the theater is no longer a physical space, but a <strong>networked node of distributed consciousness</strong>. We no longer "watch" theater, but "participate" in a collective ritual—a <strong>social consciousness experiment</strong> mediated by media, expressed in data, and performed through action.</p>
            <p>Habermas’s <strong>"communicative rationality"</strong> faces a severe challenge: when "communication" is mediated by algorithms, and "consensus" is quantified by data, can reason still emerge in theater? Perhaps the true value of contemporary theatrical parable lies not in achieving understanding, but in <strong>exposing the obstacles to understanding</strong>—in every misreading of danmaku, every VR vertigo, every live-stream delay, we glimpse the impossibility and necessity of "communication" itself.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion: Can Parable Still Ignite a Gap in the Long Night of Simulacra?</h2>
            <p>From the technological deconstruction of the subject, to the fluidity of identity in performance, to media as a container of collective unconscious, contemporary theatrical parable has transformed from a "moral tale" into a "performative experiment in social consciousness." It no longer tries to tell us "what is good," but <strong>lets us experience, through performance, "who we are."</strong></p>
            <p>Yet this is not entirely liberation. When algorithms decide plots, when danmaku control characters, when identity dissolves in data streams, are we not entering a deeper <strong>prison of simulacra</strong>? When theater becomes a container of collective unconscious, does it not also become an amplifier of emotion and a machine of prejudice reproduction? When "participation" becomes a new form of consumption, are we merely being manipulated more subtly?</p>
            <p>Here, theatrical parable may still be <strong>the last lamp of resistance</strong>. It does not provide answers, but <strong>exposes mechanisms</strong>: how technology shapes us, how identity is performed, how media carries the unconscious. It offers no salvation, but <strong>a critical gap</strong>—in every role shift, every danmaku explosion, every VR immersion, we briefly "step outside" ourselves and see the "I" woven by technology, media, and social discourse.</p>
            <p>As Žižek said, ideology is not "we don’t know it’s false," but "we know it’s false yet still believe." Contemporary theatrical parable is precisely such a <strong>theatrical practice of the ideological sublime object</strong>: we know danmaku are algorithmically filtered, identity is temporary, VR is virtual—yet we still engage. For in this "knowingly false" performance, we briefly touch upon <strong>real anxiety and desire</strong>.</p>
            <p>When AI-generated plays perform in the metaverse, when neural interfaces let audiences "experience" characters’ emotions, when theater becomes fully virtual—can parable still carry the weight of "truth"? Perhaps the answer lies not in technology itself, but in whether we can still <strong>in the cocoon of data, preserve one silence, one mistake, one gaze unpredictable by algorithms</strong>.</p>
            <p>In the metaverse theater, when characters are generated by large language models in real time, plots evolve dynamically with user emotions, and stages are authenticated by blockchain, can theater still preserve the <strong>"critical gap"</strong>? When performance becomes infinitely reproducible NFTs, and "presence" is defined as "data synchronization," can parable still resist complete commodification?</p>
            <p>Perhaps the true hope lies in: <strong>the more perfect the technology, the more we need imperfect performance</strong>. In the flawless narrative generated by AI, an actor’s tremor, an audience member’s silence, a live-stream interruption—these "failures" are the fissures where parable is reborn. They remind us: theater’s "truth" does not lie in realism, but in the <strong>unpredictable, algorithmically untamable</strong> moment.</p>
            <p>When neural interfaces let us "feel" others’ pain, can we still distinguish "empathy" from "intrusion"? When the metaverse theater lets everyone "become" Hamlet, will we remember that <strong>true tragedy is not becoming the other, but no longer being able to become oneself</strong>?</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>The last lamp of parable does not lie in answers, but in questions—in every performance distorted by technology, in every mirror shattered by fluid identity, in every gaze amplified by media yet still untamed.</strong><br>
                It does not illuminate the future, but reminds us: <strong>in the long night of simulacra, we still can, and must, preserve the ability to question.</strong>
            </blockquote>
