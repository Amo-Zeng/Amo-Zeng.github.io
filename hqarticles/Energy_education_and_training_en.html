            <h2>Upgrading the Concept of Energy Education</h2>
            <p>Energy, as the cornerstone of human social development, is undergoing unprecedented transformation. From fossil fuels to clean energy, from centralized to decentralized systems, from single energy sources to multi-energy complementarity, the energy system is evolving towards being smarter, more efficient, and more sustainable. In this historical process, traditional "energy literacy" can no longer meet the demands of future energy development. We need to move towards a higher level of "energy wisdom." At the same time, the innovation of educational models has become an important engine driving energy transformation. Emerging educational methods such as gamified learning and micro-credentials are reshaping the future of energy education, providing strong talent support for building a low-carbon, efficient, and sustainable energy ecosystem.</p>
