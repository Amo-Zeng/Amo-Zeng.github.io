            <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
            <p>The Geolocation API is a technology based on HTML5 that allows developers to access users' geographical location information. By invoking the built-in functions of the browser or device, the Geolocation API can obtain data such as the user's latitude, longitude, altitude, and speed. Here is a simple example of how to use the Geolocation API to get the user's current location:</p>
            <pre><code>if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
        console.log("Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude);
        console.log("Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude);
    });
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}</code></pre>
            <h3>Application Scenarios</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Location Recommendations:</strong> Many e-commerce platforms and catering applications use the Geolocation API to recommend nearby stores or restaurants to users. For example, when a user opens a food delivery app, the system automatically detects the user's location and displays nearby restaurants and their reviews.</li>
                <li><strong>Navigation Services:</strong> Map applications and navigation services are one of the most common application scenarios for the Geolocation API. By obtaining the user's real-time location, the application can provide precise navigation routes, helping users reach their destinations quickly.</li>
