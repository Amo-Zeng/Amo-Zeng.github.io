            <h3>Brand Voice: Establishing Unique Identity and Recognition</h3>
            <p>Brand voice identity is a crucial means for brands to establish a differentiated image in consumers' minds. By introducing iconic sound effects or music, brands can quickly form strong recognition and associations in the minds of consumers. For example, Apple's startup sound and Intel's "Intel Inside" have become symbolic of their brands and have garnered significant global brand recognition. The creation of these sound identities requires alignment with core brand values and target audiences, ensuring resonance in international markets.</p>

            <h3>Emotional Connection: Evoking Consumer Emotions</h3>
            <p>Sound effects can directly influence consumers' emotional responses, serving as a powerful tool for emotional brand marketing. Through carefully designed sound effects, brands can touch consumers' hearts, stimulate emotional resonance, and thereby enhance consumer memory and loyalty. For instance, Coca-Cola's advertisements use warm music and sound effects to convey feelings of togetherness and happiness, linking these emotions closely to the brand. This emotional connection not only helps brands stand out in competition but also strengthens long-term brand loyalty.</p>
