            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Amidst the intertwined trends of digital transformation and global population aging, education as the core system of social cognition and cultural transmission is undergoing unprecedented structural changes and functional reshaping. This article delves into the multidimensional evolution and inherent tensions of contemporary education through three perspectives: deterritorialized educational practices in the digital nomad era, cognitive immunity curriculum design for the post-truth age, and reverse-growth communities where elderly populations engage in basic education. The aim is to construct a comprehensive new educational paradigm that transcends spatial boundaries, spans generations, and integrates neuroscientific and sociocultural perspectives.</p>

            <h3>1. From Deterritorialized Learning Spaces to Fluid Educational Governance</h3>
            <p>The advent of the digital nomad era has given rise to distributed learning forms unbound by fixed locations, completely breaking traditional education's dependence on physical school buildings. Children of digital nomads achieve cross-border sharing and deep integration of educational resources and cultural capital through cloud-based courses, AI-personalized learning paths, and global collaborative projects.</p>
            <p>This deterritorialized education not only challenges nation-states' monopoly over educational resources but also presents new governance challenges in global educational mobility. However, this transformation also brings complex issues regarding learning continuity, cultural identity preservation, and socialization functions.</p>
            <p>The deconstruction of educational spaces involves more than physical mobility—it triggers profound reconstructions of social structures and identity formation. Traditional institutionalized education serves as a socialization mechanism responsible for social hierarchy reproduction, cultural transmission, and collective belonging, creating fundamental tensions with deterritorialized mobile education.</p>
            <p>At the policy level, challenges of transnational educational jurisdiction and cultural identity are becoming increasingly prominent. While countries like Finland and Denmark offer flexible mechanisms for mobile populations worth referencing, a globally applicable governance framework remains lacking. Addressing these challenges requires integrating spatial sociology perspectives, innovating hybrid online-offline educational models, and strengthening transnational legal frameworks for educational management to balance cultural identity with global resource sharing.</p>

            <h3>2. Education as Cognitive Immune System: Neuroscience-Driven Critical Thinking Innovation</h3>
            <p>In the post-truth era, the crisis of information pollution urgently requires education to develop "cognitive immunity" functions. Neuroscience reveals that the prefrontal cortex serves as the neural hub for information filtering, impulse control, and metacognitive regulation, providing scientific foundations for designing curricula focused on information filtration and logical analysis.</p>
            <p>Building on this, we propose an "information metabolism" training concept that mimics the human immune system's pathogen filtering mechanism, emphasizing source-tracing exercises and logical fallacy simulations to strengthen students' evidence identification and rational decision-making abilities.</p>
            <p>Empirical studies show this curriculum significantly activates the prefrontal cortex, enhances resistance to conspiracy theories, and improves metacognitive awareness, effectively countering misinformation interference. In simulated democratic decision-making experiments, participants trained in critical thinking demonstrate more rational and public-interest-oriented voting behaviors, validating education's strategic role as a cognitive immune system in social governance.</p>

            <h3>3. Reverse-Growth Communities: Cognitive Symbiosis in Intergenerational Education Within Aging Societies</h3>
            <p>Population aging is transforming elderly groups from passive recipients into active participants in basic education, forming "reverse-growth communities." This emerging educational model based on cross-age interactions activates mirror neurons, delaying cognitive decline in seniors while enhancing children's empathy and social cognition.</p>
            <p>The cultural capital transmission mechanism in this process exhibits bidirectional "translation"—elders use traditional proverbs to deepen children's cultural understanding, while children help seniors adapt to new media through digital memes. This cross-semiotic translation process not only promotes cognitive flexibility and cultural integration but also bridges generational gaps and enriches societal cognitive schemas.</p>
            <p>From a policy perspective, integrating senior human resources into education systems enhances social capital, reduces care costs, and indirectly alleviates declining fertility rates by positively transforming elderly social identities. Reverse-growth communities exemplify an ecological paradigm for educational innovation in aging societies, reshaping intergenerational relationships and learning structures.</p>

            <h3>4. Constructing a Multidimensional Educational Paradigm for the New Era</h3>
            <p>These three perspectives collectively highlight modern education's core challenges and opportunities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spatial Dimension:</strong> Deterritorialized and globally mobile education urges us to transcend nation-state boundaries, redesigning flexible, hybrid, transnational learning ecosystems that balance global resource sharing with local cultural identity.</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Mechanism Dimension:</strong> Neuroscience-revealed brain mechanisms provide scientific foundations for educational innovation, with critical thinking training becoming crucial for countering post-truth information pollution and fostering rational democratic decision-making.</li>
                <li><strong>Generational Dimension:</strong> Cross-age mutual learning and bidirectional cultural capital transmission build emotionally and cognitively co-developing communities, injecting new vitality and educational resources into aging societies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Future educational system design should move beyond singular breakthroughs to construct ecosystems integrating spatial deterritorialization, neuroscientific foundations, and intergenerational fusion. Policymaking must coordinate technological development, social needs, and cultural governance to create multi-level, multi-stakeholder educational governance structures.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Behind the dual transformations of digital economy and demographic structure lies a profound interrogation of education's essence: education is not merely a site for knowledge transmission but a shaping mechanism for cognitive structures, cultural identities, and even social orders. The mobile learning models of the digital nomad era reveal the elasticity and mobility of "learning spaces"; the cognitive immunity strategies for the post-truth age embody neuroscientific demands for "thought filtration"; while reverse-growth communities in aging societies demonstrate the affective-cognitive dynamics of "intergenerational symbiosis."</p>
            <p>Constructing future-oriented educational systems requires finding harmonizing paths amid these three tensions: respecting spatial openness and boundaries, strengthening scientific cognitive training, and activating intergenerational social capital. Only then can education truly respond to the profound transformations in information and demographic paradigms, radiating transcultural, pluralistic, and expansive vitality to propel fundamental leaps in human cognitive capacities and democratic governance.</p>
