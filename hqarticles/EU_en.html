            <h2>The Path of EU Transformation: Interplay of Sovereignty Game, Global Role, and Social Change</h2>
            <p>Since the initiation of European integration in the 1950s, the EU has always been in a complex game between member states' sovereignty and the power of supranational institutions. This game has not only profoundly affected the EU's decision-making mechanisms and policy directions but also given rise to new challenges in the digital age. Meanwhile, global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukrainian crisis have prompted the EU to reconsider its global role and make strategic adjustments in areas such as multilateralism, climate change, and digital governance. Additionally, the EU faces unprecedented social changes, with issues such as the migration crisis and economic inequality not only exacerbating internal contradictions but also profoundly affecting citizens' identity. This article will explore the path of the EU's transformation from three aspects: sovereignty game, global role reshaping, and social change, analyzing its challenges and future development directions.</p>

            <h3>I. The Game of Sovereignty and Supranational Power: From History to the Digital Age</h3>
            <h4>Historical Context: Tension Between Sovereignty and Integration</h4>
            <p>The birth of the EU stems from European countries' common pursuit of peace and prosperity, but its integration process has always been accompanied by a game between member states' sovereignty and the power of supranational institutions. The signing of the Rome Treaty marked the establishment of the European Economic Community, laying the foundation for the power of supranational institutions, but the retention of member states' sovereignty remained a core feature of integration. With the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, the EU further advanced political integration, expanding the power of supranational institutions, but this process also triggered strong resistance from member states. In 2005, France and the Netherlands vetoed the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe, marking the peak of member states' resistance to supranational power.</p>
            <h4>"Multi-Speed Europe" and the Sovereignty Declaration: A New Phase in Power Game</h4>
            <p>In recent years, the concept of "multi-speed Europe" has marked a new phase in the EU's power game. This concept advocates allowing some member states to move forward first in specific areas, promoting deeper integration, while others can remain relatively independent. On the surface, this respects member states' sovereignty, but in reality, it exacerbates the power struggle between core and peripheral countries. Core countries such as Germany and France hope to accelerate the integration process through this, while Eastern European countries are more reserved. This divergence not only exposes the interest conflicts among member states but also highlights the dilemmas faced by supranational institutions in promoting integration.</p>
            <h4>Challenges in the Digital Age: Data Sovereignty and Tech Regulation</h4>
            <p>Entering the digital age, the EU's power game in areas such as data sovereignty and tech regulation has become increasingly complex. The争夺 of data sovereignty involves countries' control over their own data, while tech regulation concerns the EU's position in global tech competition. The EU has established the world's most stringent data protection standards through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), aiming to protect citizens' privacy and data sovereignty. However, this regulation has also triggered disputes among member states, with some fearing that strict regulations could weaken the competitiveness of their tech companies.</p>

            <h3>II. Reshaping the Global Role: Strategic Adjustments in the Post-Pandemic Era and Under the Ukrainian Crisis</h3>
            <h4>Reshaping Multilateralism</h4>
            <p>The global pandemic of COVID-19 exposed the harms of unilateralism and protectionism, prompting the EU to reconsider its global strategy. The EU has increased its investment in multilateral cooperation mechanisms, emphasizing strengthening global health cooperation under frameworks such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization. Through vaccine assistance and export, the EU promoted "vaccine diplomacy," enhancing its international image and contributing significantly to global cooperation against the pandemic.</p>
            <h4>Climate Change and Green Transformation</h4>
            <p>Climate change is a common challenge facing the world, and the EU has demonstrated strong leadership in this area. Through the "European Green Deal," the EU aims to achieve "carbon neutrality" by 2050 and plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030. The EU not only promotes green transformation internally but also influences the formulation of global climate policies through "green diplomacy," advancing the implementation of the Paris Agreement.</p>
            <h4>Digital Governance and Technological Sovereignty</h4>
            <p>With the rapid development of digital technology, the EU has shown foresight in digital governance. Through regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU has established the world's most stringent standards for digital privacy protection. In addition, the EU has proposed the concept of "digital sovereignty," aiming to reduce reliance on U.S. tech giants and promote the development of European digital technology. By increasing investment in digital infrastructure, the EU seeks to take a more proactive position in global digital governance.</p>

            <h3>III. Social Change and Identity: Migration, Economic Inequality, and Cultural Integration</h3>
            <h4>The Migration Crisis and Economic Inequality</h4>
            <p>In recent years, the migration crisis and economic inequality in Europe have exacerbated internal contradictions. Although migration is seen as a potential source of labor for economic development, its influx has also triggered social instability, cultural conflicts, and security threats. The EU has sought to reduce the influx of illegal immigrants by strengthening cooperation with third countries and promoting a fairer refugee distribution mechanism among member states. At the same time, the EU has attempted to narrow economic gaps among member states by advancing structural reforms, strengthening the single market, and promoting digital transformation.</p>
            <h4>Evolution of Identity</h4>
            <p>With the deepening of social change, the identity of EU citizens is also gradually evolving. The influx of immigrants and the increase in cultural diversity have made the cultural landscape of European society more complex. The traditional single-cultural identity is increasingly unsuited to the current social reality, and the concept of "European" is gradually evolving from a singular national or ethnic identity to a broader cultural, social, and political identity. Globalization and technological progress have also accelerated the diversification of identity. The rights granted by EU citizenship, such as freedom of movement, social insurance, and voting rights, have made "European" no longer an abstract concept but a concrete sense of belonging.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The path of the EU's transformation is full of challenges and opportunities. The game between sovereignty and supranational power, the reshaping of the global role, and the evolution of social change and identity collectively constitute the main issues the EU faces today. The EU needs to find a new balance point in the digital age, play a leading role in multilateralism and climate change, and enhance citizens' cohesion through cultural and educational cooperation. In the future, whether the EU can play a more critical role on the global stage will depend on its ability to effectively address these challenges and continue to lead in global cooperation. Only in this way can the EU maintain its unique charm and competitiveness in the wave of globalization and continue to advance as a united and powerful community.</p>
