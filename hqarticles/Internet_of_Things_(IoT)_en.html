            <h3>Core Advantages of Collaborative Applications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-time Responsiveness:</strong> Edge node data processing eliminates cloud transmission delays, meeting millisecond-level response requirements for scenarios like autonomous driving.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Data Security:</strong> Sensitive data is processed locally, effectively reducing the risk of data breaches during cloud transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>Bandwidth Optimization:</strong> Edge preprocessing reduces the amount of data needing cloud upload, conserving network resources.</li>
            </ul>
