            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the modern urbanization process, the construction and optimization of transportation networks have always been the core challenges in city development. Traditional transportation systems often focus on the "main arteries"—main roads and highways—while neglecting the "capillaries"—country roads and urban micro-circulation systems, leading to increasing vulnerability of urban transportation systems. Meanwhile, transportation hubs, as the "super node" of the city, are redefining their functions and spatial forms through the deep application of intelligent technologies. However, with the expansion of urban scale and the increasing diversity of travel needs, traffic congestion has become a social governance issue worldwide. This article delves into the dual perspectives of "capillaries" and "super nodes" to explore how intelligent technologies reshape transportation networks and how technological innovation, policy optimization, and social collaboration can drive systemic governance of traffic congestion.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>1. The "Capillaries" of the Transportation Network: The Reconstruction and Challenges of Country Roads and Urban Micro-Circulation Systems</h2>
            <h3>The Strategic Role of Country Roads and Urban Micro-Circulation Systems</h3>
            <p>As the "capillaries" of the transportation network, rural roads and urban micro-circulation systems are not only the key links for the integration of urban and rural economies but also the basic support for the efficient operation of urban traffic. Rural roads connect vast rural areas, carrying functions such as agricultural product transportation, rural tourism, and urban-rural economic interaction. Their smoothness directly impacts the balanced development of regional economies. Urban micro-circulation systems, by connecting main roads with residential and commercial areas, play the role of a "traffic splitter," effectively relieving the pressure on main roads and improving the overall efficiency of urban traffic.</p>
            <p>However, the functions of these "capillaries" have not received sufficient attention, and the multiple challenges they face in construction and maintenance have to some extent constrained the sustainable development of regional economies. The low construction standards and insufficient investment in rural roads lead to low traffic efficiency. The lagging planning of urban micro-circulation systems exacerbates traffic congestion within cities.</p>
            <h3>Building an Intelligent and Sustainable "Capillary" Network</h3>
            <p>To construct a more comprehensive "capillary" network, it is necessary to approach from three dimensions: policy, technology, and ecology.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Policy support and funding are the foundation.</strong> The state should increase financial support for rural road construction, raise construction standards, and ensure quality and traffic efficiency. Cities need to optimize funding allocation, focusing on improving the planning and construction of micro-circulation systems, especially in new urban development and old city redevelopment, with attention to micro-scale traffic layouts.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological innovation is the key.</strong> By introducing intelligent transportation management systems, real-time monitoring of rural road traffic conditions can optimize resource allocation. In urban micro-circulation systems, intelligent traffic lights, vehicle-road coordination technology, and autonomous driving technology can dynamically adjust traffic flow and improve efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological protection is an indispensable factor.</strong> In the construction of the "capillary" network, the demand for green transportation should be fully considered to promote sustainable development of urban-rural traffic networks. For example, integrating bike paths and walkways into urban micro-circulation systems can reduce reliance on private cars, achieving a harmonious coexistence of transportation and the environment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. The "Super Nodes" of Transportation Hubs: Urban Space Transformation Driven by Intelligent Technologies</h2>
            <h3>The Bottlenecks and Limitations of Traditional Transportation Hubs</h3>
            <p>The limitations of traditional transportation hubs in function and layout have become an important factor restricting urban transportation efficiency. Limited by technical means, traditional hubs lack flexibility and adaptability, making it difficult to cope with the complex demands brought by rapid urban development. For example, congestion during peak hours and information asymmetry not only reduce transportation efficiency but also affect user travel experiences. Additionally, the relatively outdated facilities and equipment of traditional hubs are difficult to meet the needs of the intelligent era, further exacerbating their functional limitations.</p>
            <h3>Multi-dimensional Paths for Intelligent Technology to Reshape Transportation Hubs</h3>
            <p>The widespread application of intelligent technologies is giving transportation hubs new vitality.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The introduction of big data technology makes the operation and management of transportation hubs more efficient.</strong> Real-time data collection and analysis enable hubs to accurately predict passenger flow and optimize schedule adjustments, effectively alleviating congestion during peak hours.</li>
                <li><strong>The application of artificial intelligence technology drives the innovation of hub service models.</strong> The popularization of self-service ticketing machines, intelligent navigation systems, and face recognition security checks significantly improves passenger convenience.</li>
                <li><strong>The introduction of 5G technology brings revolutionary changes to the spatial form of hubs.</strong> Through high-speed network connections, the monitoring, navigation, and information systems within hubs achieve seamless coordination, reducing the complexity of space and resource waste.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Multi-functional Integration of Transportation Hubs and Urban Space Transformation</h3>
            <p>Intelligent technologies not only reshape the functions of transportation hubs but also promote the organic integration of hubs with other urban functions. For example, intelligent high-speed rail stations and smart airports, through linkage with surrounding commercial, office, and residential areas, form comprehensive urban nodes integrating transportation, commerce, entertainment, and office functions. This integration not only enhances the attractiveness of hubs but also drives the reshaping and functional upgrading of urban space, injecting new vitality into urban development.</p>

            <h2>3. Multi-dimensional Governance of Traffic Congestion: From Technological Breakthroughs to Social Collaboration</h2>
            <h3>Systemic Causes of Traffic Congestion</h3>
            <p>The causes of traffic congestion are complex, involving technology, policy, and society. From a technological perspective, unreasonable urban road network planning, lagging traffic signal control, and incomplete intelligent transportation systems all lead to inefficient traffic flow. From a policy perspective, the lagging development of public transportation, lax parking management policies, and unscientific traffic restrictions also affect public travel choices. From a social perspective, public travel habits, the rise of the sharing economy, and the pursuit of travel convenience also deeply impact traffic efficiency.</p>
            <h3>Multi-dimensional Paths to Solve Traffic Congestion</h3>
            <p>Addressing traffic congestion requires coordinated efforts from technology, policy, and society, as single technological breakthroughs are insufficient.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intelligent transportation systems are the key technological means to solve traffic congestion.</strong> Through big data, artificial intelligence, and IoT technology, dynamic traffic signal adjustments, real-time road condition monitoring, and optimized vehicle routes can enhance traffic efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimizing urban planning is a long-term solution to traffic congestion.</strong> By adopting a "transit-oriented development" (TOD) model, urban development can revolve around public transport hubs, reducing reliance on private cars.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting green travel and strengthening public transportation construction are also crucial.</strong> Governments should increase investment in public transportation, promote the普及 of green travel methods, and encourage the public to choose public transportation, cycling, and walking.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Roles and Collaborative Governance of Government, Enterprises, and the Public</h3>
            <p>The governance of traffic congestion is a complex systemic project that requires the joint participation and collaborative efforts of the government, enterprises, and the public.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The government plays a leading role in traffic congestion governance,</strong> needing to formulate scientific traffic policies, promote the development of intelligent transportation systems, and strengthen management and restrictions on private vehicles.</li>
                <li><strong>Enterprises also play an important role in traffic congestion governance,</strong> driving progress in intelligent transportation systems through technological innovation and contributing to green travel and public transportation construction.</li>
                <li><strong>The public, as the ultimate beneficiaries of traffic congestion governance,</strong> need to change traditional travel habits and choose more green travel methods, thereby collectively building an efficient and green transportation system.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>From "capillaries" to "super nodes," intelligent technologies are reshaping transportation networks with unprecedented force, driving the transformation and upgrading of urban spaces. Transportation hubs, as the "super nodes" of the city, have undergone profound changes in function and spatial form through the application of big data, artificial intelligence, and 5G technology. However, solving traffic congestion issues not only requires technological breakthroughs but also policy optimization and social collaboration. Only through collaborative governance can an efficient, green, and sustainable transportation system be built, providing a solid guarantee for the healthy development of cities.</p>
