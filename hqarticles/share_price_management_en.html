            <h2>The Impact of Sentiment Analysis, ESG Factors, and Behavioral Finance on Stock Price Management in the Big Data Era</h2>
            <p>In the digital era of information overload, stock market dynamics are no longer driven solely by traditional financial data but are profoundly influenced by various emerging factors. Sentiment analysis, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors, and principles of behavioral finance together form a new perspective on modern corporate stock price management. These elements not only reflect changes in contemporary investor focus and decision-making patterns but also provide companies with a new strategy to manage stock price volatility.</p>

            <h3>Sentiment Analysis and Social Media Influence</h3>
            <p>**Sentiment analysis** as a product of big data analytics and natural language processing has become a crucial tool for understanding and predicting market dynamics. By monitoring and analyzing the sentiment on social media, companies can capture real-time public attitudes towards their brand, products, or events:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Collection and Analysis:</strong> Collecting relevant data from platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Weibo, preprocessing and feature extraction, and using machine learning algorithms for sentiment classification.</li>
                <li><strong>Direct and Indirect Impact on Stock Prices:</strong> Positive or negative sentiment on social media can directly affect investor buy/sell decisions and indirectly change company image and consumer behavior, thus influencing stock prices.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Companies can employ several strategies using sentiment analysis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-time Monitoring and Alert:</strong> Establish systems to provide early warnings of negative sentiment, enabling timely public relations actions.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjusting PR and Marketing Strategies:</strong> Adjust product launches or marketing campaigns based on sentiment analysis to leverage a positive public opinion environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Investor Relations Management:</strong> Enhance investor confidence through transparent communication, reducing market volatility.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>Companies can develop strategies to address these behavioral biases:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Stock Buybacks and Dividend Policies:</strong> Reduce outstanding shares through buybacks to increase earnings per share; attract income-focused investors through dividends to stabilize stock prices.</li>
                <li><strong>Marketing and Investor Relations:</strong> Through education and emotional management, reduce irrational behavior, promoting rational decision-making.</li>
            </ul>
