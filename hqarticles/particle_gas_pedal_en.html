            <h3>The Future of Energy Research</h3>
            <p>The application of particle accelerators in future energy research demonstrates their potential in exploring new forms of energy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dark Matter Research</strong>: By simulating early cosmic conditions, particle accelerators can detect interactions between dark matter and ordinary matter, infer the properties of dark matter, and possibly convert it into new energy forms, which could revolutionize future energy supply.</li>
                <li><strong>Antimatter and Energy</strong>: The annihilation of antimatter with matter releases enormous energy. Although currently expensive to produce, future large-scale production via particle accelerators could be applied in scenarios requiring high energy density, like space travel or energy supply in extreme environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Simulating the Early Universe</strong>: By recreating the physical processes post-Big Bang, scientists might discover new physical laws, inspire new energy conversion technologies, and drive changes in the energy sector.</li>
            </ul>
