            <h2>Potential of Nuclear Fusion Energy</h2>
            <p>Nuclear fusion is a process that releases enormous energy by combining light atomic nuclei (such as deuterium and tritium) into heavier nuclei. Unlike nuclear fission, nuclear fusion reactions do not produce radioactive waste, and the fuel sources are abundant. Deuterium, the main fuel for nuclear fusion, is almost inexhaustible in seawater. It is estimated that the deuterium in the Earth's seawater is enough to meet global energy needs for hundreds of millions of years.</p>

            <h2>Technical and Economic Challenges</h2>
            <p>Although the prospects for nuclear fusion energy are encouraging, achieving its commercial application still faces significant technical and economic challenges. Current nuclear fusion experimental devices, such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), have not yet achieved net energy gain in their energy output. The construction and maintenance costs of ITER are astronomical, expected to cost tens of billions of dollars. Additionally, the material endurance and long-term stable operation of nuclear fusion reactors are issues that need to be overcome. High-temperature plasma erosion and radiation damage to the reactor's inner wall materials are key factors affecting the reactor's lifespan.</p>
