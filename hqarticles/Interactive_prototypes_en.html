            <h2>From "People-Centered" to "Scenario-Centered": The Shift to Contextual Interaction Design</h2>
            <p>Under the impetus of the digital wave, the field of user experience design is undergoing a profound transformation. The traditional "people-centered" design philosophy has long dominated the mindset of interaction design, but its limitations have increasingly become apparent in the face of rapid technological advancements and the growing complexity of user needs. Today, design thinking is shifting from the static "people-centered" approach to a more dynamic, contextual "scenario-centered" approach. At the same time, the role of users is evolving from passive recipients to active participants, forming a new "bi-directional co-creation" design model. This shift not only reshapes the way designers work but also offers users more intelligent, flexible, and personalized experiences.</p>

            <h3>I. From "People-Centered" to "Scenario-Centered": The Shift to Contextual Interaction Design</h3>
            <p>The "people-centered" design philosophy was once considered the golden rule of user experience design, with its core focus on understanding user behavior patterns to construct information architectures, interface designs, and interaction flows that meet user needs. However, as user needs diversify and technology becomes more complex, this static design method has gradually shown its limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The rigidity of static design</strong>: In a constantly changing real-world context, user needs are not static but dynamically adjust based on factors such as time, location, and mood. Static design methods often fail to capture these nuances, resulting in rigid solutions that lack flexibility in practical applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Neglect of multi-dimensional contextual influences</strong>: User behavior is influenced not only by individual preferences but also by various contextual factors such as time, place, device, and emotion. Traditional design methods often ignore the complex interplay of these contextual factors, leading to solutions that struggle to meet diverse user needs in real-world applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of personalized needs</strong>: As user groups become increasingly diverse, the cultural backgrounds, cognitive levels, and usage habits of different users vary significantly. Traditional design methods struggle to effectively meet these personalized needs, resulting in fragmented and inconsistent user experiences.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Breaking the Static Barrier: Design and Implementation of Dynamic Interaction Prototypes</h3>
            <p>Guided by the "scenario-centered" design philosophy, interaction design is no longer confined to static interface layouts but shifts toward more dynamic and flexible interaction experiences. The core of dynamic interaction lies in real-time user-system interaction, breaking the traditional one-way flow of information and transforming cold interfaces into dynamic, personalized information flows.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Synergy of contextual thinking and behavior data</strong>: Placing users in specific scenarios to simulate real-world usage processes, deeply understanding user needs and pain points at different stages.</li>
                <li><strong>Building natural and smooth interaction experiences</strong>: Dynamic interactions should aim to simplify user operations and reduce cognitive load.</li>
                <li><strong>Iterative optimization for excellence</strong>: Leveraging modern design tools, designers can quickly build dynamic interaction prototypes and conduct usability testing within their teams.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>III. From "One-Way Output" to "Bi-Directional Co-Creation": The Rise of User-Collaborative Design Models</h3>
            <p>In traditional product design processes, designers often hold the dominant position, while users are in the passive role of acceptance. With the advancement of internet technology and the evolution of user experience philosophy, interaction design is undergoing a transformation from "one-way output" to "bi-directional co-creation." The user-collaborative design model emphasizes active user participation in the product design process, with designers and users co-creating products to better meet user needs and enhance product experiences.</p>

            <h3>IV. Future Outlook: The Integration of Contextual Design and User Collaboration</h3>
            <p>Looking ahead, interaction design will place greater emphasis on the deep integration of contextual design and user collaboration. With the continuous development of technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things, designers will be able to more accurately capture user needs in different scenarios. Through dynamic interactions and user collaboration, they will create more intelligent, personalized, and human-centric product experiences.</p>
