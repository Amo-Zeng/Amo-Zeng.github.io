            <h2>Transformation of the Drug Safety Governance System</h2>
            <p>Drug safety, as a major issue concerning public health and social stability, has always garnered extensive attention. The traditional drug regulatory model, with the government as the sole subject, has played a significant role historically. However, with the increasingly complex drug safety situation, its limitations have gradually become apparent. The single regulatory model faces challenges such as limited regulatory resources, information asymmetry, and inefficiency, making it difficult to address the diverse issues in the drug safety field. Therefore, constructing a drug safety governance system with multiple parties participating and cooperating in governance has become an inevitable trend in modern drug regulation.</p>

            <h3>From "Single Regulation" to "Social Co-Governance": A Profound Change in Ideology</h3>
            <p>Transitioning from "single regulation" to "social co-governance" is not merely an addition of regulatory subjects but a shift from traditional government-led management to a diversified governance model. The core of this shift is to build a new drug safety governance framework involving the government, enterprises, medical institutions, social organizations, and the public. This model not only emphasizes the integration and sharing of resources from all parties but also focuses on forming complementary advantages among different entities, thereby achieving comprehensive and multilevel drug safety governance.</p>

            <h3>From "Data Silos" to "Data Intelligence": The Technological Revolution in Drug Regulation</h3>
            <p>In the context of globalization, drug regulation faces unprecedented challenges. The traditional regulatory model, primarily based on isolated administrative approvals, has serious deficiencies in data collection, processing, and utilization, making it difficult to address increasingly complex drug safety issues. Digital transformation is reshaping the technological foundation of drug regulation, driving the regulatory system from "data silos" to "data intelligence." This transition not only brings fundamental changes to regulatory ideologies, methods, and models but also opens a new chapter in drug regulation.</p>

            <h4>"Data Silos": The Dilemma of Traditional Drug Regulation</h4>
            <p>The traditional drug regulatory model exhibits typical hierarchical characteristics, with departmental data scattered across vertically managed systems, lacking horizontal connections and sharing mechanisms. This "chimney-style" management approach leads to fragmented regulatory information, inconsistent standards, and lagging updates, making it difficult to form a complete regulatory chain. The limitations in data collection are also a prominent manifestation of "data silos." Regulatory authorities primarily rely on enterprise reporting and sampling inspections to obtain data, which not only has limited sample sizes but also significant lag, making it difficult to achieve early warning and precise prevention of drug safety risks.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>Digital Transformation: An Inevitable Choice for Drug Regulation</h4>
            <p>Under the impetus of information technology, drug regulation is undergoing profound digital transformation. Technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and blockchain are reshaping the regulatory technology foundation, providing new possibilities for resolving the "data silos" dilemma. Digital transformation is not just an innovation in technical means but a fundamental shift in regulatory ideologies and models. A new regulatory paradigm is emerging, shifting from passive regulation to proactive prevention, from empirical judgment to data-driven decision-making, and from point-based governance to systemic governance.</p>

        <section>
            <h4>Building "Data Intelligence": A New Vision for Drug Regulation</h4>
            <p>Data element governance is the foundation for building "data intelligence." A unified data standard and exchange platform need to be established to break down departmental barriers and achieve data interconnection. Intelligent analysis applications are the core of "data intelligence," using technologies such as machine learning and deep learning to establish drug safety risk warning models for precise regulation. Regulatory ecosystem reconstruction is the goal of "data intelligence," through opening data interfaces and involving social forces in regulation, establishing a multi-party governance regulatory ecosystem.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Building a Multi-Party Participatory Drug Safety Governance System</h3>
            <p>Building a multi-party participatory drug safety governance system is a systemic transformation concerning public health and well-being. It requires joint efforts from the government, enterprises, medical institutions, social organizations, and the public, as well as digital transformation and technological innovation to drive fundamental changes in regulatory models. Only by forming a concerted effort can we truly achieve social co-governance in drug safety, safeguarding the life and health of the people.</p>
