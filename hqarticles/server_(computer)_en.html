                <li><strong>Game Server Stuttering, Player Attrition:</strong> A popular online multiplayer game experienced frequent stuttering due to server performance issues, resulting in a 30% player attrition rate within a month and directly impacting revenue.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Solutions: Optimizing Servers to Enhance User Experience</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Choosing Appropriate Server Hardware:</strong> Select high-performance servers or cloud servers based on business needs, dynamically adjusting resource allocation to avoid overload or waste.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimizing Server Configuration:</strong> Enhance website and application responsiveness through load balancing, caching technology, and CDN acceleration.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Security and Backup:</strong> Implement multi-layered security measures and regular data backups to ensure user data security and business continuity.</li>
            </ol>
