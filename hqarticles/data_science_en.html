        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Algorithmic Bias: Social Inequality Under Digital Rationality</h3>
            <p>Algorithms, the core driving force of data science, are believed to process information objectively and impartially to derive optimal solutions. Yet, reality repeatedly demonstrates that algorithms are not "neutral"; they often inherit and amplify biases and discrimination inherent in their designers and training data. For instance, certain crime prediction algorithms have been accused of being biased against minority ethnic groups, while some hiring systems have been questioned for their unfriendliness towards female job applicants.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Incompleteness and insufficient representativeness of data</strong>: The training data relied upon by algorithms is often a collection of past experiences or historical data, which may contain social biases and inequalities.</li>
                <li><strong>Limitations in algorithm design and optimization objectives</strong>: Algorithm designers often incorporate specific value orientations, objective functions, and constraints into the design, leading to biases.</li>
                <li><strong>Limitations of human cognition and judgment</strong>: Although algorithms can process vast amounts of data, they still rely on human cognition and judgment to define problems, build models, and interpret results, which inevitably affects algorithm performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Algorithmic bias is not just a technical issue but also a social issue. It undermines social fairness and justice, exacerbates social inequality, and may even deprive certain groups of development opportunities.</p>

            <h3>Data Privacy: The博弈Between Individual Rights and Data Value</h3>
            <p>Data, the foundation of data science and the source of data value, is facing unprecedented challenges and risks under the drive of data value. Large-scale data collection and analysis expose personal privacy to increasingly complex and uncontrollable environments, with data breaches, misuse, and侵权occurring frequently.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Risk of personal privacy leakage</strong>: As the breadth and depth of data collection continue to increase, the risk of personal privacy information leakage also grows, potentially leading to identity theft and financial fraud.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk of data misuse and discrimination</strong>: Personal data may be used for improper purposes, such as price discrimination and targeted advertising, or even to manipulate public opinion and influence election results.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk of data hegemony and monopoly</strong>: A few tech giants control vast amounts of user data, forming data hegemony, which may lead to market monopolies and innovation suppression.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Data privacy issues not only concern individual rights but also affect social fairness and justice and the equitable distribution of data value. How to balance personal privacy protection and the reasonable utilization of data value is a significant challenge in the data era.</p>
