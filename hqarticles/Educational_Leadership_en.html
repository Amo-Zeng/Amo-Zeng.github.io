            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the context of the rapid development of digital technology, the field of education is undergoing profound transformation. Students, teachers, parents, and school administrators have become "digital natives," and their symbiotic relationship with digital technology is redefining the boundaries of education. At the same time, traditional models of educational leadership are facing unprecedented challenges. From single "results-oriented" management to diverse "growth mindset" leadership, and then to multi-stakeholder "co-creative leadership" models, educational leaders need to continuously adapt and drive this transformation. This article will explore the transformation and practice paths of new era educational leadership from three levels: the cultivation of digital leadership, the practice of growth mindset, and the construction of co-creative leadership, with the aim of providing theoretical support and practical guidance for the transformation of the education sector.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>1. The Cultivation of Digital Leadership: From Technology Application to Strategic Leadership</h2>
            <p>The development of digital technology not only changes the way education is presented but also imposes new demands on the role of educational leaders. Traditional educational leaders are often limited to the use of technology, while new era educational leaders need to transition from "users of digital technology" to "strategic leaders in the digital era," cultivating comprehensive digital leadership.</p>
            <h3>1. Data-Driven Decision Making</h3>
            <p>Educational leaders in the digital era need strong data analysis capabilities to make scientific decisions based on data. By building an educational data platform, schools can track student learning progress, teacher teaching effectiveness, and management efficiency in real-time. For example, through the data collected by the Learning Management System (LMS), leaders can analyze students' learning behavior patterns, identify potential learning difficulties, and provide personalized support. At the same time, leaders also need to pay attention to data privacy and ethical issues to ensure the security and lawful use of student data. This data-driven decision-making approach not only improves the scientific nature of decision-making but also provides a solid foundation for personalized education.</p>
            <h3>2. Optimization of Digital Management Processes</h3>
            <p>Digital technology offers new possibilities for the optimization of school management processes. Educational leaders can simplify management processes and improve work efficiency by introducing online office systems, automated attendance tools, and intelligent scheduling systems. For example, through an online attendance system, schools can monitor teachers' attendance in real-time, reducing errors in manual statistics; through an intelligent scheduling system, schools can automatically generate reasonable course arrangements, avoiding time conflicts. These digital tools can not only enhance management efficiency but also support personalized learning and efficient decision-making. Additionally, the optimization of digital management processes can reduce human errors and improve management transparency and fairness.</p>
            <h3>3. A Leadership Style of Open Collaboration</h3>
            <p>In the digital era, students, teachers, and parents demand higher levels of transparency and participation in information. Educational leaders should maintain interaction with stakeholders through open communication channels. For example, schools can establish online forums where parents and students can participate in policy discussions and provide suggestions and opinions. This open leadership style not only enhances the credibility of the school but also promotes deep integration between the school and the community. Moreover, the style of open collaboration can stimulate the creativity and participation enthusiasm of teachers and students, driving the innovation and development of school culture.</p>

            <h2>2. From "Focusing on Results" to "Focusing on Growth": The Practice of Growth Mindset</h2>
            <p>In traditional education systems, indicators such as college admission rates and exam scores are often regarded as core standards for measuring educational quality. However, this "results-oriented" thinking model overlooks the overall growth of students and teachers. New era educational leaders need to shift from "focusing on results" to "focusing on growth," guided by a growth mindset, to promote the comprehensive development of students and teachers in emotional, social, and cognitive aspects.</p>
            <h3>1. Building a School Culture that Supports Innovation and Risk-Taking</h3>
            <p>Growth mindset emphasizes that failure is an important part of learning and growth. Educational leaders should encourage a school culture that embraces failure, celebrates progress, and provides resource support. For example, schools can establish "Growth Awards" to recognize teachers and students who have made significant progress in their learning or teaching, rather than only rewarding those who have already excelled. This culture can not only stimulate the innovative spirit of teachers and students but also help them accumulate experience from failures and achieve continuous growth.</p>
            <h3>2. Promoting Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Diverse Development</h3>
            <p>A growth-oriented school culture should also encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and diverse development. Educational leaders can help students find their interests and strengths in different fields by breaking down disciplinary barriers and supporting diverse development. For example, schools can introduce virtual reality (VR) technology to provide immersive learning experiences; they can also use online platforms to offer language learning support for students from different backgrounds. This interdisciplinary collaboration and diverse development can not only broaden students' horizons but also cultivate their comprehensive qualities and innovative abilities.</p>
            <h3>3. Designing a Growth-Oriented Evaluation System</h3>
            <p>Traditional evaluation systems rely too heavily on summative assessments, ignoring the growth trajectory of students during the learning process. Educational leaders can focus on students' learning processes and actual abilities through formative and performance-based assessments. For example, through classroom observation, peer evaluation, and project-based learning, schools can more comprehensively reflect students' abilities and competencies, helping them receive support in weak areas and further development in their strengths. This evaluation system can not only promote the overall growth of students but also provide feedback for teachers' teaching, driving the improvement of teaching quality.</p>

            <h2>3. From "Single Leader" to "Co-Creative Leader": Building Multi-Stakeholder School Governance</h2>
            <p>In the era of digital transformation and the knowledge economy, the traditional "heroic" leadership model is facing challenges. The future development of schools will place greater emphasis on collaboration and co-creation. Educational leaders need to transition from "single decision-makers" to "co-creative facilitators," working together with teachers, students, parents, and other stakeholders to participate in school development.</p>
            <h3>1. Flattened, Participatory School Organizational Structure</h3>
            <p>Traditional pyramid-style school organizational structures have clear hierarchies and low information transfer efficiency. Educational leaders can build a flattened, participatory school organizational structure by reducing management levels, granting teachers more autonomy, and establishing effective communication mechanisms. For example, schools can create interdisciplinary teams and project groups to allow teachers and students to participate in school affairs more flexibly. This flattened organizational structure can not only improve decision-making efficiency but also enhance the sense of participation and belonging among teachers and students.</p>
            <h3>2. Cultivating Students' Leadership</h3>
            <p>Students are the masters of the school, and cultivating students' leadership is not only necessary for enhancing their future competitiveness but also an intrinsic driving force for school development. Educational leaders can help students practice leadership skills such as planning, resource coordination, and problem-solving through project-based learning, student councils, and leadership courses. This leadership development not only enhances students' comprehensive qualities but also injects new vitality into the sustainable development of the school.</p>
            <h3>3. Multi-Stakeholder School Governance Mechanism</h3>
            <p>The development of schools depends on the support of various stakeholders. Educational leaders can establish a multi-stakeholder school governance mechanism through home-school cooperation, community participation, and social oversight. For example, schools can set up parent committees to encourage parents to participate in school activities and decision-making; they can also utilize community resources to provide students with richer learning experiences. This multi-stakeholder governance mechanism can not only enhance the cohesion of the school but also provide diversified support for school development.</p>
