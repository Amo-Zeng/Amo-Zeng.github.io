            <p>With the deepening wave of global digitalization, the demand for computing has experienced unprecedented explosive growth. The traditional centralized cloud computing architecture, while facing this challenge, has gradually exposed numerous bottlenecks, such as network latency, high bandwidth costs, and data privacy and security issues. At the same time, enterprises seeking efficient development, data-driven decision-making, and intelligent operations have increasingly demanded new computing paradigms. Against this backdrop, edge computing, Serverless architecture, and data fabric technologies have emerged as key paths to solving these problems. However, these technologies are still in their infancy, and how to organically integrate them to build a new paradigm of efficient collaboration and intelligent-driven computing has become a core issue that needs urgent resolution.</p>

            <h3>Limitations of Traditional Computing Models and the Rise of Emerging Technologies</h3>
            <h4>Cloud Computing Bottlenecks and the Rise of Edge Computing</h4>
            <p>Traditional cloud computing architectures centralize a large amount of computing, storage, and network resources in data centers. While this highly centralized model has clear advantages in resource management, cost-effectiveness, and economies of scale, it also brings a series of issues. First, with the surge in data volume and increased demand for real-time performance, network latency and bandwidth bottlenecks have become critical factors limiting cloud performance. Second, data privacy and security issues have become increasingly prominent, especially in applications involving sensitive data, where centralized storage and processing pose significant security risks. Additionally, the rapid growth of edge devices has made centralized management models difficult to handle, and the rise of edge computing aims to address these challenges.</p>
            <p>Edge computing reduces network latency, lowers bandwidth costs, and enhances real-time data processing and security by bringing computing tasks closer to the data source. However, edge computing still faces several challenges: the heterogeneity and resource constraints of edge devices make unified resource management and scheduling mechanisms difficult to achieve; the collaborative capabilities between edge nodes are insufficient, making it challenging to build an efficient distributed computing network; the mechanisms for data circulation and sharing between the cloud and edge are not well-established, and data security and privacy protection remain urgent issues to address.</p>
            <h4>Limitations and Breakthroughs in Serverless Architecture</h4>
            <p>Traditional Serverless architectures, centered around Functions as a Service (FaaS), allow developers to focus solely on business logic without managing underlying infrastructure. This model significantly simplifies the development process and improves resource utilization but has several limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Development Threshold:</strong> Functional programming models require high abstraction capabilities from developers and make it difficult to reuse existing application code and frameworks, increasing development complexity.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Resource Utilization:</strong> The short lifespan and cold start issues of functions result in low resource utilization, with performance bottlenecks particularly evident when handling complex tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Difficulty Supporting Complex Applications:</strong> Individual functions struggle to carry the logic of complex applications, particularly in microservice architectures, where collaboration and communication between functions pose significant challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>High Operational Complexity:</strong> The vast number of dispersed functions are difficult to manage effectively with traditional operational tools, increasing the complexity of monitoring, logging, and troubleshooting.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To overcome these limitations, "application-centric" Serverless platforms have emerged, focusing on providing comprehensive support throughout the application lifecycle, integrating development and operations for holistic management.</p>
            <h4>Data Silo Dilemmas and Challenges of Data Fabric</h4>
            <p>Traditional enterprise data management often exists in the form of data silos, with data from different departments, systems, and applications isolated and difficult to integrate and share. Although data integration technologies have made significant progress in recent years, traditional methods still face numerous challenges in increasingly complex data environments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Heterogeneity:</strong> Enterprises have diverse data sources, including structured, unstructured, real-time, and historical data, with varying formats, semantics, and storage methods, increasing integration complexity.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Scale:</strong> The explosive growth of data has made traditional manual integration and batch processing models unable to handle massive real-time processing needs, leading to low data integration efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Security and Privacy:</strong> Ensuring data security and privacy during sharing and circulation, and preventing sensitive information leakage, are critical challenges for enterprises.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Value Extraction:</strong> Data silos and integration complexity limit widespread data utilization, making it difficult to achieve global insights and intelligent decision-making.</li>
            </ul>
