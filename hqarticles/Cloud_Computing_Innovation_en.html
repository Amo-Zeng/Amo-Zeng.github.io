            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Propelled by the digital wave, the volume of data is growing explosively, and the demand for computing power is increasing dramatically. Traditional cloud computing, although excellent in handling large-scale data, has shown limitations when faced with low-latency, high-real-time, and efficient application scenarios. To address these challenges, emerging technologies such as edge intelligence collaborative computing, blockchain-based distributed cloud computing platforms, and on-demand customized cloud resource supermarkets have emerged as new solutions for modern computing needs. The integration of these technologies not only demonstrates significant advantages in their respective fields but also collectively drives the future development of cloud computing through synergistic effects.</p>

            <h3>Innovation: Deep Integration of Edge Computing and Cloud Computing</h3>
            <h4>Breaking Traditional Models</h4>
            <p>Traditional cloud computing models centralize data processing and storage in cloud data centers, with edge devices serving merely as data collection points. Although this approach leverages the powerful computing and storage capabilities of the cloud, it has issues such as network latency, bandwidth consumption, and data privacy in scenarios requiring high real-time performance.</p>
            <p>Edge intelligence collaborative computing breaks this traditional model by deeply integrating cloud computing with edge computing. The cloud provides strong computing power and massive storage, while the edge leverages local computing resources and low-latency advantages for real-time data processing and intelligent decision-making. This collaborative computing mode not only improves data processing efficiency but also reduces network bandwidth consumption and data transmission costs, enhancing data privacy and security.</p>
            <h4>Application Scenarios</h4>
            <h5>Smart Home</h5>
            <p>In smart home applications, the cloud can analyze user behavior data, while edge devices execute personalized recommendations and controls based on the cloud's analysis. For example, a smart speaker can automatically play favorite music at specific times based on user habits; a smart light bulb can automatically adjust brightness and color temperature according to the user's schedule.</p>
            <h5>Smart Cities</h5>
            <p>In smart city applications, the cloud processes massive urban-level data, while edge computing nodes implement real-time traffic flow prediction and traffic light control based on the cloud's analysis. For example, when congestion occurs at an intersection, the edge computing node can adjust the duration of traffic lights in real-time to alleviate congestion and improve traffic efficiency.</p>
            <h5>Industrial Internet</h5>
            <p>In the industrial internet, the cloud can predict equipment failures and optimize production capacity, while the edge monitors production line status in real-time and issues failure warnings. For example, on a factory production line, edge devices can collect equipment operation data in real-time and send it to the cloud for analysis. When the cloud predicts a potential equipment failure, the edge device can immediately issue a warning, prompting engineers to perform maintenance and prevent production interruptions and equipment damage.</p>

            <h3>Innovation: Blockchain Technology Integration</h3>
            <h4>Building a Secure and Trustworthy Distributed Environment</h4>
            <p>Traditional centralized cloud computing platforms rely on a single data center or cloud service provider, making the entire system vulnerable to single points of failure and data leaks. Blockchain-based distributed cloud computing platforms distribute computing resources across multiple nodes, leveraging blockchain's decentralized characteristics to avoid single points of failure and enhance system reliability and security.</p>
            <p>Blockchain's immutable properties ensure data integrity and credibility. All computing tasks and data processing procedures are recorded on the blockchain, and any attempts to tamper with data are identified and rejected by the system, ensuring data transparency and security.</p>
            <h4>Application Scenarios</h4>
            <h5>Decentralized Applications (DApps)</h5>
            <p>Decentralized applications (DApps) rely on distributed computing resources for efficient operation. Blockchain-based distributed cloud computing platforms provide DApps with powerful computing and storage resources, ensuring their stable operation in a decentralized environment. For example, decentralized finance applications (DeFi) need to process large amounts of transaction data and smart contract execution, and distributed cloud computing platforms can provide the necessary computing resources to ensure system efficiency and security.</p>
            <h5>Data Ownership and Trading</h5>
            <p>Blockchain-based distributed cloud computing platforms can record data ownership and usage rights on the blockchain, enabling secure data trading and sharing. For example, in the medical field, patients' health data can be authenticated via the blockchain, ensuring that data ownership and usage rights are used only within authorized limits. Data can be traded and shared through the blockchain platform, promoting the circulation and utilization of medical data.</p>
            <h5>Crowdsourcing Cloud Computing Services</h5>
            <p>Individuals and businesses can contribute idle computing resources and receive corresponding revenue through the blockchain platform. This not only improves the utilization rate of computing resources but also provides individuals and businesses with new sources of income. For example, research institutions can contribute their idle computing resources to the blockchain platform, providing computing services to other users and receiving corresponding revenue.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Innovation: Resource Segmentation and Standardization</h3>
            <h4>Resource Segmentation</h4>
            <p>Traditional cloud services typically allocate resources in units of virtual machines (VMs) or containers (Containers), making it difficult for users to adjust resources at a granular level based on specific needs. On-demand customized cloud resource supermarkets segment resources at a granular level, allowing users to flexibly select and combine these resources based on actual needs. For example, a user requiring a combination of low CPU and high memory can choose a flexible resource combination from the on-demand resource supermarket.</p>
            <h4>Standardization</h4>
            <p>To ensure users can easily select and combine resources, on-demand customized cloud resource supermarkets handle resources through standardization. Each type of resource is given standardized specifications and pricing, allowing users to intuitively select the required resource combinations through a simple interface. This standardized resource management method not only simplifies the user selection process but also enhances resource transparency and controllability.</p>
            <h4>Application Scenarios</h4>
            <h5>Startups</h5>
            <p>On-demand customized cloud resource supermarkets provide flexible resource acquisition methods for startups. Enterprises can flexibly adjust computing resources according to different stages of business development, from initial low-cost resource combinations to high-performance resource configurations post-business expansion, achieving on-demand resource scaling.</p>
            <h5>Research Institutions</h5>
            <p>Research institutions often require different types of computing resources for scientific computing and data analysis. On-demand customized cloud resource supermarkets can provide suitable resource combinations based on different research project needs. For example, for projects requiring large amounts of computing resources like gene sequencing, research institutions can choose high-performance CPU and storage combinations; for projects requiring large-scale data analysis, they can choose high-memory and high-speed network resource combinations.</p>
            <h5>Individual Developers</h5>
            <p>On-demand customized cloud resource supermarkets provide low-cost resource acquisition methods for individual developers. Developers can choose appropriate resource combinations based on project requirements for application development and testing. For example, individual developers can select lower-cost resource combinations during the development phase for code writing and unit testing, and choose higher-performance resource combinations during the online testing phase to ensure stable application operation.</p>
