            <h3>Technological Challenges of Quantum Computing: Stability of Qubits and Quantum Error Correction</h3>
            <p>Despite the enormous potential of quantum computing, its development still faces many technological challenges. Among these, the stability of qubits and quantum error correction are the core issues in the field of quantum computing.</p>
            <h4>Stability of Qubits</h4>
            <p>Qubits are the basic computational units of quantum computers and determine the significant advantages of quantum computers in solving certain complex problems. However, qubits are extremely fragile and susceptible to environmental noise and external interference, leading to computational errors or data loss. This fragility is a key bottleneck in the development of quantum computing.</p>
            <p>To address the stability issue of qubits, scientists are exploring various technological solutions. For example, superconducting qubits are one of the most widely researched technologies. By using superconducting materials at extremely low temperatures, superconducting qubits can effectively reduce the impact of environmental noise, thereby improving stability. Additionally, topological qubits are gaining attention due to their stronger resistance to interference. Topological qubits leverage the properties of topological materials to withstand external interference to some extent, thereby enhancing the reliability of quantum computing.</p>
            <h4>Quantum Error Correction</h4>
            <p>Quantum error correction is another critical technological challenge in quantum computing. Due to the fragility of qubits, quantum computers are prone to computational errors in practical applications. To ensure the accuracy of computational results, quantum computers need to possess robust error correction capabilities. Quantum error correction detects and corrects errors during quantum computation through redundant coding and error correction codes.</p>
            <p>However, the development and implementation of quantum error correction technology are highly complex. Currently, quantum error correction codes require a large number of additional qubits, which not only increases the complexity of quantum computers but also raises their costs. For instance, implementing an efficient quantum error correction code may require thousands of qubits, far exceeding the current practical capabilities of quantum computers. Therefore, scientists are working to develop more efficient quantum error correction technologies to enable reliable quantum computing with limited qubits.</p>
            <h4>Scalability and Programmability</h4>
