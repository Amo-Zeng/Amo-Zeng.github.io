            <h2>The Future Restructuring of AI, Food Culture, and Regional Cooperation</h2>
            <p>Traditional research on regional cooperation often focuses on economic coordination, supply chain integration, and mutual policy recognition. However, as artificial intelligence, data infrastructure, and cultural symbol systems become increasingly intertwined, the boundaries of regional cooperation are expanding from “economic geography” to a composite of “cultural identity” and “institutional trust.” This article explores how AI reshapes the future logic of regional food cooperation from three new perspectives.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>1. “Flavor Geopolitics” – Food Culture as Soft Infrastructure for Regional Cooperation</h3>
            <p>AI is deconstructing and redefining the concept and dissemination routes of local food culture, transforming it into “soft infrastructure” for interregional cooperation and building bridges of identity between unconventional partners.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>AI algorithms analyze regional taste preferences to create “flavor maps” that promote the branding and export of local specialty foods.</li>
                <li>Digitalized taste identity makes “flavor proximity” potentially more powerful than “geographic proximity” as a new cooperation benchmark.</li>
                <li>Regions can establish cooperative trust through shared food culture symbols, forming “flavor alliances.”</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>2. “AI Taste Matching System” – Smart Demand-Supply Matching Driven by Sensory Needs</h3>
            <p>AI technology is extending from supply chain integration to deep sensory user insights, enabling precise cross-regional matching of supply and demand, breaking traditional dependencies on physical distribution channels.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using machine learning to analyze user taste data and build a “personalized regional food map.”</li>
                <li>Privacy-preserving techniques like federated learning allow for cross-regional user insights without centralizing data.</li>
                <li>Developing intelligent matching platforms from farms to tables, forming a demand-driven mechanism for regional food cooperation.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>3. “Institutional Trust Layer” – New Support for Regional Cooperation via Non-Economic Variables</h3>
            <p>Institutional design now goes beyond rule harmonization or legal alignment. It builds new “social trust” platforms via algorithm governance and data transparency, enhancing the sustainability of regional cooperation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trust can be quantified through data transparency, algorithm explainability, and platform openness as soft indicators for evaluating cooperation.</li>
                <li>AI-powered RegTech strengthens mutual food standard recognition and origin traceability across regions.</li>
                <li>“Cross-institutional learning” enables AI to assist in policy formulation and collaborative mechanism design for regional development.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In an era where AI is deeply integrated into economic and social structures, the core logic of regional cooperation is shifting—from “economic benefit sharing” toward “cultural identity building” and “institutional trust creation.” This is not only a result of technological development but also an evolutionary direction of human collaboration.</p>
