            <h2>The Deep-Rooted Causes of the Pollinator Crisis and Agricultural Dilemmas</h2>
            <p>The survival of pollinating insects worldwide is facing unprecedented threats. The widespread use of pesticides, habitat fragmentation, and the acceleration of climate change are collectively causing a sharp decline in the populations of key pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This decline not only jeopardizes the balance of ecosystems but also directly threatens global food security.</p>

            <h2>Pollinator-Friendly Agriculture: A Dual Revolution in Ecological Restoration and Pesticide Reduction</h2>
            <p>Pollinator-friendly agriculture is not merely a patchwork fix to traditional farming but a profound transformation from production methods to ecological principles. The core of this model lies in building "pollinator sanctuaries" to restore and enhance pollination services within agricultural ecosystems, achieving a win-win for both agricultural production and ecological protection.</p>

            <h2>Constructing Pollinator Sanctuaries: A Systematic Strategy from Shelter to Empowerment</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diverse Landscapes:</strong> By preserving or planting nectar-rich plants and wildflowers in fields, providing continuous food sources for pollinating insects.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Buffers:</strong> Planting windbreaks and hedgerows along field edges to offer pollinators safe havens.</li>
                <li><strong>Green Infrastructure:</strong> Building insect hotels and artificial nests to provide secure breeding sites for pollinators.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrated Pest Management:</strong> Using natural enemies and biological pesticides to reduce the use of chemical pesticides.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Education and Participation:</strong> Raising public awareness of the importance of pollinators and encouraging farmers and consumers to engage in pollinator-friendly agriculture.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>Pollinator Sanctuaries: Transitioning from Single Function to Multiple Ecological Services</h2>
            <p>Pollinator sanctuaries are not just refuges for pollinating insects; they are the starting point for the restoration and enhancement of biodiversity within agricultural ecosystems.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Ecological Pest Control: Returning from Pesticide Dependence to Natural Balance</h2>
            <p>The misuse of pesticides has not only led to environmental pollution and ecological imbalance but also poses potential threats to human health. The traditional methods of pest control urgently need innovation, and "ecological pest control" is at the heart of this transformation.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Advantages of the New Ecological Control Model: Holistic Improvement from Environment to Economy</h2>
            <p>The benefits of the ecological control model are not limited to environmental protection; they also bring profound impacts on the economic and social levels.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>From Table to Field: Reconstructing the Green Cycle of Modern Agriculture</h2>
            <p>The development of modern agriculture has significantly boosted food production but also led to excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, causing environmental pollution, soil degradation, and other issues. The "from table to field" pesticide reduction initiative is a consumer-driven push for a transformation in agricultural production methods.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion: The Future Vision of Pollinator-Friendly Agriculture</h2>
            <p>Pollinator-friendly agriculture not only offers a sustainable solution to reducing pesticides but also presents a promising vision of coexistence between agriculture and ecology.</p>
