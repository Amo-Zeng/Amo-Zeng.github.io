            <h2>Introduction to the Versatility of ATLAS</h2>
            <p>ATLAS, or A Toroidal LHC Apparatus, is a multi-purpose detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Initially designed to explore the unsolved mysteries of fundamental particle physics, its applications have now extended far beyond that scope. ATLAS is not only a pioneer in particle physics research but also serves as a core platform for interdisciplinary studies and cosmological exploration.</p>

            <h3>Contributions to Cosmological Detection</h3>
            <p>ATLAS helps scientists understand the origin and evolution of the universe by simulating early cosmic conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dark Matter Detection:</strong> ATLAS searches for supersymmetric particles or other unknown particles as candidates for dark matter. Although direct evidence has not been found, ATLAS experiments have excluded many theoretical models, significantly narrowing down the parameter space for dark matter.</li>
                <li><strong>Neutrino Physics:</strong> ATLAS participates in the search for neutrinoless double beta decay, which helps to determine the mass of neutrinos and whether they are their own antiparticles.</li>
                <li><strong>Cosmological Model Validation:</strong> Using ATLAS data, scientists can verify or challenge existing cosmological models like dark energy and theories of cosmic inflation.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Applications in High Energy Physics and Quantum Computing</h3>
            <p>ATLAS not only challenges computational limits with its data volume but also promotes the application of quantum computing in high-energy physics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Processing Capacity:</strong> Annually handling data from TB to PB levels, ATLAS uses complex trigger systems and globally distributed computing resources for real-time data collection and analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantum Computing Applications:</strong> ATLAS employs the parallel processing capabilities of quantum computing to simulate complex physical systems like quantum field theory, analyze data to uncover patterns not revealed by traditional methods, and optimize problem-solving strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantum Machine Learning:</strong> The ATLAS team explores techniques like quantum neural networks to classify and regress particle physics data, improving the efficiency and accuracy of data analysis.</li>
            </ul>
