                <li><strong>2. Technology Transfer to Enhance Energy Accessibility</strong><br>
                    The Energy International Cooperation Organization plays a crucial role in facilitating the transfer of renewable energy technologies from developed to developing countries. IRENA's "Renewable Energy Technology Transfer Mechanism" (RETM) provides technical training, capacity building, and financial support to developing countries, helping them overcome technical and financial barriers and achieve large-scale renewable energy applications. Through this technology transfer, the cooperation organization effectively narrows the gap in energy access, enabling more people in developing countries to enjoy clean and affordable energy services.</li>
                <li><strong>3. Building a Fair and Rational Global Energy Governance System</strong><br>
                    Energy democratization requires a fair, transparent, and inclusive global energy governance system as its foundation. The Energy International Cooperation Organization is particularly important in this area. For example, the International Energy Agency (IEA) regularly publishes the "World Energy Outlook" report, providing in-depth analysis and forecasts of global energy trends to inform national energy policy-making. Additionally, the cooperation organization actively promotes the participation of developing countries in global energy governance, enhancing their voice and decision-making power, thereby constructing a more equitable and reasonable international energy order.</li>

            <h3>II. New Challenges to Global Energy Security and Response Strategies</h3>
            <p>In today's profoundly changing global energy landscape, energy security is no longer confined to traditional notions of stable supply but has taken on a broader and more complex meaning. Climate change, geopolitical conflicts, and energy price fluctuations intertwine, presenting unprecedented challenges to global energy security. In this context, the Energy International Cooperation Organization must adopt more flexible and diverse strategies to address these new challenges.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1. Climate Change: The Urgency of Energy Transition</strong><br>
                    Climate change has become a significant threat to global energy security. The international community's efforts to combat climate change require nations to accelerate the low-carbon transformation of their energy structures. The Energy International Cooperation Organization must promote coordinated responses to climate change among member states while ensuring a smooth transition of energy supply. This involves not only technical cooperation but also the construction of policy coordination and economic incentive mechanisms to support the sustainable development of the global energy system.</li>
                <li><strong>2. Geopolitical Conflicts: Vulnerability of Energy Supply Chains</strong><br>
                    Geopolitical risks are one of the primary threats to energy security in recent years. Whether it's conflicts in the Middle East or power struggles over energy resources among major powers, they can lead to disruptions in energy supply. The Energy International Cooperation Organization needs to enhance strategic coordination among member states, diversify energy supply channels, reduce dependence on a single region or country, and improve the resilience and risk resistance of energy supply.</li>
                <li><strong>3. Strengthening Information Sharing and Strategic Coordination</strong><br>
                    In addressing new challenges to global energy security, information sharing and strategic coordination are essential. The Energy International Cooperation Organization can establish a global energy information sharing platform to monitor energy production, consumption, inventory, and price data in real time. Through information sharing, member states can respond more promptly to emergencies, avoiding supply disruptions or market panics due to information asymmetry.</li>
            </ul>
