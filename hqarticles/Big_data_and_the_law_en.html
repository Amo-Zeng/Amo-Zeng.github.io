            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>With the rapid development of digital technology, big data has become the core driving force of modern social transformation. However, this transformation not only reshapes the economic and social operation models but also poses unprecedented challenges to the existing legal system. The traditional legal framework is struggling to cope with the complex issues brought by big data, especially in the areas of data rights allocation, algorithm governance, and cross-border data flow. The lag of the law in comparison to the rapid iteration of data technology is particularly evident. This article will delve into the interaction between big data and the law from three dimensions: "from ownership to usage rights," "from outcome justice to process transparency," and "from single rules to pluralistic governance," and propose a reconceptualization of the legal framework to adapt to the new era.</p>

            <h2>I. Data Rights Allocation: From "Ownership" to "Usage Rights"</h2>
            <h3>1. Limitations of the Traditional "Ownership" Concept and the Characteristics of Big Data</h3>
            <p>In the era of big data, the characteristics of data—replicability, non-exclusivity, dynamism, and diversity—pose serious challenges to the traditional concept of "ownership." The value of data lies not in possession but in its use, flow, and enhancement. Multiple entities can simultaneously or sequentially use the same data, making the traditional static concept of "ownership" insufficient for the dynamic and real-time sharing needs of data. Moreover, the ownership of data is often ambiguous in practice, especially among personal data, corporate data, and public data.</p>
            <h3>2. The Connotation and Innovation of the "Usage Rights" Concept</h3>
            <p>The "usage rights" concept emphasizes the rights to use and benefit from data, rather than the rights to possess and control it. This concept not only aligns with the nature of data but also promotes data sharing and circulation, balancing the interests of various parties. For example, in the field of personal data protection, individuals can retain their "usage rights" over their data, authorizing data users to use the data within the scope of their consent while safeguarding personal privacy. This model can incentivize the lawful use of data while preventing its misuse.</p>
            <h3>3. Adjustment and Innovation in the Legal Framework</h3>
            <p>At the legal level, it is necessary to redefine the connotation of data rights, clarify the legal status of "usage rights," and incorporate them into the legal framework of data rights. Legislative measures should be taken to define the rights and obligations of data generators, collectors, users, and public interest entities, providing legal safeguards for the exercise of "usage rights." Additionally, a standardized "usage rights" trading mechanism should be established to protect the legitimate rights and interests of all parties involved in data transactions. Furthermore, new governance models such as data trusts and data banks should be explored to provide more possibilities for data sharing and circulation.</p>

            <h2>II. Algorithm Governance: From "Outcome Justice" to "Process Transparency"</h2>
            <h3>1. Limitations of the Traditional "Outcome Justice" Model and the Challenges of Algorithm Governance</h3>
            <p>In the era of big data, algorithms are increasingly applied in areas such as judicial decision-making, credit evaluation, and social governance. However, issues such as the "black-box effect," data hegemony, and algorithmic discrimination make the traditional "outcome justice" model increasingly untenable. Public skepticism about algorithmic fairness is growing, necessitating a shift towards a "process transparency" governance model. The traditional "outcome justice" model relies on reviewing the final results, neglecting the inner logic and process of algorithm operation, making it difficult to effectively identify and control the potential risks of algorithms.</p>
            <h3>2. Building a Process-Transparent Algorithm Governance Framework</h3>
            <p>To build a process-transparent algorithm governance framework, efforts should be made in areas such as algorithm transparency, interpretability, ethical norms, accountability mechanisms, and public participation. Algorithm developers and users should be required to disclose key information, promote the adoption of interpretable artificial intelligence technologies, formulate ethical guidelines, establish robust accountability mechanisms, and enhance public participation to ensure that algorithm operation processes are open, transparent, interpretable, and accountable. Additionally, a pluralistic participatory model for algorithm governance should be explored, with government, businesses, academia, and the public jointly participating in algorithm development and supervision, forming a multi-stakeholder collaborative governance structure.</p>
            <h3>3. Future Prospects for the Relationship Between Big Data and Law</h3>
            <p>The rapid development of big data technology presents both new opportunities and challenges for the law. By building a process-transparent algorithm governance framework, the risks posed by algorithms can be effectively addressed, and the positive role of big data in the legal field can be fully leveraged, promoting the modernization of the law. In the future, the deep integration of law and technology will become the norm, with the law not only responding to the challenges posed by technology but also proactively guiding the direction of technological development to ensure that technology applications align with principles of social fairness and justice.</p>

            <h2>III. Cross-border Data Flow: From "Single Rules" to "Pluralistic Governance"</h2>
            <h3>1. The Dilemma of the Traditional Single-Rule Model and Challenges in the Global Context</h3>
            <p>In the early stages of cross-border data flow, the "single-rule" model represented by Europe and the United States attempted to simplify compliance processes through unified rules. However, issues such as rule conflicts, enforcement difficulties, and innovation suppression have become increasingly prominent. Differences in legal systems, cultural backgrounds, and social development levels among countries make it difficult for a single rule to reconcile the interests of different nations. Moreover, the tension between the global demand for data flow and national sovereignty has further highlighted the limitations of the single-rule model.</p>
            <h3>2. The Transition from Single-Rule to Pluralistic Governance</h3>
            <p>To construct a "pluralistic governance" system for cross-border data flow, it is necessary to recognize the diversity of national legal systems and encourage countries to formulate appropriate cross-border data flow rules based on their own circumstances. At the same time, government, businesses, industry associations, international organizations, and other stakeholders should participate in governance collectively, building a multi-stakeholder collaborative governance structure. This pluralistic governance model can not only balance the interests of various parties but also provide more flexible and inclusive solutions for global data flow.</p>
            <h3>3. Improvement of Legal Frameworks and Construction of Collaborative Mechanisms</h3>
            <p>Domestic legislation should be improved to clarify the basic principles, rules, and procedures of cross-border data flow. Active participation in the formulation of international rules should be encouraged to promote the establishment of a fair and reasonable international rule system. Cooperation with other countries and regions should be strengthened to explore the establishment of bilateral or multilateral cross-border data flow agreements, building trust mechanisms, information sharing mechanisms, and dispute resolution mechanisms. Additionally, efforts should be made to balance data sovereignty and data sharing, ensuring that cross-border data flow can promote global economic cooperation while safeguarding national security and public interests.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>As big data continues to reshape our world, the need for a robust legal framework that can adapt to these changes becomes increasingly urgent. By shifting focus from ownership to usage rights, ensuring transparency in algorithm processes, and embracing pluralistic governance in cross-border data flow, we can create a legal environment that not only addresses current challenges but also prepares us for the future. In this dynamic landscape, the law must evolve to keep pace with technological advancements, ensuring that the principles of fairness, transparency, and collaboration remain at the forefront. Only through such a framework can we harness the full potential of big data while safeguarding the rights and interests of all stakeholders involved.</p>
