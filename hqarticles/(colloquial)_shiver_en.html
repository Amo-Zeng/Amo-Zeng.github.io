We are translating the phrase "æ•°ç”²" into English. 
 "æ•°ç”²" is a term from the Chinese education system, specifically referring to the highest level of mathematics in the Gaokao (National College Entrance Examination) for science students. 
 In English, it is commonly translated as "Mathematics Level A" or "Advanced Mathematics". 
 However, note that in some contexts, it might be referred to as "Mathematics (Advanced)" or simply "Advanced Math".

 Since the context is the Gaokao, the most precise translation would be "Mathematics Level A" because the Gaokao mathematics exam has two levels: 
   - æ•°ç”² (Mathematics Level A) for science students
   - æ•°ä¹™ (Mathematics Level B) for arts students.

 Therefore, the translation of "æ•°ç”²" is: "Mathematics Level A"

 But note: If the context is not the Gaokao, the term might have a different meaning. However, without additional context, we assume the Gaokao context.

 Final translation: "Mathematics Level A"
</think>
The translation of "æ•°ç”²" into English is **"Mathematics Level A"**.

### Explanation:
- In the context of the Chinese education system (especially the Gaokao), "æ•°ç”²" refers to the **advanced/highest level of mathematics** designed for science/engineering track students. 
- Itâ€™s formally translated as **"Mathematics Level A"** to distinguish it from "æ•°ä¹™" (Mathematics Level B), which is the standard level for humanities/social sciences students.

### Example Usage:
> "He chose to take **Mathematics Level A** in the Gaokao to pursue engineering."  
> (ä»–åœ¨é«˜è€ƒä¸­é€‰æ‹©è€ƒ**æ•°ç”²**ä»¥æ”»è¯»å·¥ç¨‹ä¸“ä¸šã€‚)
