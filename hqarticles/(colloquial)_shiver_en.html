            <h2>Ideological Struggle in the Cultural Sphere</h2>
            <p>In the cultural sphere, the conflict during the Cold War manifested as a profound ideological struggle. Films, music, literature, and art became important mediums for both countries to showcase and propagate their political ideologies and social values. American films like "Gone with the Wind" and "Star Wars" indirectly critiqued the Soviet system by depicting individual heroism and freedom. In contrast, Soviet films like "The Capture of Berlin" and "Young Guard" emphasized collectivism and revolutionary heroism.</p>
            <p>Western pop music, exemplified by bands like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, represented a spirit of freedom and rebellion, resonating with the youth of third world countries. In contrast, Soviet music more often embodied collectivism and revolutionary fervor. In literature and art, Western works such as those by Hemingway and Fitzgerald extolled individual struggle and freedom, while Soviet literature and art often served as tools for political propaganda, such as Mayakovsky's poetry, which strongly expressed socialist ideals.</p>
            <p>These cultural outputs not only strengthened internal identity within their respective blocs but also had profound ideological impacts internationally, shaping the cultural landscapes and value systems of different countries and regions.</p>

            <h2>Technological Rivalry and Its Global Impact</h2>
            <p>The technological rivalry during the Cold War unfolded in fields such as space exploration, computer technology, and nuclear research. The launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union and Yuri Gagarin's space flight shocked the Western world, prompting the United States to accelerate its space exploration efforts. The American Apollo program successfully landed humans on the moon, symbolizing technological and political confidence.</p>
            <p>In computer technology, the development of ENIAC in the United States marked the beginning of the computer era. Rapid advancements in computer technology during the Cold War led to the birth of personal computers. The development of network technology, particularly the Arpanet, eventually evolved into the globally interconnected internet.</p>
            <p>In nuclear research, the United States and the Soviet Union invested heavily in the development of nuclear weapons, driving rapid advancements in nuclear technology. The peaceful application of nuclear energy brought significant technological progress, such as the development of nuclear power generation technology.</p>
            <p>These technological competitions not only changed the technological landscape of the time but also had a profound impact on global technological development in the post-Cold War era. Space exploration continues to drive human understanding of the universe, the development of computer technology has made information technology a significant driver of global economic development, and nuclear technology offers potential solutions to global energy problems.</p>

            <h2>The Establishment and Development of International Law</h2>
            <p>During the Cold War, the international community faced significant challenges in establishing new international laws and rules. The birth of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) provided legal tools to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. The NPT, by establishing the responsibilities of nuclear weapon states and the obligations of non-nuclear weapon states, aims to maintain global nuclear security.</p>
            <p>The United Nations, as a new global governance platform, played a crucial role during the Cold War. The UN provided a forum for discussing and addressing global issues, playing important roles in alleviating regional conflicts, promoting disarmament processes, and ensuring human rights through the Security Council, General Assembly, and various specialized agencies. The UN's peacekeeping operations successfully implemented peace interventions in places like Congo and Cyprus, demonstrating its unique role in conflict resolution.</p>
            <p>After the Cold War, these diplomatic norms, disarmament agreements, and conflict resolution mechanisms formed during the Cold War continued to have a profound impact on the post-Cold War international order. The NPT continues to serve as the core of the global nuclear non-proliferation system, and the UN continues to play a key role in global governance.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Historical Legacy and Future Challenges</h2>
            <p>The multidimensional confrontations during the Cold War, through the establishment of culture, technology, and international law, shaped the international order of the time and had a profound impact on global development in the post-Cold War era. These historical legacies not only provided rules and frameworks for Cold War international relations but also laid the foundation for the post-Cold War international order. However, as the global political and economic landscape continues to evolve, these rules and mechanisms also face new challenges and adjustments. How to adapt these historical legacies to meet the global governance needs of the new era will be an important task for the international community in the future.</p>
