Please provide more context or clarify your question. "数甲" could mean different things depending on the context. For example:

1. If you meant "数学甲组" (Mathematics Group A), it could refer to a math course or competition level.
2. If this is a typo, please let me know the correct term you are referring to.
3. If it's from a specific field or context (such as education, a specific exam, or technical terminology), additional details would help.

Feel free to provide more information so I can assist you better!
