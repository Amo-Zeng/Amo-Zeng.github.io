            <h3>Challenges and Opportunities in Drug Disposal</h3>
            <p>The phenomenon of global drug waste is alarming, with large quantities of expired and unused drugs being discarded haphazardly each year, leading to increasingly severe environmental pollution.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Pollution:</strong> The chemical components in drugs can contaminate soil, water, and air.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Waste:</strong> Drug waste exacerbates the strain on medical resources and increases economic costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Circular Economy:</strong> By establishing a systematic drug disposal supply chain, discarded drugs can be transformed into valuable resources.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Smart Drug Disposal: Technology Empowerment for an Efficient Disposal System</h3>
            <p>The advent of smart drug disposal bins marks the beginning of the intelligent era in drug disposal.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Safety and Intelligence in Tandem:</strong> Smart drug disposal bins feature sealed designs, equipped with temperature and humidity sensors, and ultraviolet sterilization functions.</li>
                <li><strong>Data-Driven Decision Support:</strong> Connected to cloud servers, smart drug disposal bins can upload relevant data about the collected drugs in real time.</li>
                <li><strong>User Engagement and Environmental Incentives:</strong> Smart drug disposal bins interact with users via an APP, providing guidance on drug disposal and eco-points rewards.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Health Education: From Knowledge Dissemination to Behavioral Change</h3>
            <p>Addressing drug disposal issues requires not only focusing on the "stock" but also solving the "flow." Health education becomes an essential complement to drug disposal initiatives.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Integrated Practice: Building a New Community Health Ecology</h3>
            <p>The integration of drug disposal and health education is not just an environmental action but also a practice to enhance community health levels.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Future Outlook: From Communities to Broader Society</h3>
            <p>The combination of smart drug disposal and health education is offering new possibilities for building a sustainable health ecosystem.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The emergence of smart drug disposal technology not only provides an efficient and intelligent solution to the drug disposal problem but also drives the implementation of sustainable development concepts in drug management and community health through deep integration with the circular economy and health education.</p>
