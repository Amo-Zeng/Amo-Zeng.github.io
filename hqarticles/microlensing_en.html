            <h3>Microlensing in Biomedicine</h3>
            <p>Protein molecules on cell membranes are the core executors of life activities, directly influencing cell signaling, material transport, and immune responses. However, due to their small size and rapid movement, traditional microscopy techniques struggle to capture their dynamic changes. Microlensing technology offers a new solution to this problem through its unique optical effects.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Experimental Applications:</strong> Researchers use fluorescently labeled protein molecules, amplifying their movement trajectories through microlensing effects to precisely observe the dynamic behavior of protein molecules.</li>
                <li><strong>Drug Development:</strong> Microlensing technology can be used to screen candidate drugs, assess their binding strength and kinetic properties with target proteins, thereby accelerating the drug development process.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Artificial Intelligence Empowerment: From Data to Insights</h3>
            <p>With the advancement of astronomical observation technology, the data generated by telescopes has increased exponentially. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, especially machine learning and deep learning, provide powerful tools for microlensing data analysis.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Preprocessing and Event Screening:</strong> Machine learning algorithms can quickly and accurately identify microlensing events, significantly improving data processing efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Light Curve Modeling and Prediction:</strong> Deep learning methods can better capture the time dependencies in light curves, predicting the parameters of microlensing events.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Global Observation Network: Collaboration from Earth to Space</h3>
            <p>Currently, several global microlensing observation projects (such as OGLE, MOA, and KMTNet) have achieved significant results in their respective fields. However, due to geographical and equipment limitations, the detection efficiency and data accuracy of individual observatories still face bottlenecks. Building a global microlensing observation network has become key to improving detection rates and data accuracy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ground Observation Network:</strong> Uniting multiple astronomical observatories across different countries and regions to form a network covering various latitudes and longitudes.</li>
                <li><strong>Space Observation Missions:</strong> Launching specialized microlensing observation satellites to overcome atmospheric limitations and obtain clearer, more stable observational data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Microlensing technology, starting from astrophysics, has transcended disciplinary boundaries, demonstrating extensive potential in biomedicine, data analysis, and global observation networks. Through microlensing technology, we not only delve into dark matter and exoplanets in the universe but also reveal the microscopic mechanisms of life activities, providing new insights for drug development. The empowerment of artificial intelligence technology makes microlensing data analysis more efficient and accurate, propelling astronomy into a new era driven by data. The construction of a global observation network provides a solid foundation for unraveling more mysteries of the universe. In the future, with continuous technological advancements and enhanced multidisciplinary collaboration, microlensing technology is expected to achieve more breakthroughs in cosmic exploration and life sciences, expanding the frontiers of human knowledge.</p>
