            <h2>Reconstructing Doctor-Patient Relationships: From Theater Mode to Destiny Community</h2>
            <p>In contemporary medical scenarios, the doctor-patient relationship is often likened to a meticulously scripted drama: doctors as leads, strictly adhering to the "script" of professional authority; patients as supporting characters, passively accepting treatment plans. This "theater mode" ensures medical efficiency but also deepens the tension and estrangement between doctors and patients. With the rapid development of information technology, the digital wave sweeping the globe is profoundly transforming the healthcare industry. However, the existence of the digital divide makes it significantly different for various patient groups to access and utilize digital healthcare resources, further exacerbating doctor-patient conflicts. How to break the predicament of "theater mode," bridge the digital divide, and construct a new model of doctor-patient relationships has become an urgent issue to address.</p>

            <h3>The Dilemma of Doctor-Patient Relationships in Theater Mode</h3>
            <p>The theater theory offers a unique perspective: in medical interactions, both doctors and patients are "actors" participating in a pre-set drama. This pre-setting mainly stems from doctors' professional mindset—the authoritative role formed after specialized training, and patients' compliance expectations towards medical authority. Within this framework, fixed role-playing patterns form: doctors play the role of authority, while patients play the role of followers.</p>
            <p>This role pre-setting brings two significant drawbacks:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mechanization of Doctors' Thinking</strong>: Doctors often simplify complex interpersonal interactions into technical operations, overlooking emotional needs and humanistic care in the medical process.</li>
                <li><strong>Dissolution of Patient Subjectivity</strong>: Patients are forced to fully cede health decision-making authority to doctors, losing active participation in their own health.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These two tendencies not only weaken the essential value of healthcare—healthcare is not just a technical operation but also an organic combination of life care and self-management—but also intensify the estrangement between doctors and patients.</p>

            <h3>The Digital Divide Exacerbates Doctor-Patient Conflicts</h3>
            <p>Under the push of the digital wave, emerging technologies such as telemedicine, electronic medical records, and health management apps bring convenience to both doctors and patients. However, significant differences exist among patient groups of different ages, educational backgrounds, and economic levels in their ability to access and use digital healthcare resources. This "digital divide" further exacerbates doctor-patient conflicts, turning technology into a "barrier" rather than a "bridge."</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Imbalance in Information Access</strong>: Young patients with digital skills can easily access a wealth of healthcare information, while elderly patients may be trapped in "information silos," leading to information asymmetry between doctors and patients. Doctors may feel challenged by "information overload" from patients, while patients may suffer anxiety from excessive information.</li>
                <li><strong>Varied Service Experiences</strong>: Convenient functions such as online booking, electronic payments, and intelligent guidance improve the medical experience for some patients, but those lacking digital skills may face difficulties in booking and long waiting times, further widening the gap in service experiences. Moreover, digital communication methods weaken emotional interactions between doctors and patients, reducing trust.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>From Theater Mode to Destiny Community</h3>
            <p>To break the predicament of "theater mode" and bridge the digital divide, it is essential to reconstruct doctor-patient relationships, transforming them from a closed "actor performance system" to an open "co-creation stage." The core of this reconstruction lies in:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Establishing Equal Dialogue Mechanisms</strong>: Allowing patients to fully express their needs, doctors are no longer unilateral authorities but listeners and collaborators.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultivating Empathy in Doctors</strong>: Helping doctors understand individual differences among patients and respect their emotional needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Building a Participatory Treatment Model</strong>: Integrating patients into the decision-making process of treatment, making them participants in shared decision-making.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In this new doctor-patient relationship model, doctors transition from authoritative "actors" to professional "directors," and patients transform from passive "actors" to active "participants." There are no fixed "scripts," only constantly evolving "plots"; no unilateral "performances," only co-created "art."</p>
            <p><strong>The concept of the "Doctor-Patient Community" offers new perspectives for this reconstruction.</strong> The "Doctor-Patient Community" refers to a new cooperative relationship established between doctors and patients based on shared values, interests, and goals. In this relationship, doctors are no longer lofty authorities, and patients are no longer passive recipients; both are equal partners striving for health maintenance together.</p>
