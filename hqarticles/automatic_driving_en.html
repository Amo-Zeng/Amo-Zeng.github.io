            <h3>From Social Psychology to Building Trust</h3>
            <p>Social psychology plays a critical role in the widespread adoption of autonomous driving technology. Public concerns about the safety of autonomous driving, the fear of new technology, and the anxiety over losing control of driving are common phenomena. To enhance public acceptance, it is necessary to strengthen trust in the safety of the technology.</p>
            <p>Building trust depends not only on the transparency of technical performance but is also deeply influenced by cultural and industry differences. For example, the United States and Japan show significant differences in technology acceptance and social cultural background.</p>

            <h3>Exploring Ethical and Legal Challenges</h3>
            <p>As autonomous vehicles increasingly enter daily life, the ethical and legal challenges they face become more prominent. How machines should make decisions when unavoidable accidents occur has become the focus of ethical discussions.</p>
            <p>On the legal level, autonomous driving technology is redefining the boundaries of accident responsibility attribution. Countries are actively seeking legal solutions. Privacy and data security issues have also emerged.</p>

            <h3>Synergy in Urban Planning</h3>
            <p>The widespread adoption of autonomous driving technology will not only change the form of transportation but will also have a profound impact on urban planning. For example, the extensive use of autonomous vehicles can significantly reduce the need for traditional parking lots.</p>
            <p>By integrating with other smart city technologies, autonomous driving can optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion, thus improving the efficiency of urban transportation systems.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>From psychological acceptance and legal assurance to the coordinated development of urban planning, the widespread adoption of autonomous driving requires the joint efforts of all societal sectors. While advancing transportation convenience and social progress, autonomous driving technology should become a model of harmonious coexistence between humans and technology.</p>
