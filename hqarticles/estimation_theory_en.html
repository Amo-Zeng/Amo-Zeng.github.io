            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the era of rapid development in big data and artificial intelligence technologies, the types and scale of data are growing at an unprecedented rate. Data privacy protection, unstructured data processing, and parameter estimation in dynamic environments have become major challenges faced by both academia and industry. This article will explore how to use deep learning technologies to process unstructured data and perform effective parameter estimation in dynamic environments while protecting data privacy, thereby promoting the healthy development of big data and AI technologies.</p>

            <h3>1. Background and Challenges of Data Privacy Protection</h3>
            <p>Data privacy protection refers to the various technical and management measures taken during the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of data to ensure that personal data is not accessed, used, or disclosed without authorization. In recent years, with the introduction of regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), data privacy protection has become a basic requirement for enterprises and organizations. These regulations not only require transparency in data processing but also mandate effective privacy protection measures in data usage.</p>
            <p>Traditional estimation theory primarily focuses on extracting useful information from data for tasks such as parameter estimation and model training. However, these theories typically assume that data can be directly accessed and used, without considering the need for data privacy protection. In practical applications, data may be restricted by privacy protection laws, and using raw data for estimation can lead to privacy breaches. Therefore, traditional estimation theories are inadequate in the context of data privacy protection.</p>

            <h3>2. Introduction and Application of Differential Privacy</h3>
            <p>Differential Privacy (DP) is a powerful privacy protection technology that aims to ensure that even with extensive background knowledge, an attacker cannot accurately infer any individual's specific information by adding noise to the data or algorithm output. The core idea of differential privacy is that the output distribution of the algorithm should remain almost the same regardless of whether an individual's data is included in the dataset. This technology provides a possibility for effective parameter estimation while protecting data privacy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Parameter Estimation under Differential Privacy:</strong> In the differential privacy framework, the goal of parameter estimation is to estimate model parameters as accurately as possible while protecting data privacy. This typically involves adding noise to the data or model output to meet the requirements of differential privacy. For example, for a linear regression model, noise can be added to the gradients or loss function to achieve parameter estimation under differential privacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Management of Privacy Budget:</strong> An important concept in differential privacy is the privacy budget (Îµ), which determines the extent to which the dataset is protected. In practical applications, it is necessary to allocate the privacy budget reasonably to balance privacy protection and estimation accuracy. For example, a composition mechanism can be used to sum the privacy budgets of multiple queries, ensuring the overall level of privacy protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithm Design and Optimization:</strong> To achieve effective parameter estimation under the differential privacy framework, it is necessary to design and optimize the corresponding algorithms. This includes selecting appropriate noise distributions, determining the scale of noise, and optimizing the computational efficiency of the algorithms. For example, the Laplace mechanism and Gaussian mechanism are two commonly used noise addition methods, each with its own advantages in different application scenarios.</li>
