            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In modern network programming and data processing systems, multiplexing technology is crucial for handling a large number of concurrent connections and high-throughput data streams. `select`, `poll`, and `epoll` are three common I/O multiplexing mechanisms in Linux, each with different design philosophies and implementation methods. This article will delve into the implementation of these mechanisms across different operating systems, their cross-platform compatibility, and performance, and analyze their applications in high concurrency and real-time data stream processing with real-world cases.</p>

            <h2>Core Implementations</h2>
            <p><strong>`select`</strong>, <strong>`poll`</strong>, and <strong>`epoll`</strong> are three common I/O multiplexing mechanisms used to monitor multiple file descriptors (such as network sockets, file descriptors, and pipes), notifying the program when any file descriptor is ready for I/O operations. Here are their basic implementation mechanisms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>`select`</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Implementation Mechanism</strong>: Uses bit masks to represent sets of file descriptors, with each file descriptor mapped to a bit. When an I/O event occurs, the corresponding bit is set to 1.</li>
                        <li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Widely supported, simple to use.</li>
                        <li><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Limited number of file descriptors (typically 1024), the entire set of file descriptors needs to be passed between user space and kernel space on each call.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>`poll`</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Implementation Mechanism</strong>: Uses an array of `pollfd` structures to represent file descriptor sets, avoiding the limitations of bit masks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Advantages</strong>: No hard limit on the number of file descriptors, slightly more efficient than `select`.</li>
                        <li><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Still requires passing the entire file descriptor set, performs poorly under high concurrency scenarios.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>`epoll`</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Implementation Mechanism</strong>: A Linux-specific I/O event notification mechanism that uses an event table to track interested file descriptors, managed through `epoll_create`, `epoll_ctl`, and `epoll_wait` operations on the event table.</li>
                        <li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Only active file descriptors are passed, extremely efficient, supports both level-triggered (LT) and edge-triggered (ET) modes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Limited to Linux, not cross-platform.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
