            <h2>Health Equity in the Digital Age: From the Digital Divide to the Reconstruction of the Health Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of digital technology, the healthcare sector is undergoing a profound revolution. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things are redefining disease diagnosis, health management, and disease prediction models. However, despite the unprecedented opportunities brought by technological advancements, they have not led to universal health equity; instead, they have deepened the "health divide." This gap is not only evident in access to healthcare resources but also in disparities in health outcomes. The root cause of this inequality is not merely the traditional issue of uneven distribution of healthcare resources but is also a complex interplay of factors including the digital divide, socio-economic differences, and environmental influences. Therefore, we need to address the "digital divide" to reconstruct the health ecosystem and explore a new paradigm of health equity based on the concept of "active health."</p>

            <h3>I. The Digital Divide and Health Divide: Hidden Inequalities Behind Technological Progress</h3>
            <p>The widespread adoption of digital technology has brought revolutionary changes to the healthcare sector, yet these changes hide profound social inequalities. In economically developed areas, residents can easily access advanced technologies such as online health consultations, telemedicine, and smart wearable devices, benefiting from the convenience brought by technological progress. In contrast, residents in remote areas, where internet infrastructure is lacking and healthcare resources are scarce, are excluded from the benefits of digital healthcare. This imbalance in technology access not only exacerbates the uneven distribution of healthcare resources but also creates a vicious cycle: those who gain early access to digital healthcare have better health outcomes, while those who are远离数字化 have continuously deteriorating health.</p>
            <p>More seriously, the adoption of digital healthcare has led to an increasing reliance on data analysis and artificial intelligence for medical decisions. However, these decisions are based on the accumulation of large amounts of data. Vulnerable groups, due to a lack of technical devices and digital literacy, struggle to generate sufficient data for system analysis, putting them at a disadvantage in medical decision-making. This inequality in data access is particularly prominent in chronic disease management, disease screening, and health interventions. For example, elderly populations, due to technical barriers, are often excluded from the digital healthcare system, making their health conditions even more precarious.</p>

            <h3>II. From Disease Treatment to Health Ecosystem: Beyond a Single-Dimensional Concept of Health Equity</h3>
            <p>The traditional concept of health equity primarily focuses on the equal distribution of healthcare resources, but this does not address the root causes of health disparities. Health is not merely a simple sum of medical services but is profoundly influenced by multiple socio-economic factors such as income gaps, education levels, living environments, and employment conditions. For instance, the health gap between urban and rural areas is not only reflected in the distribution of healthcare resources but also in the coverage of public health services, health education levels, and environmental quality. Meanwhile, environmental factors such as air pollution, water pollution, and food safety pose threats to health that are often regional and group-specific. The complexity and breadth of these issues far exceed the capacity of the healthcare system alone.</p>
            <p>Therefore, we need to recognize that health equity is not just about equal access to medical services but is a comprehensive issue involving environmental, social, and economic dimensions. Building a health ecosystem means we must view health as a concept closely related to socio-economic development, environmental quality, and public welfare. In this system, environmental elements such as air quality, water safety, and soil health directly affect the health levels of populations; while socio-economic factors such as income levels, educational opportunities, and employment security determine individuals' ability to invest in health resources and their awareness of disease prevention.</p>

            <h3>III. From Reactive Medicine to Active Health: Reconstructing a New Paradigm of Health Equity</h3>
            <p>With the rise of the "active health" concept, we need to re-examine the内涵 and implementation pathways of health equity. The traditional medical model overemphasizes "disease treatment" while neglecting the active maintenance of health. The "active health" concept, however, emphasizes that health is the dynamic interaction result of individuals, society, and the environment, rather than a process of merely treating diseases. It views health as a "state of capability" rather than a "state of deficiency." Under this framework, health equity not only means equal access to medical services but also includes unimpeded access to health-related knowledge, resources, and environments. For example, in areas with severe air pollution, even with ample medical services, residents' health levels may still be lower than those in cleaner environments. This underscores the importance of environmental factors in health equity.</p>
            <p>Based on the "active health" concept, the pathway to achieving health equity needs to go beyond traditional medical service distribution and move toward broader social system adjustments. First, policy-making should shift from "treating existing diseases" to "preventing future diseases." The importance of preventive medicine is increasingly emphasized, and health equity strategies should focus more on health promotion, disease prevention, and early intervention. Second, achieving health equity requires a systems approach. Health is closely related to education, housing, employment, and environment, making cross-sectoral policy integration a necessary means. For example, malnourished children, due to lack of food resources, may face both health and education issues. This cross-sectoral impact on health requires comprehensive policy solutions.</p>

            <h3>IV. Building a Comprehensive Pathway for Health Equity: Synergy of Policy, Technology, and Society</h3>
            <p>To bridge the health divide, a systematic design is needed from multiple dimensions including policy, technology, and education. At the policy level, the government should formulate targeted policies to promote the accessibility and affordability of digital healthcare services, particularly by prioritizing the deployment of basic network infrastructure and promoting health information services in remote areas. Technological innovation needs to consider inclusiveness, developing user-friendly digital healthcare products for the elderly and exploring technologies such as voice recognition and AI-assisted tools to lower the barrier to using digital healthcare.</p>
            <p>Building a health ecosystem requires a shift from "treating diseases" to "preventing diseases." This necessitates strengthening the public health service system, improving the disease prevention and control network, and enhancing overall health literacy. By strengthening health management for high-risk groups, the occurrence of major diseases can be effectively prevented and controlled.</p>
            <p>Achieving health equity also requires creating a health-promoting social environment and empowering individuals to manage their own health. This will not only improve overall health levels but also promote social justice, creating a fairer and healthier future.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In the context of globalization and digitalization, the issue of health equity has become increasingly complex. Digital technology was meant to be a tool for promoting health equity, but its misuse may instead exacerbate health inequalities. We must urgently recognize the seriousness of this problem and, through systemic reform and innovation, build a truly inclusive and equitable digital health system. Only in this way can we ensure that everyone, regardless of their economic status, location, age, or education level, can equally enjoy the health benefits brought by technological progress. This is an inevitable requirement for building a community with a shared future for mankind and an important aspect of achieving social equity and justice.</p>
