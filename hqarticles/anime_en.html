            <h3>Animation as a Bridge for Cultural Exchange</h3>
            <p>Animation uniquely transcends language, geography, and cultural boundaries, deeply conveying cultural values, social issues, and historical contexts.</p>

                <li><strong>Disney Animation from the USA:</strong> Disney's works such as "The Lion King" and "Frozen" not only showcase the American dream and spirit of perseverance but also begin to address gender equality and racial integration.</li>
                <li><strong>Animated Films from Europe:</strong> For example, "The Little Prince" and "Outside the Wall" explore the meaning of life and social issues through their unique artistic styles and profound humanistic care.</li>

            <h3>The Fusion of Animation and Technological Innovation</h3>
            <p>The development of animation is closely related to technological innovation. From hand-drawn animation to computer-generated imagery (CGI), virtual reality (VR), and artificial intelligence (AI) applications, advancements in animation technology have not only changed the visual presentation of films but also revolutionized narrative methods and audience experiences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Golden Age of Hand-Drawn Animation:</strong> Represented by Disney's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," marking the maturity of animation as an art form.</li>
                <li><strong>3D Animation and "Toy Story":</strong> Pixar's works ushered in a new era of 3D animation.</li>
                <li><strong>Motion Capture and Live-Action Animation:</strong> Such as "Avatar," which enhances the realism and complexity of animation through technology that captures real movements.</li>
                <li><strong>Innovation in CGI and Visual Effects:</strong> From "The Lord of the Rings" to "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," CGI technology enables animation to create more expansive and deep visual worlds.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Rendering and VR:</strong> Providing a more interactive and immersive experience.</li>
                <li><strong>The Application of AI in Animation:</strong> The introduction of AI not only improves production efficiency but also offers new creative possibilities for animation creation.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Psychotherapy:</strong> Animation can assist individuals in processing complex emotions and traumas. For instance, Pixar shorts like "Sandy" and "Inside Out" help viewers understand and cope with personal emotional issues through characters and narratives.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Comprehensive Conclusion</h3>
            <p>As a form of visual art, animation is not only a medium of entertainment but also an effective tool for cross-cultural communication, technological innovation, and education and psychotherapy.
