            <h2>The Galois Group in Music Theory: Symmetry and Auditory Experience</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The Galois group was initially introduced by the French mathematician Évariste Galois to solve the structure of roots of algebraic equations. However, the symmetry of the Galois group extends beyond pure mathematics, showing profound application value in music theory. This article will explore how the Galois group influences tonality, melody, and auditory experience through its symmetric transformations.</p>

            <h3>Symmetry and Musical Structure</h3>
            <p>In music theory, symmetry is a key concept. Through symmetric transformations like reflection, rotation, and translation, composers can construct complex melodies and chord structures. These transformations are not merely mathematical operations; they directly affect the expressiveness of music.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> In music, the fundamental note and its reflected form can create a strong contrast, enhancing the drama of the music. For example, C major and its reflected A minor have starkly different emotional expressions.</li>
                <li><strong>Rotation:</strong> Rotational symmetry can be used to build harmonious chord sequences. By rotating chords around the circle of fifths, pleasing harmonic effects can be produced, commonly seen in Bach's fugues.</li>
                <li><strong>Translation:</strong> Translational symmetry is often used in repetitive structures like rondos. This repetition makes it easier for listeners to follow the rhythm, creating a sense of familiarity and stability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tonality and Group Theory</h3>
            <p>Tonality is one of the fundamental structures in music. Through the Galois group, we can map different notes and chords onto group elements, thereby analyzing the symmetry of tonality. This mapping not only reveals the internal structure of music but also provides new tools for composition.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Polytonal Music:</strong> In polytonal music, composers can blend different tonal systems through group theory. For instance, Schönberg's twelve-tone technique is an extreme application of polytonality, which can be better understood through Galois group analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Tonal Modulation:</strong> The Galois group can help analyze relationships between tonal modulations, predict chord progressions, and make music sound more coherent and logical to the listener.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mathematical Model of Auditory Experience</h3>
            <p>The application of the Galois group is not limited to structural analysis of music but can also be used to build mathematical models of auditory experience. By transforming different auditory stimuli on the group, one can predict the reactions and emotional experiences of the audience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Perception Patterns:</strong> For example, through symmetric analysis of Bach's fugues, one can predict the perception patterns of its audience. Such predictions are not only valuable for music creators but also for psychologists studying how music influences human emotion and cognition.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Guidance:</strong> Through symmetric transformations, composers can guide the emotional journey of the listener, using symmetry to create different emotional layers and contrasts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The application of the Galois group in music theory demonstrates the close connection between mathematics and art. By cleverly using the symmetry of group theory, composers not only deepen their understanding of musical structure but can also create richer and more complex musical works. Additionally, this interdisciplinary research opens new research avenues in music psychology and cognitive science. The multifaceted nature of the Galois group not only expands the applicability of its theory but also provides infinite potential for future music composition and research.</p>
            <p>The introduction of the Galois group makes music theory not just an expression of art but also a precise science. Through the exploration of symmetry, music becomes not only an auditory art but also an embodiment of mathematical aesthetics. In the future, with further research and practice, this fusion of theory and art will deepen, bringing more innovative possibilities to music creation.</p>
