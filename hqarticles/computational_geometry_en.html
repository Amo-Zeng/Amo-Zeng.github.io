            <h3>The Collision of Computational Geometry and Quantum Computing: Surpassing the Limits of Classical Computation</h3>
            <h4>Bottlenecks of Classical Computation</h4>
            <p>With the explosive growth of data scale, many classic computational geometry problems exhibit significant computational bottlenecks on classical computers. For example, problems like convex hull calculation and shortest path finding show inadequate time complexity in large-scale data processing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Convex Hull Calculation:</strong> Calculating the convex hull of a set of points is a fundamental problem in computational geometry. Classic algorithms like Graham's scan and Jarvis's march have time complexities of O(n log n) and O(nh), respectively, where n is the number of points and h is the number of points on the convex hull. When n is very large, the computational efficiency of these algorithms significantly decreases.</li>
                <li><strong>Shortest Path Problem:</strong> In computer graphics and network analysis, the shortest path problem is a core issue. The time complexities of classic algorithms like Dijkstra's and A* are O((n + m) log n) and O(b^d), respectively, where n is the number of nodes, m is the number of edges, b is the branching factor, and d is the path length. For large-scale networks, the computation time of these algorithms rapidly increases.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Advantages of Quantum Computing</h4>
            <p>The emergence of quantum computers provides new solutions to these classic computational geometry problems. Quantum computers utilize the properties of quantum superposition and entanglement to achieve exponential speedup in certain specific problems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quantum Superposition:</strong> While classical computers can only process one state at a time, quantum computers can process multiple states simultaneously, as quantum bits (qubits) can exist in superposition states. This parallelism allows quantum computers to process large amounts of data in a single operation.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantum Entanglement:</strong> Quantum entanglement refers to the correlation between multiple qubits, where even if they are distant from each other, their states can instantaneously affect each other. This property allows quantum computers to process information in a non-classical way, thereby accelerating certain computational problems.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Frontier Exploration Directions</h4>
            <h5>Quantum Algorithm Design</h5>
            <p>Researchers are designing efficient quantum algorithms for classic computational geometry problems. These algorithms aim to surpass the complexity of classical algorithms by leveraging the parallelism and entanglement characteristics of quantum computers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quantum Convex Hull Algorithm:</strong> Researchers are exploring how to use quantum superposition and entanglement to accelerate convex hull calculations. Preliminary studies suggest that quantum algorithms may achieve time complexity of O(n^(1/2)), far lower than the O(n log n) of classical algorithms.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantum Shortest Path Algorithm:</strong> Quantum shortest path algorithms like QSP (Quantum Shortest Path) utilize quantum parallelism and superposition of quantum states, potentially achieving time complexity of O(n^(1/2)), far lower than the O((n + m) log n) of classical algorithms.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Development of Quantum Computational Geometry Libraries</h5>
            <p>To promote the application of quantum computational geometry, researchers are developing computational geometry libraries based on quantum computers. These libraries will provide convenience for researchers and developers in related fields, enabling them to more easily leverage the advantages of quantum computing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>QGeoLib:</strong> This is a computational geometry library based on quantum computers, providing functions such as quantum convex hull calculation and quantum point location. The library's design goal is to maximally utilize the parallelism and entanglement characteristics of quantum computers, enabling efficient solutions to computational geometry problems on quantum computers.</li>
                <li><strong>QPathFinder:</strong> This library focuses on quantum shortest path problems, providing multiple quantum shortest path algorithms and supporting shortest path calculations for large-scale networks. The library's design goal is to enable efficient large-scale network analysis on quantum computers.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Quantum-Classical Hybrid Algorithms</h5>
            <p>Since current quantum computers are still under development, fully relying on quantum computing may not be practical. Therefore, researchers are exploring quantum-classical hybrid algorithms, combining the strengths of quantum and classical computing to gradually solve practical problems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hybrid Convex Hull Algorithm:</strong> This algorithm combines the strengths of classical and quantum computing. It first uses classical algorithms for data preprocessing and then uses quantum algorithms for efficient calculation. This method can achieve efficient convex hull calculations on existing quantum computer architectures.</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid Shortest Path Algorithm:</strong> This algorithm uses classical algorithms for network preprocessing and then uses quantum algorithms for efficient shortest path calculation. This method can achieve efficient large-scale network analysis on existing quantum computer architectures.</li>
