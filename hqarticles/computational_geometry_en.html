            <h3>1. Robot Navigation</h3>
            <p>Robot navigation is a critical application area of computational geometry. Robots need to autonomously move in complex environments, avoiding obstacles and finding optimal paths. The <strong>convex hull algorithm</strong> and <strong>Voronoi diagrams</strong> play key roles here.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Convex Hull Algorithm</strong>: Used to identify the smallest enclosing convex polygon around the robot, simplifying obstacle representation and helping the robot quickly determine whether it can pass safely.</li>
                <li><strong>Voronoi Diagrams</strong>: Used to generate safe distance maps between the robot and obstacles, ensuring the robot maintains a safe distance from obstacles during movement.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Computer Vision</h3>
            <p>Many problems in computer vision, such as image segmentation, object detection, and 3D reconstruction, rely on the theories and algorithms of computational geometry.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Delaunay Triangulation</strong>: In 3D reconstruction, Delaunay triangulation is used to generate surface meshes of objects, ensuring uniformity and stability of the mesh.</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>3. Geographic Information Systems (GIS)</h3>
            <p>Spatial data analysis and processing in geographic information systems also rely heavily on computational geometry.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spatial Indexing</strong>: Such as R-trees and quadtrees, used for efficient storage and retrieval of geospatial data.</li>

            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Case Study: Logistics Path Optimization</h2>
            <p>Logistics path optimization is a typical real-world problem involving finding the shortest or optimal transportation path given start and end points. The <strong>convex hull algorithm</strong> and <strong>dynamic programming</strong> play crucial roles here.</p>
            <h3>Algorithm Principles</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Convex Hull Algorithm</strong>: First, use the convex hull algorithm to generate the convex hull of all logistics nodes. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon containing all nodes, simplifying the path planning problem and reducing computational complexity.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Programming</strong>: Based on the convex hull, use dynamic programming to calculate the shortest path. Dynamic programming decomposes the problem into subproblems and uses the optimal solutions of these subproblems to construct the global optimal solution.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Implementation Details</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong>: First, collect the coordinate data of all logistics nodes and preprocess it, such as removing redundant nodes and outliers.</li>
                <li><strong>Convex Hull Generation</strong>: Use algorithms like Graham scan or Jarvis march to generate the convex hull. These algorithms have a time complexity of O(n log n) and are suitable for large datasets.</li>
                <li><strong>Path Planning</strong>: Based on the convex hull, use dynamic programming to calculate the shortest path. Although dynamic programming has a time complexity of O(n^2), the actual computational effort is significantly reduced under the constraints of the convex hull.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Optimization Effects</h3>
            <p>Optimizing logistics paths with computational geometry algorithms can significantly reduce transportation costs and time. For example, in a real-world application by a logistics company, using the convex hull algorithm and dynamic programming to optimize paths resulted in a 15% reduction in average transportation time and a 10% reduction in transportation costs.</p>
