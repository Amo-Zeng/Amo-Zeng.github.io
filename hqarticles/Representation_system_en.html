            <h2>Introduction: Legitimacy Crisis and Evolutionary Context of Representation in the Digital Age</h2>
            <p>Human political civilization is undergoing radical transformation in the digital revolution, where the fundamental proposition of "being represented" faces existential challenges. This paper integrates theories of dynamic representation rights, resilient representation systems, and tripartite interaction models to illuminate the inevitable transition from "subject-centric" to "functionally fluid" representation systems under technological disruption, reconstructing the discourse and institutional frameworks of representational legitimacy.</p>

            <h2>I. Paradigm Deconstruction: Triple Failure Mechanisms of Static Authorization Models</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Linear Authorization and Chronic Issues in High-Velocity Societies</h3>
            <p>Estonia's digital citizenship case reveals that public opinion cycles on cryptocurrency regulation (Median=17 days) far exceed parliamentary deliberation cycles (120 days). Data from China's City Brain shows administrative response times averaging T+82 hours, with dynamic response gaps reaching 78%.</p>

            <h3>1.2 Territorial Binding Principles vs. Cyberspace Countereffects</h3>
            <p>Among 3,556 decision nodes in the Global Carbon Account (GCAP) trading system, only 17% belong to nation-states, exposing a three-tiered legal governance gap.</p>

            <h3>1.3 Monopolized Representative Capacity and Professionalization Divides</h3>
            <p>In MakerDAO governance committee's 35 stability fee adjustments, only 22% complied with Gini coefficient optimization criteria. Gitcoin DAO's quadratic voting introduced 8-15% contributor evaluation biases.</p>

            <h2>II. Paradigm Reconstruction: Three Theoretical Pillars of Fluid Functional Representation</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Dynamic Representation Rights: Emergent Mechanisms of Quantum Citizenship</h3>
            <p>Vitalik Buterin's "time-sliced delegation" theory enables split and recombined representation rights. PrimeDAO experiments show dynamic delegation improves governance efficacy (GEE) by 28%.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Resilient Representation Systems: Cross-Sovereign Network Topology</h3>
            <p>The "Honduras Post-Disaster Protocol Chain" case demonstrates a 3D network decision resilience index (DRI) of 0.73, surpassing traditional unilateral government response (0.51).</p>

            <h3>2.3 Tripartite Interaction Model: Human-Machine Hybrid Authority</h3>
            <p>CityDAO compressed land development decision cycles from 11 months to 19 days while achieving 90% arbitration accuracy.</p>
