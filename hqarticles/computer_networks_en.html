**Summary:**  
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) enhances efficiency but also raises critical data privacy concerns. AI systems rely on vast datasets for training, increasing risks of excessive data collection, misuse, and de-anonymization. To address these challenges, technical solutions like **differential privacy** (adding noise to data) and **federated learning** (decentralized training) mitigate privacy risks. Regulations such as the **GDPR** enforce user consent and data minimization principles. Balancing innovation with privacy requires collaboration: enterprises must adopt transparent governance, developers should refine privacy-preserving algorithms, and governments need robust compliance frameworks. Only through multi-stakeholder cooperation can a secure and ethical AI ecosystem thrive.

**Notes on Localization:**  
1. **Technical Terms:** Retained exact translations (e.g., 差分隐私 → "differential privacy") for global recognition.  
2. **Conciseness:** Adjusted sentence structures (e.g., "唯有多方协作" → "Only through multi-stakeholder cooperation") to align with English brevity norms.  
3. **Active Voice:** Replaced implicit Chinese constructs (e.g., "需技术、法规与公众意识协同") with active phrasing ("requires collaboration").  
4. **SEO Keywords:** Grouped for readability while maintaining density.  

**Keyphrase Integration Example:**  
- Original: "AI系统依赖海量数据训练" → "AI systems rely on vast datasets for training" (naturally embeds "artificial intelligence" and "data").  
- Challenge: Translating "去匿名化" as "de-anonymization" preserves technical accuracy despite being less common in general discourse.
