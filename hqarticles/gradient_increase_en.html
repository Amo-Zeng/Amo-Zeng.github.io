            <h2>The Brilliance and Limitations of Gradient Boosting</h2>
            <p>Gradient boosting, as an ensemble learning algorithm, excels in handling regression and classification tasks. Its core strengths lie in powerful predictive capabilities and efficient training efficiency. However, gradient boosting algorithms also have significant limitations, such as the "black box effect," over-reliance on data, and lack of common sense reasoning.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Expanding Gradient Boosting's Application in Unstructured Data</h2>
            <p>With unstructured data accounting for over 80% of the total data, gradient boosting algorithms have expanded their application boundaries in unstructured data through integration with deep learning technologies. By combining feature extraction with gradient boosting, model integration, and end-to-end joint training, gradient boosting algorithms have demonstrated enormous potential in medical imaging analysis, social media sentiment analysis, voice assistants, and other fields.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>"Knowledge Boosting": From Gradient Boosting to AI's Value Reconstruction</h2>
            <p>The "Knowledge Boosting" concept drives AI's transition from "data-driven" to "knowledge-guided" by introducing domain knowledge and common sense reasoning. Through the introduction of domain knowledge, the construction of knowledge graphs, and the enhancement of common sense reasoning, AI systems can build more transparent, reliable, and interpretable AI systems.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Fairness Challenges and Future Directions of Gradient Boosting</h2>
            <p>The "black box" nature of gradient boosting algorithms and their over-reliance on data raise concerns about fairness. Through the development of Explainable AI (XAI) and the establishment of fairness assessment frameworks, we can enhance model transparency and fairness, ensuring their impartiality in high-risk applications.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Looking Ahead: A New AI Paradigm from "Data-Driven" to "Knowledge-Guided"</h2>
            <p>From gradient boosting to "knowledge boosting," the development of AI not only requires technological leaps but also deep integration of technical and social values. In the future, we need to strengthen research in knowledge engineering, develop hybrid intelligent systems, and promote human-machine collaborative innovation to build a smarter, fairer, and more inclusive digital future.</p>
