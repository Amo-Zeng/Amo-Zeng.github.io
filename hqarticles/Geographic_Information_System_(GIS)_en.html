            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the context of rapid urbanization worldwide, the concept of smart cities has emerged, aiming to enhance urban management efficiency and quality through advanced information technologies. As one of the core technologies of smart cities, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have gradually become the "brain" of urban management, leveraging their powerful spatial data processing and multi-source data integration capabilities. However, with the advent of the big data era, GIS is undergoing a transformation from a single tool to cross-disciplinary integration, with its role in smart city construction becoming increasingly prominent. This article will explore how GIS empowers data-driven decision-making through data integration, analysis, and visualization, driving the intelligent development of future smart cities.</p>

            <h2>1. Cross-Disciplinary Integration of GIS and Spatio-Temporal Big Data: Building the Data Foundation of Smart Cities</h2>
            <p>The development of GIS has transcended the traditional realm of geographic data management, evolving into a comprehensive platform integrating spatial data acquisition, storage, management, analysis, and visualization. In the era of big data, the deep integration of GIS with remote sensing imagery, IoT sensor data, social media data, and other domains has constructed a more comprehensive, dynamic, and intelligent spatio-temporal big data platform. This cross-disciplinary integration provides rich data resources for the construction of smart cities and offers urban managers more scientific decision-support.</p>
            <h3>1.1 The Data Foundation of Smart Cities: GIS + Spatio-Temporal Big Data</h3>
            <p>Spatio-temporal big data refers to massive, diverse, high-speed data sets with temporal and spatial attributes, encompassing geographic spatial data, remote sensing data, sensor data, social media data, and more. GIS integrates these data to provide a comprehensive data foundation for smart cities.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Integration of GIS with IoT and AI</h3>
            <p>With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, GIS is deeply integrating with these emerging technologies, offering more intelligent and refined solutions for smart city management.</p>
