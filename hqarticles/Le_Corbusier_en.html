            <h2>Technology, Environment, and Social Justice: A Multidimensional Exploration of Le Corbusier's Architectural Design</h2>
            <p>Le Corbusier, as a pioneer in modern architecture and urban planning, not only pushed the boundaries of architectural technology but also deeply influenced 20th-century urban life and social structures. This article will comprehensively analyze Corbusier's architectural practices from the perspectives of technological innovation, environmental psychology, and social justice, revealing how his designs interact across these different fields to form a powerful force changing both architectural and societal landscapes.</p>

            <h3>Interaction Between Technology and Architecture</h3>
            <p><strong>Reinforced Concrete and Modular Design:</strong> Le Corbusier's innovative use of reinforced concrete ushered in a new era of architectural design. The application of this material not only offered structural freedom but also promoted the modularization and standardization of buildings. Through his "Modulor" system, building components could be prefabricated and assembled, enhancing construction efficiency and reducing costs. This approach was particularly evident in the Unit√© d'Habitation in Marseille, where prefabricated components made the building both unique and practical, showcasing Corbusier's perfect blend of technology and practicality. Notably, this design method not only improved the durability and safety of buildings but also provided new design ideas and methods for future architects.</p>
            <p><strong>Technological Considerations in Urban Planning:</strong> In urban planning, Le Corbusier's "Radiant City" concept addressed traffic congestion through the design of elevated roads and highways, while also anticipating the arrival of the information age, emphasizing the need for urban design to consider future communication technologies. This was not just a keen insight into contemporary technology but also foresaw the deep integration of architecture with technology. Moreover, his planning considered residents' convenience and sustainability, like the use of solar energy and natural ventilation systems.</p>

            <h3>Environmental Psychology and Living Spaces</h3>
            <p><strong>Spatial Layout and Psychological Effects:</strong> Le Corbusier's open design aimed to promote community interaction and enhance a sense of belonging among residents. However, from an environmental psychology perspective, this open design might enhance social interaction at the expense of privacy, impacting residents' mental health. Additionally, his multifunctional space design, while increasing space efficiency, might also increase cognitive load on residents. Designers must balance openness with privacy to ensure residents can enjoy community interaction while having personal space.</p>
            <p><strong>Use of Light and Color:</strong> Le Corbusier's emphasis on natural light and color is vividly reflected in his designs. He incorporated natural light through numerous windows and balconies, uplifting residents' mood and quality of life. However, excessive or improper use of light and color can also cause discomfort, like visual fatigue or mood dips. Therefore, precise calculations are needed in design to ensure the positive psychological impact of light and color.</p>
            <p><strong>Incorporation of Green Spaces:</strong> The rooftop garden in the "Marseille Unit" was an innovative attempt to provide a nature-close space for residents. However, its practical use was limited by maintenance and resident participation, reflecting the gap between design ideals and real-world application. To achieve this ideal, designers must consider maintenance and usage needs to ensure the sustainability and functionality of green spaces.</p>

            <h3>Social Justice and Architectural Practice</h3>
            <p><strong>Equal Living Conditions and Poverty Issues:</strong> Corbusier's "machines for living" philosophy aimed to provide standardized housing solutions to offer equal living conditions to different social strata. In practice, however, these designs catered more to middle-class needs, while adaptability and sustainability for the impoverished remained a challenge. Future designs should focus more on respecting the needs and cultural backgrounds of different social groups to achieve true social justice.</p>
            <p><strong>Urban Planning and Social Integration:</strong> His urban planning concepts, while addressing urban issues, might lead to social isolation and a lack of community feeling. High-rise designs might not align with all residents' cultural backgrounds and lifestyles, showing limitations in promoting social justice. Urban planning needs to be more humanistic and diverse to ensure interaction and integration among different communities.</p>

            <h3>Comprehensive Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Le Corbusier's architectural designs have had profound effects on technological innovation, environmental psychology, and social justice. He redefined the possibilities of architecture through new technologies, advancing architectural technology; through careful design of light, space, and color, he sought to enhance human living experiences; and his design philosophy attempted to address social justice through standardization and modularization.</p>
            <p>However, his designs also showed clear limitations. Technological progress does not always align perfectly with environmental psychology and social justice; open spaces might sacrifice privacy, standardized designs might not suit all cultural contexts, and the grand ideals of urban planning face numerous challenges in practice. These issues indicate that architectural design needs to find a balance among technology, environment, and social justice to ensure designs are not just about aesthetics and functionality but also about promoting social harmony.</p>
            <p>Corbusier's legacy is not only the buildings he left behind but also his profound reflections on the interaction between architecture and society, providing valuable experience and inspiration for future architectural design and urban planning. Future architects and urban planners should, inspired by Corbusier, continue to explore how architectural design can harmoniously develop technology, environment, and social justice.</p>
