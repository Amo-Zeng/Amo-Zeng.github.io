            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As a core tool in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, cardiac stents have saved countless lives worldwide. However, while traditional metal stents restore blood flow in the short term, they may lead to long-term vascular wall inflammation and restenosis risks. With the rapid advancements in biotechnology and material science, cardiac stents are evolving from simple physical support tools into personalized, intelligent vascular reconstruction systems. This article explores the future directions of cardiac stents from three perspectives: personalized data acquisition, novel materials and technology applications, and intelligent interaction and real-time monitoring, revealing the revolutionary transition from "stent implantation" to "stent reconstruction."</p>

            <h3>Personalized Data-Driven Design</h3>
            <p>The core of personalized stents lies in customizing them based on the patient's genes, vascular size, and disease progression. To achieve this, personalized data from the patient must first be acquired. Genomic sequencing technology can quickly and accurately analyze the patient's genetic information, identifying gene mutations and polymorphisms related to cardiovascular disease. High-resolution vascular imaging techniques (such as CTA and MRI) can precisely measure the size and morphology of the blood vessels, providing detailed geometric parameters for stent design. By integrating this data, doctors and engineers can collaboratively design the most suitable personalized stents for the patient. For example, patients with specific gene mutations may require stents with stronger anti-inflammatory properties, while those with abnormal vascular morphology may need more complex stent structures to ensure proper fit.</p>

            <h3>Innovation Driven by New Materials and Technologies</h3>
            <p>The fabrication of personalized stents relies on the support of new materials and technologies. While traditional metal stents offer good mechanical properties, their biocompatibility and regenerative promotion capabilities are limited. In the future, stents made from biodegradable materials will become the mainstream. These materials gradually degrade in the body, releasing regenerative factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Through 3D printing technology, stents with complex structures can be precisely manufactured based on the patient's vascular data, ensuring perfect fit with the vessel wall. Furthermore, the development of nanotechnology also opens up new possibilities for personalized stents. Nanocoatings can be used to regulate the biological activity of stents, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and endothelial regeneration properties. By precisely controlling these functions, personalized stents can better adapt to the patient's physiological environment, reducing the risk of rejection and restenosis.</p>

            <h3>Intelligent Interaction and Real-Time Monitoring</h3>
            <p>Another key element of "stent reconstruction" is the intelligent design of stents. In the future, stents will not only be physical support structures but also integrate sensors and microelectronics to enable real-time monitoring of physiological parameters within the vessel, such as blood flow velocity, pressure, and inflammatory markers. This data can be transmitted wirelessly to doctors in real time, allowing for dynamic evaluation and adjustment of the treatment effect. For example, when inflammation is effectively controlled, the stent can automatically adjust the release of biological active factors to further promote vascular regeneration. This intelligent stent not only enhances the precision of treatment but also provides patients with safer and more personalized treatment options.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the application of artificial intelligence technology will further enhance the intelligence level of stents. Through big data analysis and machine learning algorithms, stents can predict potential complications based on the patient's medical history and real-time monitoring data, and take preventive measures in advance. For instance, the stent can automatically adjust its degradation time based on the patient's vascular remodeling progress, ensuring complete repair before dissolution and avoiding premature degradation leading to insufficient support or delayed degradation causing inflammation.</p>

            <h3>The Revolution from "Stent Implantation" to "Stent Reconstruction"</h3>
            <p>Traditional cardiac stent implantation surgery primarily focuses on restoring blood flow, while future personalized stents will elevate the treatment objective to preventing and delaying disease progression. By combining the patient's genetic and disease data, personalized stents can be designed with specific biological activities, such as targeted release of anti-inflammatory drugs or endothelial cell regeneration factors. These functions not only reduce complications after stent implantation but also fundamentally improve the patient's vascular health.</p>
            <p>This transformation will not only optimize the allocation of medical resources but also shift the medical model from "one-size-fits-all" to "precision medicine." Doctors will be able to develop more effective treatment plans based on individual patient differences, significantly improving treatment outcomes and quality of life. Furthermore, the success of "stent reconstruction" will stimulate more interdisciplinary collaboration, such as the close cooperation between biologists, material scientists, engineers, and clinicians, jointly driving innovation in cardiovascular disease treatment.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The future of cardiac stents is full of limitless possibilities. Through personalized data-driven design, the application of new materials and technologies, and intelligent real-time monitoring and interaction, future stents will no longer be simple support structures but will actively participate in vascular repair and regeneration as biomedical systems. This revolutionary transformation will significantly enhance patient treatment outcomes and quality of life, driving fundamental changes in the cardiovascular medical model and bringing new hope to millions of cardiovascular disease patients worldwide. With continuous progress in biotechnology and material science, it is reasonable to believe that personalized programmable stents will become the mainstream in cardiovascular disease treatment in the near future, safeguarding patients' cardiovascular health.</p>
