            <h2>Gravitational Waves: An Rhythm Detector of the Universe</h2>
            <p>Gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of spacetime, have become a new tool for humanity to explore the mysteries of the universe since their first direct detection in 2015. They not only verified Einstein's predictions in general relativity but also, in their unique way, connected micro and macro physics, ushering in a new era of multi-messenger astronomy.</p>
