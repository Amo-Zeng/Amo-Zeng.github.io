            <h2>Food Anxiety in the Digital Era: A Comprehensive Breakdown from Rumor Spreading to Grassroots Communication</h2>
            <p>In the digital era, with the flourishing development of social media, the speed and coverage of food safety information dissemination have reached unprecedented heights. However, this progress is accompanied by information overload, the proliferation of rumors, and increasing public anxiety. This phenomenon not only obscures the public's correct perception of food safety but also further undermines consumer trust in the food supply chain. The communication patterns of food safety risks have evolved from the traditional "avoidance of harm" to more complex multi-layered challenges, especially in grassroots areas where the "last mile" of information dissemination is particularly prominent and urgently needs to be addressed.</p>

            <h3>1. Food Anxiety in the Social Media Era: Rumor Spreading and Trust Crises</h3>
            <p>Social media platforms with low thresholds and anonymity provide fertile ground for the proliferation of rumors. Food safety rumors can typically be categorized as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Exaggerated Rumors:</strong> These exaggerate individual events to provoke widespread panic.</li>
                <li><strong>Pseudoscientific Rumors:</strong> These rumors wear a "scientific" cloak, using complex terminology and pseudoscientific theories to increase credibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotionally Driven Rumors:</strong> These spread rapidly by evoking emotional resonance among the public.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The spread of these rumors relies on the viral effect of social media, group polarization, and information asymmetry. The public, lacking professional knowledge of food safety, is more easily misled by simplistic "conclusion-based rumors" when faced with complex scientific issues. This phenomenon not only intensifies public food anxiety but also further erodes trust in the food supply chain, creating a vicious cycle.</p>

            <h3>2. From "Avoiding Harm" to "Pursuing Benefits": Redefining Food Safety Risk Communication</h3>
            <p>The traditional "avoidance of harm" risk communication model, which focuses on warning and informing the public about unsafe foods to avoid, may garner public attention in the short term but often falls short in the long run. To overcome this limitation, food safety risk communication needs to shift from "avoiding harm" to "pursuing benefits," guiding consumers to focus on the positive impacts of food safety.</p>
            <p>Behavioral economics研究表明 that human decision-making is not entirely rational but influenced by psychological factors such as "loss aversion" and "status quo bias." Therefore, when designing food safety risk communication strategies, the theories of behavioral economics can be leveraged to create more targeted strategies.</p>

            <h3>3. The "Last Mile" Challenge: Addressing Grassroots Communication Barriers</h3>
            <p>Despite significant resources invested in food safety regulation and risk management at the national level, information often faces communication barriers in the "last mile" when reaching grassroots consumers. This phenomenon is particularly prominent in regions with limited information channels and varying public literacy levels.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Limited Information Channels:</strong> Internet access is less prevalent in grassroots areas, leading to slower information updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Weak Public Food Safety Awareness:</strong> Many grassroots residents have a vague understanding of food safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Disconnection Between Content and Audience Needs:</strong> Food safety risk communication content is often too professional and theoretical.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>4. Comprehensive Solutions: Overcoming Grassroots Communication Barriers</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Leveraging Traditional and New Media:</strong> Use traditional media such as radio and television to disseminate food safety knowledge, while utilizing new media platforms like short video apps to expand reach.</li>
                <li><strong>Conducting Community Activities and Grassroots Training:</strong> Regularly organize "food safety in the community" events, inviting experts to explain food safety knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>Designing Grounded Communication Content:</strong> Use storytelling and comics to make food safety knowledge more relatable and engaging.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>5. Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Food safety risk communication in the digital era faces unprecedented challenges, from rumor spreading on social media to information transmission barriers in grassroots areas. Each step requires precise strategies and innovative thinking. By constructing a "pursuing benefits" model for food safety risk communication and overcoming the "last mile" of grassroots communication, we can effectively guide consumers to rationally view food safety risks, enhance their awareness and confidence in food safety, and promote the healthy development of the food industry. Ultimately, this will realize the vision of "food safety for all."</p>
