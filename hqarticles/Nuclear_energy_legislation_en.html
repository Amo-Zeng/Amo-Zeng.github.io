            <h2>Global Evolution of Nuclear Regulations and Public Trust Building</h2>
            <p>The global evolution of nuclear regulations not only reflects technological advances and changes in energy demand but is also crucial for building public trust. This article delves into the complex system of nuclear regulations from the initial stages to the present day, analyzes the challenges faced, and proposes forward-looking recommendations, emphasizing the central role of transparency and public participation in the formulation of nuclear regulations.</p>

            <h3>Historical Trajectory of Nuclear Regulations and Contemporary Challenges</h3>
            <p>The origins of nuclear regulations can be traced back to the 1950s when the international community focused on nuclear military applications. With the expansion into civil sectors, the establishment of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1957 marked the beginning of international cooperation. By the 1960s and 1970s, the rapid development of nuclear power plants prompted a refinement of regulations, covering the entire process from design, construction, operation to decommissioning.</p>

            <h3>Public Trust Building and the Transparency of Regulations</h3>
            <p>Public concerns about nuclear energy mainly center on safety incidents and nuclear waste disposal. IAEA safety standards and guidelines require strict compliance to ensure nuclear safety. Post-Fukushima, the global regulatory adjustments not only enhance safety levels but also rebuild public trust. The transparency and openness of regulations are key, with public consultations by ENSREG ensuring that public opinions are fully considered in regulatory formulation.</p>

            <h3>Diversity and Coordination of Nuclear Regulations from a Global Perspective</h3>
            <p>The diversity and unity of nuclear regulations are particularly critical in a global context. The universality of global standards lies in the consistent pursuit of safety, but regional differences are significant. European and American regulations are bound by stringent environmental legal frameworks, while Asia prioritizes energy security and supply stability. International organizations like the IAEA promote regulatory convergence by formulating and disseminating international standards, with countries needing to enhance exchanges and cooperation to balance national sovereignty and global common interests.</p>

            <h3>Forward-Looking Recommendations and Future Pathways of Public Participation</h3>
            <p>Future regulatory formulation should be more flexible and forward-looking to adapt to rapid technological and environmental changes. Regulatory agencies should continuously monitor technological development trends and update regulations accordingly to ensure future safety and sustainable development of nuclear energy.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Strengthening International Cooperation and Technology Sharing</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Transparency and Public Participation</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility and Forward-Looking Nature of Regulations</strong></li>
