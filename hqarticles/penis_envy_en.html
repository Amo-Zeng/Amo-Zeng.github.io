            <h2>Multidimensional Interpretation of Penis Envy</h2>
            <p>Penis envy, a concept proposed by Sigmund Freud, refers to the female desire or jealousy for the male genitalia. Although this theory has been widely criticized and questioned in modern gender studies, its core idea—the complex relationship between physical characteristics and gender identity—still holds significant value in the context of gender diversity. Penis envy has transcended mere physical comparison, evolving into a multidimensional phenomenon involving gender identity, social power, cultural symbols, and mental health. This article will explore the multifaceted meanings of penis envy and its impact on individuals and society from three perspectives: the complexity of gender identity, the symbolism of cultural symbols and social power, and the challenges of mental health and self-acceptance.</p>

            <h3>1. The Complexity of Gender Identity and Penis Envy</h3>
            <p>In traditional views, biological sex and gender identity are often considered closely linked. However, with the development of gender theory, people have gradually come to understand gender identity as a more complex psychological and social construct. For some, their physical characteristics do not align with their deep-seated gender identity, which can lead to intense internal conflict.</p>
            <h4>1.1 Conflict Between Physical Characteristics and Gender Identity</h4>
            <p>Transgender men (assigned female at birth but identify as male) may experience a strong desire for a penis, as it is traditionally seen as a symbol of masculinity. This desire is not merely a physical need but also a confirmation and expression of gender identity. Similarly, non-binary individuals (who do not fit into the traditional male-female gender binary) may feel confused between physical characteristics and self-expression, and penis envy could become part of their exploration of self-identity.</p>
            <h4>1.2 Balancing Social Expectations and Self-Expression</h4>
            <p>In today's gender-diverse world, societal expectations of gender roles still exist, although they are gradually changing. Traditional gender norms associate the penis with masculinity, power, and dominance, while the absence of a penis is linked to femininity, submission, and dependency. These societal expectations have a profound impact on individual self-expression. For those who do not conform to traditional gender norms, penis envy may become a way to break these norms and pursue self-identification.</p>

            <h3>2. Cultural Symbols and the Symbolism of Social Power</h3>
            <p>Penis envy is not only a desire for male physical characteristics but also a desire for social power and status. By analyzing the symbolic meaning of the penis as a cultural symbol and its interaction with the structure of social power, we can reveal how gender inequality is reinforced through physical characteristics and influences individual self-perception and social behavior.</p>
            <h4>2.1 Symbolic Meaning of the Penis as a Cultural Symbol</h4>
            <p>In many cultures, the penis is not just a biological organ but also a part of cultural symbols, carrying rich connotations. Its image is often closely associated with power, strength, and virility. This symbolic meaning is not accidental but shaped by social history, religious beliefs, political structures, and other factors.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Relationship Between Penis Envy and Social Power Structures</h4>
            <p>Penis envy is not just a desire for male physical characteristics but also a desire for social power and status. This envy reflects the gender inequality in social power structures and how this inequality is reinforced and perpetuated through physical characteristics.</p>

            <h3>3. Mental Health and Challenges of Self-Acceptance</h3>
            <p>Penis envy can have a profound impact on an individual's mental health, especially when it leads to self-denial or damage to self-esteem. Through a psychological perspective, we can explore how to help individuals re-recognize their bodies, accept their gender characteristics, and find self-worth.</p>
            <h4>3.1 Mental Health Impacts of Penis Envy</h4>
            <p>Penis envy may stem from social and cultural stereotypes about gender characteristics and the excessive推崇男性气概T. In this context, individuals may be dissatisfied with their gender characteristics, leading to mental health issues.</p>
            <h4>3.2 Self-Acceptance and Psychological Therapy from a Psychological Perspective</h4>
            <p>Facing the psychological challenges brought by penis envy, psychological therapy provides a series of effective intervention strategies to help individuals re-recognize their bodies, accept their gender characteristics, and find self-worth.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Penis envy has transcended mere physical comparison, becoming a multidimensional phenomenon involving gender identity, social power, cultural symbols, and mental health. Through the complexity of gender identity, the symbolism of cultural symbols and social power, and the challenges of mental health and self-acceptance, we can gain a deeper understanding of the multifaceted meanings of penis envy and its impact on individuals and society.</p>
