            <h3>Environmental Sustainability and Carbon Footprint Tracking</h3>
            <p>The application of blockchain technology in environmental sustainability mainly focuses on the following aspects:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Transparency and Traceability:</strong> Blockchain records all data from the production to consumption of food, including energy consumption, transportation methods, packaging materials, etc. Consumers and businesses can transparently view the carbon footprint of food, thereby promoting a shift towards eco-friendly behaviors.</li>
                <li><strong>Eco-friendly Business Practices:</strong> Companies can leverage blockchain data to shift towards renewable energy, optimize supply chains to reduce unnecessary transport links, and innovate with sustainable packaging materials.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumer Behavior Change:</strong> With transparent carbon footprint information, consumers can choose more environmentally friendly products, driving market mechanisms to push companies towards green transformation.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term Effects and Future Outlook:</strong> Blockchain technology has the potential to drive the establishment of industry standards, promote global collaboration, and provide data support for government environmental policies.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Food Safety and Quality Control through Smart Contracts</h3>
            <p>The application of smart contracts in food safety and quality control offers the following advantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automation and Verification:</strong> Smart contracts can automatically monitor and enforce food safety standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Full Lifecycle Monitoring:</strong> Data from every stage, from raw material procurement to sale, is recorded, ensuring food safety throughout the supply chain.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Transparency and Reliability:</strong> Consumers can view the production and distribution process of food through blockchain.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Enhancing Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) and Localized Food Networks</h3>
            <p>The integration of blockchain technology with the CSA model has brought the following innovations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transparency and Fair Trade:</strong> Blockchain ensures direct transactions between farmers and consumers.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Sustainability:</strong> By reducing food transport distances, it supports the sustainable development of local economies.</li>
                <li><strong>Food Safety and Fairness:</strong> Blockchain records every step of food from planting to sale.</li>
                <li><strong>Future Outlook:</strong> Combined with IoT and big data, blockchain technology will further optimize agricultural production.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Blockchain technology is not just a technical tool; it redefines how the food industry operates, from environmental protection to food safety, to the sustainable development of community economies. In the future, as technology evolves further, blockchain will become a key force in driving the global food system towards transparency, environmental sustainability, and fairness.</p>
