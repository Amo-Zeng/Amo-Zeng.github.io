            <h2>The Ritual of Blood: Historical Reflections and Modern Lessons on Bloodletting Therapy</h2>
            <p>Bloodletting therapy, a treatment method spanning the medical histories of both the East and the West, serves as a historical prism reflecting how human understanding of the essence of life evolves with the progress of civilization. It is not merely a medical practice for curing diseases, but also a significant testament to the evolution of human perspectives on life, science, and ethics. From the ancient Egyptian theory of humoral balance to the evidence-based practices of modern medicine, the rise and fall of bloodletting therapy offers a unique perspective to examine the interplay and conflict between science and ethics in medical practice, as well as the hidden power dynamics in doctor-patient relationships.</p>

            <h3>1. The Scientific Foundation of Bloodletting Therapy: From Humoral Theory to the Disenchantment of Modern Medicine</h3>
            <p>The theoretical foundation of bloodletting therapy is deeply rooted in the humoral theory of ancient Greece. The Hippocratic school believed that human health depended on the dynamic balance of blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. When these humors were imbalanced, bloodletting could remove the "excess" blood to restore equilibrium. This theory was further reinforced in the medieval European medical system, becoming a core concept of Galenic medicine. Physicians believed that bloodletting could remove "black bile" from the body, thereby curing diseases.</p>
            <p>However, with the advancement of modern science, the scientific validity of bloodletting therapy was severely questioned. The humoral theory itself lacked empirical support, and its explanation of diseases was overly simplistic, ignoring the complex physiological mechanisms of the human body. In practice, bloodletting therapy not only failed to effectively treat diseases but also led to numerous adverse outcomes, such as anemia, infections, and even death. This clinical failure marked the gradual abandonment of bloodletting therapy by modern medicine.</p>
            <p>The rise and fall of bloodletting therapy reflect the evolution and replacement of scientific theories. As Thomas Kuhn stated in his classic work *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*, scientific revolutions often involve the collapse of old paradigms and the rise of new ones. The decline of bloodletting therapy is a classic case of this process, revealing how scientific theories are gradually phased out through interaction with practice, and how new knowledge is established through empirical research and clinical validation.</p>

            <h3>2. The Ethical Dilemmas of Bloodletting Therapy: Ethical Boundaries in the Power Dynamics of Doctor-Patient Relationships</h3>
            <p>Bloodletting therapy is not just a part of medical technology but also a mirror reflecting the essence of doctor-patient relationships. During the era when bloodletting was prevalent, the power of physicians reached unprecedented heights. They were not only healers but also rulers of patients' bodies. The physicians' unwavering belief in bloodletting translated into direct interventions on patients' bodies. In this power structure, patients were forced into passive roles, and their autonomy in medical decisions was quietly stripped away.</p>
            <p>Although this power relationship was cloaked in the guise of "healing," it inherently eroded patient autonomy. The widespread use of bloodletting therapy created a unique form of doctor-patient relationship. Physicians, leveraging their professional knowledge, dominated the treatment process. They decided the amount and location of bloodletting based on "professional judgment," while patients had no choice but to comply unconditionally. This one-sided model turned medical practice into an authority-driven enforcement.</p>
            <p>In this context, patient participation was minimized. They could neither challenge the treatment plan nor express their concerns and fears. This severe imbalance in information and power transformed the doctor-patient relationship into one of paternalistic dominance and submission. The physicians' blind confidence in the efficacy of treatment further reinforced this unequal relationship structure.</p>

            <h3>3. The Boundary Between Science and Ethics: Modern Lessons from Bloodletting Therapy</h3>
            <p>The rise and fall of bloodletting therapy provide an excellent case for reflecting on the boundary between science and ethics. First, science and ethics are not diametrically opposed but are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Scientific progress requires ethical guidance to ensure it does not deviate from the right path in practice, while ethical development needs scientific support to ensure it is built on a solid foundation.</p>
            <p>Second, medical decisions should be based on thorough communication and consultation between doctors and patients. Physicians should respect patient autonomy, provide them with sufficient information, patiently address their concerns, and jointly develop treatment plans. Medical practice must be patient-centered rather than centered on the physician's professional judgment. The ideal doctor-patient relationship should be one of equal partnership rather than unidirectional authority.</p>
            <p>Finally, the advancement of medical technology should not come at the cost of patient rights. The selection of any treatment plan should be conducted with respect for life and humanity. Modern medicine must find a balance between technological progress and humanistic care, building a truly patient-centered healthcare system.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The history of bloodletting therapy is not just a narrative of the evolution of medical technology but also a story of the intertwining of science and ethics. It reveals the limitations of scientific theories and the complexities of ethical practice, providing an important perspective for examining modern medical practice. In an era of rapid scientific development, we must remain vigilant to ensure a balance and harmony between science and ethics in medical practice, achieving true medical progress and human welfare.</p>
            <p>This history teaches us that while the advancement of medical technology is important, it is even more crucial to uphold the ethical bottom line of humanism in the application of technology, allowing medicine to truly become a bridge that benefits humanity. The rise and fall of bloodletting therapy is not only a reflection on the past but also an inspiration for the future: as we pursue medical progress, we must always remember that patients are not passive recipients but equal participants in medical decision-making.</p>
