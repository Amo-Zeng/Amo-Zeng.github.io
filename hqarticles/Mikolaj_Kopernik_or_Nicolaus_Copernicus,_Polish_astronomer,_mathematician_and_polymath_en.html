            <h2>Copernicus and Humanism in the Renaissance Period</h2>
            <p>During the Renaissance, humanism emerged, emphasizing individual dignity, rational thinking, and critical analysis. Copernicus's "De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium" was not only a revolution in astronomy but also a concrete practice of humanism in the scientific field.</p>

            <h3>The Development of Copernicus's Theory and Scientific Methodology</h3>
            <p>Copernicus's heliocentrism was not an accidental inspiration but the result of long-term observation, critical thinking, and systematic research. His scientific methodology embodies rigorous logical reasoning, a focus on empirical data, and a challenge to authority.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The connection between Copernicus and humanism during the Renaissance period is a paradigm of the intersection of science and humanities. His scientific methodology, like a revolutionary seed, was sown in the soil of science, ultimately nurturing the towering tree of modern science.</p>
