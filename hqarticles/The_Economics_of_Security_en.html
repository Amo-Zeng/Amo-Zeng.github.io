            <h2>Security Depreciation: A New Paradigm of Dynamic Security Management</h2>
            <h3>Concept and Core Ideas of Security Depreciation</h3>
            <p>Security depreciation, an essential concept in security economics, reveals that security measures are not a one-time investment. Over time, technological advancement, and environmental changes, previously effective security measures gradually become ineffective or "depreciate." This "depreciation" is not only reflected in physical aspects such as equipment aging and technology obsolescence but also in the dynamic and complex nature of security threats. For example, a firewall in cybersecurity may become ineffective against new attack methods, and industrial safety equipment may deteriorate over long-term use, reducing its protective capabilities.</p>
            <p>The core idea of security depreciation is that security protection is a continuous evolutionary process rather than a one-time investment. Enterprises and society must establish a dynamic security management model, regularly assess the effectiveness of existing measures, identify their "depreciation" level, and update and upgrade them in a timely manner to address ever-changing security threats. This dynamic management model can not only enhance protection effectiveness but also minimize potential security incidents and economic losses.</p>
            <h3>Practical Application Cases</h3>
            <h4>Cybersecurity Field</h4>
            <p>In the cybersecurity field, the phenomenon of security depreciation is particularly prominent. As hacking techniques evolve and new attack methods emerge, previously effective protective measures often become ineffective. For instance, the 2017 "WannaCry" ransomware attack crippled hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide, causing significant losses to many enterprises due to the lack of timely updates to their protection systems.</p>
            <h5>Case 1: Cybersecurity Depreciation at a Financial Institution</h5>
            <p>A large financial institution invested heavily in advanced firewalls and intrusion detection systems in 2015. However, as hacking techniques advanced, these systems gradually exposed vulnerabilities. In 2020, the institution suffered a severe cyberattack, resulting in the leakage of a large amount of customer data and direct economic losses of millions of dollars. Post-analysis showed that the institution's security systems, having not been updated in time, had significantly "depreciated," rendering them unable to cope with new threats.</p>
            <h4>Industrial Safety Field</h4>
            <p>In the industrial safety field, equipment aging and the failure of protective measures are typical manifestations of security depreciation. For example, safety equipment in chemical plants may deteriorate due to long-term use, reducing protective capabilities and potentially leading to major accidents.</p>
            <h5>Case 2: Security Depreciation Accident at a Chemical Plant</h5>
            <p>A chemical plant purchased a set of advanced safety equipment in 2010. However, over time, the equipment aged significantly, and the plant failed to maintain and update it in a timely manner. In 2018, the plant experienced a severe chemical leak accident, resulting in significant casualties and environmental pollution. Investigation revealed that equipment aging was the primary cause of the accident.</p>
            <h4>Public Safety Field</h4>
            <p>The public safety field also faces security depreciation issues. For instance, urban surveillance systems may become outdated over time, unable to cope with new threats.</p>
            <h5>Case 3: Depreciation of a City's Traffic Monitoring System</h5>
            <p>A major city built an advanced traffic monitoring system in 2012. However, as traffic volume increased and new traffic violation methods emerged, the system gradually revealed technical limitations. In 2021, a severe traffic accident went undetected, delaying rescue efforts and resulting in significant casualties.</p>
            <h3>Future Outlook on Security Depreciation</h3>
            <p>Against the backdrop of rapid technological advancements, the concept of security depreciation will play an increasingly important role in future security management:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Intelligent Security Assessment and Updates</strong>: By leveraging artificial intelligence and big data technologies, enterprises can assess the "depreciation" level of security measures in real-time and automatically trigger the update process.</li>
                <li><strong>Security as a Service (SecaaS) Model</strong>: Enterprises can obtain the latest protective measures through subscription services, reducing costs and ensuring they remain up-to-date.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration Between Government and Enterprises</strong>: Governments can provide support to enterprises through policies and public platforms, promoting research and investment in security depreciation.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Internalization of Security Externalities: Theory, Practice, and Future Outlook</h2>
            <h3>Theoretical Foundation of Internalization of Security Externalities</h3>
            <h4>Externalities and Market Failure</h4>
            <p>Externalities lead to market failure because market mechanisms cannot fully reflect external costs or benefits. In the security field, enterprises may pursue short-term profits at the expense of safe production, leading to frequent accidents and increasing societal costs.</p>
            <h4>Economic Principles of Internalization</h4>
            <p>Through taxes, legal responsibilities, market mechanisms, and other means, externalities are incorporated into the decision-making framework of the principal, thereby optimizing security investments.</p>
            <h4>Economic Models</h4>
            <p>By modifying the enterprise production function, internalizing security externalities optimizes security investments and enhances overall social welfare.</p>
            <h3>Practical Application Cases</h3>
            <h4>Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)</h4>
            <p>OSHA enforces strict standards and regulations to internalize security externalities in enterprises, reducing workplace accidents.</p>
            <h4>Product Safety and Liability Insurance</h4>
            <p>Liability insurance internalizes the costs of product safety incidents, encouraging enterprises to prioritize product safety.</p>
            <h4>Environmental Safety and Carbon Emission Trading</h4>
            <p>Carbon emission trading systems set quotas and internalize costs, incentivizing enterprises to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
            <h3>Future Outlook</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Technological Advancements and Security Management</strong>: IoT, AI, and big data technologies will drive the internalization of security risks.</li>
