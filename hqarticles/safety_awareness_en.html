            <h3>I. Digital Survival Skills: Facing New Challenges in Cybersecurity</h3>
            <p>The advent of the digital age has expanded the scope of security awareness beyond traditional physical security into the vast domain of digital security. Digital survival skills, as an emerging direction in security awareness training, aim to help individuals and organizations effectively manage the growing cyber risks.</p>

            <h3>II. Behavioral Economics and Security Awareness: The Power of Rational Decision Making</h3>
            <p>Behavioral economics is a discipline that combines psychology with economics to study decision-making behaviors under uncertainty and risk. Applying this theory to security awareness not only helps us understand why people make irrational choices regarding security but also provides new perspectives and strategies to enhance security awareness.</p>
            <ol>

                <li><strong>Overconfidence:</strong> People overestimate their judgment abilities and underestimate risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Utilizing the Anchoring Effect:</strong> Influence decisions by providing an "anchor".</li>
                <li><strong>Social Norms:</strong> Use social pressure to encourage individuals to adhere to safety standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Framing Effect:</strong> Change the way information is presented to influence decision-making.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>III. Culture and Security Awareness: Security Integration in a Multicultural Context</h3>
            <p>In the context of globalization, there are significant differences in how security awareness is perceived and practiced across different cultures. Culture not only affects individual risk perception and handling methods but also determines the security culture and norms within an organization.</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Cultural Activities and Security Awareness:</strong> Organize various cultural activities to increase employees' security awareness and understanding of different cultures.</li>
                <li><strong>Case Studies and Cultural Adaptation:</strong> Analyze security cases from different cultural backgrounds to help employees understand and learn how to make secure decisions in multicultural environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Leadership's Cultural Demonstration:</strong> The role of company leadership in demonstrating security practices in multicultural environments is crucial.</li>
            </ul>
