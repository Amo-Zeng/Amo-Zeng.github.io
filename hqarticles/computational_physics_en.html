            <h2>From Simulation to Intelligence: The Paradigm Shift in Scientific Discovery</h2>
            <p>Traditional scientific research relies on precise mathematical models and numerical simulations. However, when faced with complex systems, nonlinear problems, and massive datasets, traditional computational methods gradually reveal their limitations. For example, in computational physics, traditional numerical simulation methods excel in deterministic problems but often face significant challenges such as high computational resource consumption and insufficient model generalization in complex scenarios like quantum many-body problems and climate change modeling.</p>
            <p>The introduction of artificial intelligence provides new solutions for scientific research. Deep learning, by automatically extracting features and identifying hidden patterns from vast amounts of data through multi-layer neural networks, demonstrates unique advantages in the study of complex systems.</p>
