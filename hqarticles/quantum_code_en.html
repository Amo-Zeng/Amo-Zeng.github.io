            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the information age, data security has become a core concern across various fields. With the rapid development of quantum computing, traditional cryptography faces significant threats, while blockchain technology offers new solutions for data integrity and transparency. The combination of quantum cryptography and blockchain is not only a strategy to tackle future computational challenges but also a revolutionary change in the field of information security. This article will delve into the integration of these two technologies from the perspectives of theoretical foundations, technical implementations, and future application prospects.</p>

            <h2>I. Principles and Challenges of Quantum Cryptography</h2>
            <p>Quantum cryptography utilizes phenomena from quantum mechanics such as quantum entanglement and superposition to achieve cryptographic goals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)</strong>: Transmitting keys through quantum states, where any eavesdropping would alter the quantum state and be detected. However, QKD faces physical limitations in practical applications, like photon loss and noise interference, which require quantum error correction and enhancement techniques to overcome.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantum Entanglement</strong>: This phenomenon provides a theoretically absolutely secure method of information transmission, but challenges like distance and environmental interference need to be addressed.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>II. Blockchain Technology: The Foundation of Decentralized Security</h2>
            <p>Blockchain, with its decentralized, transparent, and immutable characteristics, has become a revolutionary tool for modern data management and transaction recording:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Decentralization</strong>: Through consensus mechanisms, it ensures that every participant can verify transactions, avoiding single points of failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Transactions are public on a ledger, enhancing trust and auditability.</li>
                <li><strong>Immutability</strong>: Once data is written to the blockchain, altering it is nearly impossible.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Contracts</strong>: Automate contract execution, reducing human errors and manipulation.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h2>III. Deep Integration of Quantum Cryptography and Blockchain</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Key Management and Distribution</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Blockchain can serve as a key management platform for QKD systems, providing higher security and scalability.</li>
                        <li>Encrypting blockchain transactions with keys generated by QKD ensures privacy and security of transactions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Quantum Resistance</strong>:
                    <p>Current blockchain encryption algorithms might be vulnerable to quantum computers, and quantum cryptography offers a method to counter this threat.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Privacy and Security</strong>:
                    <p>Combining quantum cryptography can implement more complex privacy protection mechanisms, such as quantum blind signatures and quantum zero-knowledge proofs.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Security of Smart Contracts</strong>:
                    <p>Quantum cryptography can provide a secure execution environment for smart contracts that is difficult for quantum computing to break.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
