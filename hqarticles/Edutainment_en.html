            <h2>Redefining the Boundaries of Edutainment</h2>
            <p>In traditional education models, learning is often perceived as a serious task that requires students to exert effort and focus to acquire knowledge and skills. However, with the advancement of technology and the evolution of educational philosophies, the concept of "gamified learning" has gradually emerged, aiming to enhance learner engagement and motivation by introducing gaming elements and mechanics into educational environments. Although gamified learning has achieved some success, it still views gaming as an auxiliary tool for learning rather than learning itself.</p>

            <h3>Minecraft Education Edition: The Perfect Blend of Education and Entertainment</h3>
            <p>Minecraft Education Edition serves as a prime example, showcasing the immense potential of "learning through gaming." This game integrates subjects such as programming, history, and geography into an open-world environment, allowing students to learn through exploration, building, and problem-solving. Within this virtual world, students are no longer passive recipients of knowledge but active explorers and creators. They need to apply their learned knowledge to solve practical problems, such as constructing historical scenarios, simulating geographical environments, and programming robots. In this process, educational goals and entertainment experiences merge, enabling students not only to acquire knowledge but also to enjoy the fun of learning.</p>

            <h3>Redefining the Boundaries of Education and Entertainment: Creating True "Edutainment" Games</h3>
            <p>To design true "edutainment" games that enable learners to naturally acquire knowledge and skills through immersive gaming experiences, educators and game developers need to break down traditional disciplinary boundaries and create entirely new learning experiences. This requires reflection on the following aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Immersive Experience:</strong> Edutainment games should offer highly immersive experiences, allowing students to fully immerse themselves in the virtual world and forget the constraints of the real world.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-World Connection:</strong> Edutainment games should be closely connected to the real world, enabling students to apply what they learn in the game to real-life situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized Learning:</strong> Edutainment games should provide personalized learning content and challenges based on students' interests, abilities, and learning styles, ensuring that every student can find a suitable learning path.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration and Competition:</strong> Edutainment games should encourage collaboration and competition among students, fostering learning through interaction and growth through competition.</li>
            </ul>
