            <h2>Introduction: The Multifaceted Meaning of Incompletion</h2>
            <p>In the vast ocean of literature, 'incomplete' works are like uncharted islands, silently awaiting exploration by readers and researchers. These works may not have realized the author's original vision, or they may only leave behind unfinished blanks. Yet, it is precisely these states of 'incompletion' that provide us with a window into the author's inner world. They not only record the author's spiritual struggles and creative journey but also reveal their ultimate thoughts on life, society, and existence. As exemplified by Kafka's 'The Castle,' 'incompletion' is not a regret but another form of completion, a courageous writing of unfulfilled aspirations. Moreover, re-examining these 'incomplete' works through a contemporary lens allows us to discover new era significance and value embedded within them.</p>

            <h3>1. The Incomplete 'The Castle': Kafka's Meditations on Power and Existence</h3>
            <p>Franz Kafka's unfinished masterpiece, 'The Castle,' is one of the most famous 'incomplete' works in literary history. In his final moments, Kafka asked his friend Max Brod to destroy all his manuscripts. However, Brod defied this request and published 'The Castle' along with other works. The novel tells the story of a land surveyor, K, who attempts to enter the castle but fails to do so by the last page, with the castle's truth remaining shrouded in mystery.</p>
            <p>The 'incomplete' state of 'The Castle' is precisely what gives it its unique value. The castle in the novel symbolizes the core of power and bureaucracy, while K's failure suggests the individual's powerlessness in the face of a vast power structure. Kafka, through this unfinished narrative, reveals profound thoughts on the absurdity of the world and the essence of human existence. The castle's unreachability and the open-ended conclusion of the story are abstract representations of human困境 in modern society: humans perpetually pursue a goal yet never truly attain it.</p>
            <p>From a contemporary perspective, the themes of 'The Castle' remain highly relevant. In modern society, individual powerlessness stems not only from bureaucratic oppression but also from the multiple controls of technology, capital, and information. We may no longer face Kafka's castle, but we live in 'invisible castles' constructed by data, algorithms, and power.</p>

            <h3>2. Incompletion and Kafka's Spiritual Struggles: From Biography to 'Other' Perspective</h3>
            <p>Kafka's life experiences were closely intertwined with his creative philosophy. Born into a Jewish family, the powerful image of his father remained a shadow in his subconscious. This feeling of paternal oppression permeates many of his works, especially 'The Castle.' Under such oppression, Kafka's exploration of self-identity remained in an 'incomplete' state. In his diary, he wrote, "Writing is the only proof of my existence." However, this writing was not for completing a goal but for finding oneself in the process of writing.</p>
            <p>Kafka's creative philosophy also reflects his deep understanding of 'incompletion.' He did not pursue traditional narrative completeness but revealed the complexity and uncertainty of life itself through fragmented narratives and open-ended conclusions. This creative approach elevated his works beyond mere plot narration, transforming them into philosophical discussions on human existence status. The incompleteness of 'The Castle' is a concrete expression of Kafka's unanswerable questions about self and the world.</p>
            <p>From the perspective of 'others,' Kafka's image becomes more multidimensional. His friend Brod once recalled that Kafka was an extremely sensitive person who often fell into anxiety due to external criticism or pressure. This fragility is deeply expressed in Kafka's works, particularly in his revelations about human困境 and exploration of unfulfilled aspirations.</p>

            <h3>3. A Dialogue Across Time: From Lu Xun to Contemporary Society</h3>
            <p>In discussions about 'incomplete' works, we can also draw inspiration from the classic Chinese writer Lu Xun. Although Lu Xun's 'Diary of a Madman' appears to be a complete work, its open-ended conclusion and critique of an 'incomplete' society give it a strong 'incomplete' quality. By portraying the symbolic character of 'the madman,' Lu Xun reveals the spiritual困境 of Chinese society: on one hand, the oppression and destruction of individuals by feudal rituals; on the other hand, the numbness and ignorance of the populace.</p>
            <p>In contemporary contexts, the themes of 'Diary of a Madman' remain highly relevant. First, Lu Xun's critique of a 'cannibal' society still resonates today. In contemporary society, individuals facing multiple oppressions of power, capital, and technology often find themselves in a 'being eaten' or 'eating others' predicament. For example, in the information age, internet giants monopolize data resources, and ordinary individuals lose privacy and autonomy in the digital torrent, becoming tools of capital 'eating others.' This social phenomenon parallels Lu Xun's 'cannibal' society.</p>
            <p>Second, Lu Xun's call for 'enlightenment' and 'awakening' also has new meanings in contemporary society. In modern society, the awakening of individual consciousness is not only a pursuit of personal freedom but also a demand for social justice and human rights protection. However, the complexity of contemporary society lies in the fact that the cost of enlightenment often results in individual helplessness and loneliness in the face of a vast social machine. This parallels the predicament of 'the madman' after awakening in Lu Xun's work.</p>

            <h3>4. Enlightenment from Incomplete Works: Unfulfilled Aspirations in Creation and Life</h3>
            <p>The value of 'incomplete' works lies in their breaking of the traditional literary paradigm of 'completion' and 'ending,' revealing the complexity and openness of creation and life. As exemplified by Kafka's works, life is not a journey with a clear endpoint but a process of continuous exploration, repeated failures, and renewed beginnings. 'Incompletion' is not only a faithful record of the author's spirit but also an invitation to readers' thoughts: does our own life and creation also exist in a state of 'incompletion'?</p>
            <p>In contemporary society, the concept of 'incompletion' applies not only to literary creation but also to individual life journeys. Each of us has unfulfilled aspirations, unfinished dreams, and goals. It is precisely these 'incomplete' states that give our lives drive and meaning. As Kafka and Lu Xun's works suggest, 'incompletion' is not a regret but a profound insight into the essence of life. This insight may be the most valuable gift literature offers us.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Unique Value and Modern Enlightenment of Incomplete Works</h3>
            <p>'Incomplete' works are another form of presenting the author's spirit. They not only record the author's creative journey but also reveal their profound thoughts on the world and their persistent pursuit of unfulfilled aspirations. Kafka's 'The Castle' and Lu Xun's 'Diary of a Madman,' through their incomplete states, showcase the authors' ultimate reflections on power, existence, and human困境, becoming a literary monument.</p>
            <p>By interpreting 'incomplete' works, we can not only deepen our understanding of the author's creative spirit but also draw inspiration: life and creation are often not a linear completion process but a journey full of unknown explorations. As Kafka and Lu Xun demonstrate, 'incompletion' is not a regret but a profound insight into the essence of life. This insight may be the most valuable gift literature offers us.</p>
