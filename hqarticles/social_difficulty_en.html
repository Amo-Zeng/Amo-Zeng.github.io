            <h2>Introduction: The Power of Data and a New Perspective on Social Change</h2>
            <p>When discussing the future of society, we often focus on overt factors such as economics, environment, and politics. However, the invisible power hidden in the digital world—data—is frequently overlooked. Meanwhile, intergenerational conflicts and global crises are seen as intractable contradictions. But if we shift our perspective and view data, intergenerational relationships, and global challenges as resources for co-creating the future of society, we might be able to open up a new model of social development. This article explores how to transition from a "data dilemma" to "data enabling," from "intergenerational conflict" to "intergenerational co-creation," and ultimately achieve "co-evolution" to reshape the shared destiny of humanity.</p>

            <h2>Part I: Disrupting the Perspective—From "Data Dilemma" to "Data Enabling"</h2>
            <p>Data, as the "oil" of the digital era, brings unprecedented opportunities while quietly exacerbating social inequalities.</p>
            <h3>1. Data Divide and Algorithmic Bias</h3>
            <p>The data divide refers to significant gaps in the abilities of different groups to access, understand, and use data due to technological, economic, educational differences. This not only leads to unequal access to information but further exacerbates social stratification. Meanwhile, algorithmic biases often show discriminatory tendencies in areas such as recruitment, loans, and judicial rulings, further intensifying social injustice.</p>
            <h3>2. Data Enabling: A New Tool to Crack Social Dilemmas</h3>
            <p>Although the "data dilemma" presents many challenges, data itself is not the root of the problem but a new perspective for understanding and solving problems. By leveraging data appropriately, we can transition from "data dilemma" to "data enabling," opening a new chapter in social governance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Using data analysis to reveal the root causes of social issues and implement targeted policies</strong>: Traditional social governance often relies on experience and intuition, which is difficult to address the deeper roots of problems. Data analysis provides the possibility for precise diagnoses of social issues. For example, by analyzing the correlation between community crime rates and variables such as environmental factors and demographic structure, governments can develop more targeted preventive measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting information sharing and enhancing public participation through big data platforms</strong>: Data is not just a resource but also a connecting bond. By building big data platforms, governments, businesses, social organizations, and the public can achieve information sharing and collaboration, promoting democratic and transparent social governance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Part II: From "Intergenerational Conflict" to "Intergenerational Co-creation"</h2>
            <p>Intergenerational conflict is seen as a threat to social stability, with differences in perspectives and value conflicts between older and younger generations seemingly insurmountable. However, if we shift our perspective and view intergenerational conflict as a resource rather than a burden, we might be able to open up a new model of social development: intergenerational co-creation.</p>
            <h3>1. Knowledge and Experience Transmission</h3>
            <p>The older generation possesses rich social experience and historical wisdom, which are crucial for solving complex social problems. The younger generation's innovative thinking and technological capabilities can help transform these experiences into practical solutions.</p>
            <h3>2. Technology and Innovation Integration</h3>
            <p>The younger generation is often referred to as "digital natives," with natural advantages in technology application and innovation. Through intergenerational cooperation, the younger generation can develop products and services that better meet the needs of older adults, such as smart elderly care devices and convenient medical applications.</p>
            <h3>3. Multi-perspective Collaborative Creation</h3>
            <p>Different generations often have different understandings and perspectives on the same issue due to their life experiences and social environments. This multi-perspective collaborative creation can lead to more comprehensive and innovative solutions.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Part III: From "Global Crisis" to "Co-evolution"</h2>
            <p>In the face of increasingly severe global crises, we need a new perspective to examine the relationships between human society and the natural environment, technological development, and cultural concepts. This perspective is "co-evolution."</p>
            <h3>1. Harmony and Symbiosis Between Humans and Nature</h3>
            <p>In the perspective of co-evolution, humans and nature are no longer a subject-object relationship but a symbiotic relationship that mutually depends on and promotes each other. Through technological innovation, policy guidance, and lifestyle changes, we can achieve harmony and symbiosis with nature.</p>
            <h3>2. Technology Enabling Sustainable Development</h3>
            <p>In the perspective of co-evolution, technology is no longer a single tool but a complex system interacting with society, environment, and culture. Through technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data, we can promote social equity and sustainable development.</p>
            <h3>3. Multi-cultural Exchange and Prosperity</h3>
            <p>In the perspective of co-evolution, cultural diversity is not only a wealth but also an important driving force for promoting co-evolution. Through cultural dialogues, cultural creative industries, and cultural education, we can promote the exchange and integration of diverse cultures.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Part IV: Challenges and Implications—Building a Consensus on Data Ethics and Promoting Global Cooperation</h2>
            <p>Although "data enabling" presents broad prospects, issues such as data security, privacy protection, and algorithmic ethics cannot be ignored. Meanwhile, to achieve intergenerational co-creation and co-evolution, we need to eliminate intergenerational prejudices, promote mutual understanding and trust, and push for the reform and improvement of the global governance system.</p>
            <h3>1. Data Security and Privacy Protection</h3>
            <p>The use of data often comes with privacy infringement. By establishing strict privacy protection regulations and enhancing the protection of individual data rights, we can build a respectful, equitable, and transparent data usage environment.</p>
            <h3>2. Eliminating Intergenerational Prejudices and Promoting Mutual Understanding</h3>
            <p>Through intergenerational dialogues and exchange activities, different generations can have the opportunity to understand each other's perspectives and life experiences. By jointly participating in social projects and practical activities, mutual trust and cooperation can be enhanced.</p>
            <h3>3. Promoting the Reform of the Global Governance System</h3>
            <p>Countries should abandon narrow national interest perspectives and view global issues from the perspective of the shared destiny of humanity. The international community should strengthen cooperation, pushing for the reform and improvement of the global governance system to ensure equal and fair participation in global affairs.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: From "Data Dilemma" to "Data Enabling" and "Intergenerational Co-creation" to Achieve "Co-evolution"</h2>
            <p>Standing at the forefront of the digital era, we face challenges brought by the "data dilemma" and opportunities brought by "data enabling." By acknowledging the social issues brought by data and leveraging its power, we can transition from a "data dilemma" to "data enabling," opening a more equitable, efficient, and sustainable future. Meanwhile, through intergenerational co-creation and co-evolution, we will not only witness the alleviation of intergenerational conflicts but also see a more inclusive, innovative, and prosperous society. Ultimately, through the organic combination of data enabling, intergenerational co-creation, and co-evolution, we will reshape the shared destiny of humanity, collectively address global challenges, and build a better and sustainable future.</p>
