            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Traditional medical narratives often confine chronic illness to individual health issues, overlooking its profound impact as a reconstructor of social relations. Using role theory and actor-network theory as analytical frameworks, this article explores how chronic illness transforms patients' daily practices, subverts family power structures, and fosters new forms of intimacy in the digital age, offering fresh perspectives for understanding the social dimensions of chronic illness.</p>

            <h3>I. Family Power Dynamics: From "Decision-Maker" to "Decision Recipient"</h3>
            <h4>1. Reconstruction and Conflict in Intergenerational Power</h4>
            <p>The long-term care needs of chronic illness often disrupt traditional family power structures. In Chinese families, for example, when elderly patients lose financial decision-making capacity due to cognitive decline, adult children may take over their assets under the guise of "acting on their behalf," forming what Foucault termed "medicalized power." This shift represents both a reinterpretation of traditional filial piety and the deep penetration of modern medical discourse into family life.</p>
            <p>However, power transitions are not always smooth. A case from Shandong shows how disabled elders resist children's control by hiding medications, essentially fighting for their last vestiges of autonomy. This resistance reflects the "role conflict" in role theory: when socially expected roles (care recipient) clash with self-perceived roles (autonomous decision-maker), family relationships face challenges.</p>
            <h4>2. Technology-Mediated New Paradigm of Power Sharing</h4>
            <p>In families with young patients, technology is becoming a key mediator in power reconstruction. For children with type 1 diabetes, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology grants them unprecedented authority over body data. Parents must collaborate with 8-year-olds to interpret glucose curves, forming "technology-mediated power sharing." This new cooperative model embodies the core idea of actor-network theory: medical devices are no longer passive tools but active agents reshaping family relations.</p>

            <h3>II. Digital Intimacy: Subcultures and Practices in Online Communities</h3>
            <h4>1. Aesthetic Reconstruction of the "Technological Body"</h4>
            <p>Young chronic illness patients are carving out new spaces for identity expression in the digital economy. TikTok videos featuring "insulin pump fashion" (such as integrating pump devices with Hanfu waist accessories) are not just practical tips but rewrites of what Latour called "technical scripts." Medical devices transform from symbols of illness into media for personal expression, dissolving the stigmatized label of "patient" and forming an aesthetically resistant subculture.</p>
            <p>This practice also carries theoretical significance: it breaks through the limitations of Parsons' "sick role" theory, showing how chronic illness patients reconstruct self-identity through digital platforms, turning "medical technology" into "cultural capital."</p>
            <h4>2. Algorithmic Emotional Support Networks</h4>
            <p>When traditional kinship networks fail due to "healthy person fatigue," algorithm-driven online communities are reconstructing emotional support systems. On Xiaohongshu's diabetes topic pages, patients create "breakfast cup challenge" (tracking post-meal glucose fluctuations), transforming care burdens into visual achievement games. This digital intimacy features "weak ties with strong support": though community members may not know each other well, they provide precise emotional resonance and technical assistance.</p>

            <h3>III. Theoretical Perspectives: Illness as a Mediator of Social Relations</h3>
            <h4>1. Identity Renegotiation Through Role Theory</h4>
            <p>Parsons' concept of the "sick role" reveals limitations in chronic illness contexts: when "temporary exemption from responsibility" becomes permanent, patients must develop adaptive "chronic illness roles." Field research from a Chengdu Parkinson's support group shows members establishing "agentic patient" roles through regular meetings, gaining new social positioning beyond family and actively participating in public affairs.</p>
            <h4>2. Multiple Connections in Actor-Networks</h4>
            <p>Chronic illness treatment involves multiple actors: doctors, medications, wearable devices, insurance policies, etc. A rheumatoid arthritis patient's treatment choices may be jointly determined by: medication experiences shared in WeChat support groups, pain data from smartwatches, and financial considerations in family meetings. These non-human actors participate in shaping social relations just as humans do.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Social Healing Beyond Medical Frameworks</h3>
            <p>Chronic illness is not just a health issue but a process of reconstructing social relations. At the family level, we need "care democratization" mechanisms to facilitate power transition negotiations; digitally, we should value patient communities' knowledge production and incorporate them into formal healthcare information networks. Only by viewing chronic illness as a participatory reconstruction of social relations, rather than mere health deficits, can patients achieve true social healing.</p>
