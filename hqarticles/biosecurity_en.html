            <h2>Building a New Framework for Biosafety: From Passive Defense to Proactive Action for a Community of Shared Destiny</h2>
            <p>Biosafety, once confined within the walls of laboratories, has now become a broad proposition concerning human survival and development. The rapid advancement of globalization and technology has diversified the forms of biosafety threats, making their impact more profound and unprecedentedly global. The global pandemic of COVID-19, in an almost cruel manner, has sounded the alarm for us: in the face of biosafety threats, no country can remain unscathed, and the destinies of humanity are already closely intertwined.</p>

            <h3>Diverse Challenges in Biosafety: From Laboratories to Global Ecosystems</h3>
            <p>The scope of biosafety has long since transcended the walls of laboratories, permeating every aspect of our lives. From the fields of genetically edited crops to the dining table, from the protection of personal genetic information to social justice, biosafety has become a complex issue spanning science, ethics, and society.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Safety Assessment of Genetically Edited Crops:</strong> Technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 are hailed as revolutionary tools in agriculture. However, the advancement of technology always accompanies increased risks. The safety of consuming and the ecological impact of genetically edited crops have become focal points of public concern.</li>
                <li><strong>Security and Ethics of Personal Genetic Information:</strong> With the proliferation of genetic testing technologies, obtaining personal genetic information has become increasingly easy. However, the leakage of genetic information can lead to a series of ethical and social issues.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>From Passive Defense to Proactive Action: Building a New Biosafety Defense Line</h3>
            <p>Traditional biosafety strategies, akin to building a high wall, passively抵御抵御外来威胁。然而，在日益复杂的生物安全形势面前，这种“以静制动”的方式已显露出局限性。我们需要打破固有思维，从被动防御转向主动出击，构建起更具前瞻性、动态化和智能化的生物安全新防线。</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence: The "Smart Brain" for Biosafety Prevention and Control:</strong> AI can monitor, analyze, and mine biological data on a global scale in real-time, identifying potential outbreak points and virus mutation trends.</li>
                <li><strong>Building a Biosafety Risk Warning System:</strong> Biosafety risks are everywhere, from virus transmission in nature to accidental leaks in laboratories and even bioterrorist attacks, all of which can lead to severe consequences.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>A Community of Shared Destiny: Building a Global Biosafety Governance System</h3>
            <p>Throughout human history, viruses have always been intertwined with humanity, from smallpox and the Black Death to AIDS and Ebola, all narrating the long struggle between humans and pathogens. However, entering the 21st century, with the acceleration of globalization, changes in the ecological environment, and the rapid development of biotechnology, the forms of biosafety threats have become more diverse, their impact more profound, and their characteristics more globally unprecedented.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shared Threats: The Globalization of Biosafety Challenges:</strong> In the era of globalization, the rapid flow of people, goods, and information provides convenient channels for virus transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>A Community of Shared Destiny: Building a Global Biosafety Governance System:</strong> Facing common biosafety challenges, countries need to join hands to build a fairer and more reasonable global biosafety governance system.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Biosafety is no longer confined within the walls of laboratories. From the fields of genetically edited crops to the dining table, from the protection of personal genetic information to social justice, biosafety has become a complex issue spanning science, ethics, and society. Facing these challenges, we need to establish more robust evaluation systems and management mechanisms to ensure that technological progress does not cause irreversible damage to human health and the ecological environment. At the same time, we need to consider how to balance privacy and freedom, justice and efficiency in the application of technology, to achieve true biosafety.</p>
