            <h3>From Rebellion to Integration: The Evolution of Pop Art</h3>
            <p>The initial rebellious spirit of Pop Art stemmed from its challenge to traditional art and embrace of popular culture. Artists replicated and reassembled commercial symbols such as advertisements, comics, and everyday objects, aiming to blur the lines between art and life. Works like Andy Warhol's "Campbell's Soup Cans" and Roy Lichtenstein's "Crying Girl" represent this era.</p>
            <p>However, over time, the rebellious spirit of Pop Art has gradually given way to a trend of integration. Contemporary artists have begun to combine elements of Pop Art with other forms of art, creating new visual languages and expressions. This fusion not only enriches the techniques of Pop Art but also imbues it with new meanings and values.</p>
