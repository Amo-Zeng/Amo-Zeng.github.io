            <h3>The Intersection of Technology and Pop Art: A Revolution in Modern Art</h3>
            <p>Emerging in the late 1950s to early 1960s, Pop Art coincided with a period of rapid technological advancement. Technology not only changed the way art is created but also how it is disseminated and received.</p>
            <h4>Digital Tools and Artistic Creation</h4>
            <p>Pop artists like Andy Warhol used techniques of image repetition and simple printing to satirize consumer society. With the widespread use of digital technology, artists can now use tools like Photoshop and 3D modeling software for more precise and diverse creations.</p>
            <h4>New Media Art</h4>
            <p>Technological progress has spurred the rise of new media art, many works of which can be seen as extensions of Pop Art. New media art utilizes computers, the internet, virtual reality, and other technologies to create interactive, dynamic, and cross-media artworks.</p>
            <h4>The Digital Transformation of Art Distribution and Consumption</h4>
            <p>One of the original intentions of Pop Art was to bring art closer to the masses, eliminating the elitism of art. The proliferation of the internet further realized this concept.</p>
