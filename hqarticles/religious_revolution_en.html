            <h2>Reconstruction and Breakthrough: The Multidimensional Revolution of the Reformation</h2>
            <p>The Reformation of the 16th century was not only a transformative religious revolution in European history but also a profound movement that reshaped social, economic, and gender orders. This movement profoundly influenced the formation of the modern world through the catalysis of financial capital, the redefinition of gender roles, and the reconstruction of the global order.</p>

            <h3>I. The Catalysis of Financial Capital: The Deep Motivation of the Reformation</h3>
            <p>The outbreak of the Reformation was not accidental but an inevitable result of the accumulation of financial capital and the development of commodity economies. Europe in the 16th century was at a critical juncture in the germination of capitalism. The frequent circulation of money and the rise of financial capital made the Church's dependence on financial instruments, such as indulgences, increasingly obsolete.</p>
            <p>Financial capital was not only a catalyst for the Reformation but also an important source of support. Capitalists like the Fugger family of German bankers provided financial support, funded printing and publishing, and participated in political struggles, directly or indirectly propelling the reform process.</p>

            <h3>II. Gender Reconstruction: The Breakthrough and Challenges of Female Voices</h3>
            <p>In the tide of the Reformation, women were not entirely excluded from historical narratives. Instead, they participated in religious debates and reform movements with unique voices and actions, challenging existing gender orders.</p>
            <p>The breakthroughs of women in the Reformation were not only reflected in the intellectual sphere but also extended to education and the economy. Protestantism emphasized Bible reading and faith education, opening new avenues for women's religious learning and promoting the improvement of female literacy rates.</p>

            <h3>III. The Reconstruction of the Global Order: Religious Schism and the Formation of the Modern World</h3>
            <p>The Reformation not only triggered profound changes within Europe but also redefined the global order through religious schism. The split between Protestantism and Catholicism divided European nations into two camps, with religious differences becoming a significant driving force in inter-state competition.</p>
            <p>This competition was not only reflected in the争夺殖民地 but also in the construction of global trade networks. Protestant countries, with their flexible commercial policies and open religious attitudes, established a global economic system centered on free trade.</p>

            <h3>IV. The Genesis of Modernity: The Far-Reaching Impact of the Reformation</h3>
            <p>The Reformation, by reevaluating all values, provided important intellectual foundations for the genesis of modernity. The combination of Protestant ethics and the spirit of capitalism not only provided spiritual momentum for the development of modern capitalism but also spread globally through colonial expansion, promoting the modernization process in various regions.</p>
            <p>The historical experience of the Reformation shows that any major social change is not isolated but the result of the interplay of various social forces. In today's globalized world, reexamining the historical significance of the Reformation helps us better understand the complexity of the contemporary world and provides insights for the future development of human civilization.</p>
