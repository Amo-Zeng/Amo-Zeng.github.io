            <h2>The Evolution of W3C: From Technical Standards Setter to Global Internet Governance Leader</h2>
            <p>Since the inception of the World Wide Web in 1991, the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) has been dedicated to advancing Web technology. From its initial vision of "Web for All" to the grand goal of "Web for Every Thing" today, W3C's role has continuously evolved, expanding its mission from simply setting technical standards to becoming a leader in global internet governance. Throughout this journey, W3C has not only shaped the evolutionary trajectory of Web technology but also taken on the responsibility of building a responsible network ecosystem, becoming an important governance force in the digital era.</p>
