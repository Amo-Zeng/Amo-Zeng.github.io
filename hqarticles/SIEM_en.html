            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>With the深入推进 of enterprise digital transformation, the complexity and diversity of cybersecurity threats have grown exponentially. Traditional Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms, while providing a certain level of security for enterprises in the past, are increasingly showing their limitations due to their reliance on predefined rules and pattern matching, making them inadequate to cope with increasingly advanced and stealthy threats. Under such circumstances, SIEM platforms are undergoing a profound transformation from "auto-pilot" to "AI-pilot." By incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies, SIEM platforms have not only enhanced their threat detection and response capabilities but have also achieved a qualitative leap in data fusion and cross-domain collaboration. At the same time, the value proposition of SIEM platforms is transitioning from being merely a "cost center" to a "value center," becoming an important driver for enterprises to maximize their security value. This article will delve into the evolutionary path of SIEM platforms, technological innovations, and their significant value in enterprise security operations.</p>

            <h3>Limitations and Challenges of Traditional SIEM Platforms</h3>
            <p>Traditional SIEM platforms, based on predefined rules and pattern matching, while performing well in detecting known threats, are struggling to cope with the many challenges of the modern cybersecurity environment.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inability to Handle Unknown Threats</strong>: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and zero-day exploits pose significant challenges due to their stealthiness and complexity, making traditional SIEM platforms' detection abilities inadequate.</li>
                <li><strong>Insufficient Attack Chain Correlation</strong>: Modern attacks often involve multiple stages and various techniques. Traditional SIEM platforms lack the ability to correlate these complex attack chains, making it difficult to identify complete attack events.</li>
                <li><strong>Inadequate Massive Data Processing</strong>: The exponential growth of enterprise-generated security data results in inefficient processing and analysis by traditional SIEM platforms, leading to critical threats being drowned in a sea of alerts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, the "data silos" problem prevalent within enterprises further exacerbates the limitations of traditional SIEM platforms. Data from different departments or systems remains isolated and cannot be effectively shared or integrated, making it difficult for security teams to obtain a comprehensive view of the threat landscape and miss the best opportunities to respond to complex cross-domain attacks. While traditional SIEM systems addressed the issue of centralized log management, their design was primarily aimed at single-domain security events, making them ill-suited for the needs of multi-source heterogeneous data fusion and analysis.</p>

            <h3>Evolution of AI-Driven SIEM Platforms</h3>
            <p>To address the limitations of traditional SIEM platforms, modern SIEM platforms are incorporating AI and machine learning technologies to achieve the leap from "auto-pilot" to "AI-pilot." AI-driven SIEM platforms possess the following core capabilities:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Analysis</strong>: By learning normal system behavior patterns, AI can identify anomalous behaviors, even if they do not match any known rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Threat Intelligence Integration</strong>: AI-driven SIEM platforms can integrate threat intelligence from multiple sources in real-time, applying it to threat detection and response for a more comprehensive threat perception capability.</li>
                <li><strong>Attack Chain Analysis</strong>: AI can correlate different stages and components of an attack, identifying the complete attack chain to more effectively disrupt it.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Response</strong>: By automatically executing predefined response actions (such as isolating infected devices or blocking malicious traffic), AI-driven SIEM platforms can significantly reduce response times and minimize human errors.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The introduction of AI technology not only significantly enhances the threat detection capabilities of SIEM platforms but also significantly improves the efficiency of threat detection and response through automated processing and analysis of massive data. Additionally, AI reduces false positive rates, allowing security teams to focus on truly important threats, optimizing resource allocation and improving overall security operations efficiency.</p>

            <h3>From "Data Silos" to "Data Fusion": Building Cross-Domain Collaborative SIEM Solutions</h3>
            <p>Addressing the "data silos" issue is a core objective for modern SIEM platforms to achieve cross-domain collaboration. Data fusion integrates data from different sources and formats to form a unified security data view, enabling comprehensive threat perception and efficient security operations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Threat Perception</strong>: Data fusion correlates threat information from different levels, helping enterprises form a holistic threat perception capability.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Response and Automation</strong>: Through data fusion, SIEM systems can achieve unified scheduling and automated response for different security tools, significantly enhancing response speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Improving Security Operations Efficiency</strong>: Data fusion reduces the time security teams spend switching between multiple systems, helping them analyze and handle security incidents more efficiently.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Building cross-domain collaborative SIEM solutions requires comprehensive optimization from technical architecture, data management, and organizational collaboration. For example, establishing a unified data collection and standardization framework to integrate multi-source heterogeneous data; leveraging AI and machine learning technologies for deep analysis of fused data; and formulating cross-domain collaborative security strategies, defining the roles and collaboration mechanisms of various tools and systems.</p>

            <h3>Value Redefinition of SIEM Platforms: From "Cost Center" to "Value Center"</h3>
            <p>Traditionally, SIEM platforms have been considered "cost centers" in enterprises due to their high deployment and maintenance costs, complex configuration requirements, and difficulty in quantifying security value. However, with technological advancements and the escalating security needs of enterprises, the value proposition of SIEM platforms is undergoing a fundamental shift, gradually moving from a "cost center" to a "value center."</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Security Situation Awareness</strong>: SIEM platforms provide comprehensive cybersecurity situation awareness, helping enterprises understand their security status in real-time.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident Investigation and Traceability</strong>: SIEM platforms' collected log data provides essential evidence for security incident investigation, enabling the reconstruction of attack paths and identification of the attack source.</li>
                <li><strong>Improving Security Operations Efficiency</strong>: SIEM platforms significantly enhance security operations efficiency by automating repetitive tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantifying Security Value</strong>: By analyzing security incidents, risk assessments, and business impact assessments, SIEM platforms can quantify the value of security investments, providing decision-making support for management.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>To transition SIEM platforms from a "cost center" to a "value center," enterprises need to continuously invest in the following areas: clarifying security objectives, aligning SIEM platform construction with enterprise security strategies; forming professional security teams; and continuously optimizing SIEM platform configuration and strategies based on changes in the threat environment.</p>
