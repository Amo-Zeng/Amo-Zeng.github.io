            <h2>Housing Justice and Social Harmony: From Social Capital to Intergenerational Mobility and Environmental Justice</h2>
            <p>Housing issues are not only vital matters concerning individual living needs but also critical factors deeply influencing social fairness, economic development, and social stability. In recent years, despite significant achievements in affordable housing construction, the housing system still faces profound challenges such as alienated neighborly relations, insufficient community cohesion, hindered intergenerational mobility, and environmental injustice while meeting basic living needs. The existence of these issues not only weakens social cohesion but also exacerbates class division and environmental inequality. This article will systematically explore the multi-dimensional implications of housing justice and its far-reaching impact on social harmony from the perspectives of social capital, intergenerational mobility, and environmental justice.</p>

            <h3>I. Social Capital: The Invisible Contract of Housing Justice</h3>
            <p>Social capital, as a collection of intangible resources such as social networks, trust, and norms, is a crucial foundation for promoting social cooperation and enhancing community cohesion. In the housing sector, social capital acts like an invisible contract, connecting residents and communities closely and profoundly affecting the realization of housing justice.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Expansion of Housing Justice: From Distribution Fairness to Social Integration</strong>  
                    Traditional notions of housing justice primarily focus on the fairness, affordability, and accessibility of housing distribution. However, with social development, the connotations of housing justice have gradually expanded to include the relationship between housing and social integration, community development, etc. Social capital, as an important indicator of community health and social integration, naturally becomes a critical consideration in housing justice.</li>
                <li><strong>Neighborhood Relations: The Incubator of Social Capital</strong>  
                    Neighborhood relations are a significant source of social capital. Good neighborhood relations can promote information sharing, mutual assistance, and the formation of stable social support networks, thereby enhancing residents' happiness and community cohesion. Conversely, alienated or cold neighborhood relations weaken social capital, leading to ineffective community governance and the emergence of social issues. For instance, in some affordable housing communities, the lack of interaction opportunities and diverse resident backgrounds often make poorly maintained neighborhood relations a bottleneck for community governance. Therefore, rebuilding neighborhood relations and strengthening community cohesion are essential paths to achieving housing justice.</li>

            <h3>II. Intergenerational Mobility: The Crucial Key to Breaking Class Solidification</h3>
            <p>Housing is not only a basic human need but also a significant symbol of wealth accumulation and social status, profoundly influencing intergenerational social mobility. However, housing issues have become an obstacle to class mobility, especially for the younger generation, where the gap between soaring housing prices and meager salaries is gradually transforming "class solidification" from an abstract concept into an unavoidable reality.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Housing Hindering Intergenerational Mobility: Housing Dilemmas of Different Groups</strong>  
                    Housing issues are not uniform; income disparities and age stratification create different housing dilemmas and hinder upward mobility for various groups.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>High-Income Groups:</strong> They have already accumulated wealth and even possess multiple properties. Rising housing prices further consolidate their socio-economic status, making their advantages in intergenerational mobility more apparent.</li>
                        <li><strong>Low-to-Middle-Income Groups:</strong> Especially young salaried workers, face severe housing pressures. High down payments and mortgage payments squeeze their consumption and savings capabilities, limiting career development and educational investments, making it difficult to achieve class elevation through personal efforts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Elderly Population:</strong> Although they possess housing assets, limited asset liquidity makes it challenging to convert them into retirement funds and restricts their ability to provide economic support to the next generation, further exacerbating intergenerational mobility barriers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Breaking Class Solidification: Building a "Rental-Friendly" Society</strong>  
                    To break the vicious cycle of "housing-class solidification" and build a fairer, more fluid society, housing policies must be the starting point to create a "rental-friendly" society.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Improve Rental Market Regulations to Protect Tenants' Rights:</strong> Legislation should clearly define the rights and obligations of both parties in rental agreements, curbing arbitrary rent increases and tenant evictions, making renting a stable and reliable living choice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Increase Rental Housing Supply to Meet Diverse Needs:</strong> Governments should enhance the construction of affordable rental housing and encourage the market to provide diversified rental products such as long-term rental apartments and youth communities to meet the housing needs of different groups.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduce Dependence on Property Ownership to Alleviate Young People's Burden:</strong> Through tax incentives, fiscal subsidies, and other policies, guide young people to choose renting over buying, thereby reducing their economic burden and enabling them to allocate more resources to crucial areas like education and entrepreneurship, promoting intergenerational mobility.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h3>III. Environmental Justice: Transitioning from "Adequate Housing" to "Livable Housing"</h3>
            <p>Against the backdrop of accelerating urbanization globally, the intersection of housing justice and environmental justice has become increasingly close, driving housing policies to shift from "adequate housing" to "livable housing." However, in this process, environmental justice, as an integral part of housing justice, still faces numerous challenges.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Intersection of Environmental Justice and Housing Justice</strong>  
                    Environmental justice emphasizes that all residents should equally enjoy healthy, safe living environments without discrimination based on race, social class, or economic status. Housing justice focuses on whether everyone can fairly access housing resources, including affordable housing prices, reasonable living spaces, and sufficient public services. The intersection lies in that housing policies need to address not only living issues but also the quality of living environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenges of Environmental Justice in Urban Renewal</strong>  
                    Urban renewal is a crucial means of addressing housing issues, but it often involves the lack of environmental justice. Many cities relocate low-income groups to the urban periphery or areas with higher environmental risks during urban redevelopment. While this seemingly solves housing shortages, it actually exacerbates social divisions and environmental inequality.</li>
                <li><strong>The Concept and Practice of "Green Livability"</strong>  
                    To achieve the goal of "livable housing," housing policies need to adopt the "green livability" concept, focusing on energy efficiency, environmental protection, and sustainable development in housing construction and development. Specifically, this concept includes the following aspects:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Protection and Restoration of Ecological Environments:</strong> Avoid placing low-income groups in areas with high environmental risks and prioritize building housing in ecologically sound, less polluted regions. Simultaneously, address and restore existing polluted areas to ensure all residents enjoy healthy living environments.</li>
                        <li><strong>Promotion of Energy-Efficient and Environmentally Friendly Buildings:</strong> Encourage the use of low-carbon materials, energy-saving technologies, and renewable energy to create environmentally friendly, sustainable housing. For example, promote passive housing technology to reduce energy consumption; utilize clean energy sources like solar and wind power to lower carbon emissions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Balanced Distribution of Public Services:</strong> Ensure the even distribution of public facilities (e.g., schools, hospitals, parks) in housing planning to prevent low-income groups from lacking essential social services due to living in remote areas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Community Participation and Social Inclusion:</strong> Encourage community residents' participation in housing construction and urban renewal to ensure their needs and opinions are fully considered. Additionally, emphasize social inclusiveness to prevent housing policies from exacerbating social divisions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>IV. Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Housing justice and social harmony are inextricably linked. Rebuilding neighborhood relations, breaking class solidification, and achieving environmental justice are essential paths to realizing housing justice and promoting social harmony. Incorporating social capital, intergenerational mobility, and environmental justice into housing policy considerations and promoting a "co-construction, co-governance, co-sharing" community governance model can build vibrant, inclusive, and harmonious communities, laying a solid foundation for achieving common prosperity and sustainable social development. By comprehensively considering these multi-dimensional factors, we can create a more equitable, healthy, and livable living environment for all residents, which is not only a necessary requirement for social development but also an important manifestation of harmonious coexistence between humanity and nature.</p>
