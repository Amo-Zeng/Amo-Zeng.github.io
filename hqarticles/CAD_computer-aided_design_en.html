            <h3>Virtual Design Teams: A Convergence of Wisdom Across Time and Space</h3>
            <p>The emergence of virtual design teams has fundamentally revolutionized traditional design collaboration models. Leveraging cloud-based CAD platforms and real-time synchronization technology, designers, engineers, and clients from around the world can transcend geographical and time zone limitations to connect closely. Whether it's a multinational corporation's product development team or a distributed design studio, virtual design teams allow the convergence of global wisdom to collaboratively drive project progress.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-time Synchronization: A New Paradigm for Collaborative Design</strong>  
                    <p>Real-time synchronization technology transforms collaborative design from a "relay race" into "instant art." All team members can simultaneously access and edit the same design file, with the platform automatically recording each step, providing version control and historical records to ensure design accuracy and traceability. Communication among designers becomes more convenient and efficient, with instant messaging, voice, or video conferences resolving issues promptly and facilitating rapid design iterations.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Future Outlook: Challenges and Opportunities Coexist</strong>  
                    <p>Although virtual design teams have shown significant advantages, their development still faces challenges such as technical barriers, team collaboration, and cultural differences. However, with the continuous advancement of 5G, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality technologies, these issues will gradually be resolved. In the future, virtual design teams will not only be exclusive tools for large enterprises but also accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises and even individual designers, enabling them to integrate global design resources and create more competitive products and services.</p>

            <h3>From Geometry to Intelligence: The Deep Integration of AI and CAD</h3>
            <p>The rise of artificial intelligence has infused new vitality into CAD technology. The integration of AI is transforming CAD from a simple geometric modeling tool into an intelligent design assistant capable of autonomous learning and decision-making, ushering in a new era of design.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intelligent Interaction: From "Tool" to "Partner"</strong>  
                    <p>Traditional CAD systems are static tools, but with AI's involvement, they are evolving into dynamic design partners. Through intelligent sketch recognition, real-time optimization feedback, and intelligent search recommendations, AI can help designers more efficiently complete the entire process from concept to detailed design. Designers only need to input simple descriptions, and AI can automatically generate precise 3D models, even offering optimization suggestions. This conversational interaction model significantly enhances design efficiency and shortens the product development cycle.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Autonomous Learning and Generative Design: Breaking Traditional Design Boundaries</strong>  
                    <p>AI's autonomous learning capabilities are breaking through the limitations of traditional design methods. Parametric design and generative design based on machine learning can learn design rules from massive data and automatically generate solutions that meet design objectives. For example, AI can generate new architectural designs that align with specific styles based on historical data of architectural styles, or explore multiple design possibilities based on engineering constraints. Biomimetic design, by simulating biological structures in nature, creates more efficient and environmentally friendly design solutions.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>AI Empowering the Entire Process: Building an Intelligent Design Ecosystem</strong>  
                    <p>In the future, the integration of CAD and AI will span the entire product lifecycle. AI will not only provide support during the design phase but also play a significant role in manufacturing, analysis, and maintenance. Intelligent design collaboration can achieve seamless integration between different tools, while digital twin technology can simulate the real-time operational status of products and predict their future behavior. The integration of design and manufacturing will also be achieved through AI, automatically generating processing codes and optimizing process flows, promoting seamless integration from design to manufacturing.</p>

            <h3>Modular Design and Parametric-Driven: The Future of Customization</h3>
            <p>In an era of pursuing personalization and rapid iteration, modular design and parametric-driven approaches have become important directions for the development of CAD technology. Modular design decomposes complex products into independent functional modules, while parametric-driven customization responds to user needs by adjusting parameters, enabling mass customization.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Modular Design: The Foundation of Customization</strong>  
                    <p>The core of modular design lies in the combination of standardization and flexibility. By decomposing products into standardized functional modules, users can freely combine modules based on their needs to quickly generate personalized product solutions. This design model not only reduces production costs but also shortens the R&D cycle, improving the scalability, upgradability, and maintainability of products.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Parametric-Driven: The Core of Flexible Customization</strong>  
                    <p>Parametric design allows for flexible control of product shape, size, and function by adjusting parameter values. The integration of AI further enhances the intelligence level of parametric design, enabling automatic optimization of product performance, prediction of potential issues, and generation of diverse design solutions based on user needs. Parametric-driven customization allows designers to quickly respond to market changes and meet user's personalized demands.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>The Fusion of Modular and Parametric: A Customization Platform</strong>  
                    <p>The combination of modular design and parametric-driven approaches builds a powerful customization platform. Users can freely select module combinations, adjust parameters, and quickly generate product solutions that meet their needs.
