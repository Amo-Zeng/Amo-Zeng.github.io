            <h2>Evolution of CAD Technology</h2>
            <p>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) technology, born in the 1960s, has undergone multiple technological revolutions. From early 2D drawing tools to today's 3D modeling and simulation software, CAD technology has continuously advanced, capable of handling increasingly complex design tasks.

            <h2>Basic Concepts of Biomimicry Design</h2>
            <p>Biomimicry Design is a design method inspired by nature, aiming to draw inspiration from biological systems to solve engineering and design problems. Nature, through millions of years of evolution, has formed many efficient and sustainable structures and functions. For example, the microstructure of shark skin can reduce friction resistance, and the structure of insect wings can enhance flight efficiency. By studying these natural phenomena, designers can develop more efficient and eco-friendly artificial systems.</p>

            <h2>Integration of CAD and Biomimicry Design</h2>
            <h3>1. Structural Optimization</h3>
            <p>Biomimicry Design often involves complex geometric shapes and structures. CAD software provides powerful modeling and optimization tools, allowing designers to quickly create and optimize these complex structures. For example, by mimicking the structure of spider webs, designers can design high-strength, lightweight materials, and use CAD software for mechanical analysis and optimization.</p>
            <h3>2. Fluid Dynamics</h3>
            <p>In the aerospace and automotive industries, fluid dynamics design is crucial. Biomimicry Design provides many valuable inspirations, such as the drag reduction mechanism of shark skin. Through the fluid dynamics simulation functions of CAD software, designers can simulate and optimize these biomimetic structures, thereby improving the efficiency and performance of aircraft or cars.</p>
            <h3>3. Biomedical Engineering</h3>
            <p>Biomimicry Design also has broad applications in biomedical engineering. For example, by mimicking the structure of human joints, designers can design more comfortable and efficient artificial joints. CAD software provides precise modeling and analysis tools, enabling designers to simulate human motion and optimize the design of artificial joints.</p>
            <h3>4. Architectural Design</h3>
            <p>In architectural design, Biomimicry Design can provide many innovative solutions. For example, by mimicking honeycomb structures, designers can design high-strength, lightweight building materials. CAD software provides powerful Building Information Modeling (BIM) functions, allowing designers to conduct comprehensive architectural design and analysis.</p>

            <h2>Integration of CAD and Virtual Reality (VR)</h2>
            <h3>1. Enhancing Design Efficiency</h3>
            <p>CAD software allows designers to create and modify complex 3D models on the computer, while VR technology makes these models more intuitive and easier to understand. Through VR headsets and handheld controllers, designers can directly enter the virtual environment and interact with the models. This immersive experience not only enhances design efficiency but also reduces errors in the design process.</p>
            <h3>2. Improving Collaboration and Communication</h3>
            <p>In traditional design workflows, designers typically communicate design schemes with clients and colleagues through 2D drawings or static 3D models. However, this method often fails to fully convey the details and intent of the design. Through VR technology, clients and design teams can jointly view and discuss design schemes in the virtual environment, thereby better understanding each other's needs and ideas.</p>
            <h3>3. Enhancing Simulation and Testing Capabilities</h3>
            <p>The integration of CAD and VR also significantly enhances simulation and testing capabilities. Designers can simulate different usage scenarios and conditions in the virtual environment, testing the performance and reliability of products. This not only saves time and cost of actual manufacturing and testing but also helps identify and solve potential problems in the design stage.</p>

            <h2>Integration of CAD and Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
            <h3>1. Automated Design</h3>
            <p>AI can automatically generate preliminary design schemes by learning from a large amount of design data and rules. For example, in architectural design, AI can automatically generate building models that meet specifications based on user needs and environmental conditions. This not only enhances design efficiency but also provides designers with more creative space.</p>
            <h3>2. Optimized Design</h3>
            <p>AI can find the optimal design scheme through optimization algorithms. For example, in mechanical design, AI can analyze material properties, manufacturing processes, and other factors to optimize component design, thereby improving product performance and reducing costs. AI can also perform multi-objective optimization to find the best solution that balances various needs.</p>
            <h3>3. Virtual Simulation</h3>
            <p>AI can predict the performance and effects of design schemes through simulation and modeling. For example, in automotive design, AI can simulate the driving conditions of cars on different roads, evaluating their safety and comfort. This not only saves time and cost of actual testing but also enhances the accuracy of the design.</p>
            <h3>4. Intelligent Manufacturing</h3>
            <p>AI can be integrated with CAD software to achieve intelligent manufacturing. For example, in 3D printing, AI can analyze data from the printing process, adjusting printing parameters to improve printing quality and efficiency. AI can also be integrated with robots to achieve automated production, enhancing manufacturing efficiency and flexibility.</p>
