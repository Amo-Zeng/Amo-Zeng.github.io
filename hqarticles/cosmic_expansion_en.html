            <h3>I. Information Entropy and the Future Destiny of the Universe</h3>
            <h4>1.1 Information Entropy and Cosmic Entropy Increase: Evolution from Order to Chaos</h4>
            <p>Information entropy, as a measure of system information and disorder, is closely related to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. According to this law, the entropy of a closed system always tends to increase, meaning the system's disorder will continually enhance. Cosmic expansion can be considered a gigantic closed system, where the expansion process leads to continuous spatial enlargement and the thinning of matter distribution. This spatial expansion increases the number of microscopic states in the system, thereby increasing information entropy.</p>
            <p>As the universe expands, matter gradually disperses into larger spaces, reducing the density of matter per unit volume and increasing the system's state diversity, leading to higher information entropy. This process is not merely a geometric change in space but also an entropy-increasing process, resulting in increased overall disorder in the system. Cosmic expansion is essentially an evolution from order to disorder, affecting not only the distribution of matter but also profoundly changing the way information is transmitted.</p>
            <h4>1.2 The Limits of Information Transmission and Cosmic Isolation: From Interconnectedness to Islands</h4>
            <p>Cosmic expansion not only alters the distribution of matter but also affects information transmission. As the distance between galaxies increases, the propagation time of light and other information carriers lengthens. The redshift effect stretches the wavelength of light, reducing its energy, eventually making photons too low in energy to be detected. This difficulty in information transmission will lead to information isolation between different regions of the universe, further increasing its entropy.</p>
            <p>Information isolation means reduced interactions between different regions, increasing the overall disorder in the system and further raising information entropy. In the distant future, galaxies may completely lose contact, making information transmission impossible, and the universe will enter an isolated state. This isolation is not only physical separation but also the end of information and energy exchange, turning the universe from an interconnected whole into isolated "information islands."</p>
            <h4>1.3 The Future of the Universe: Heat Death, Cold Death, and the Ultimate Fate of Information</h4>
            <p>The traditional heat death theory posits that the universe's ultimate fate is all energy evenly distributed, reaching maximum entropy, making any useful work impossible. However, from the perspective of information entropy, cosmic expansion may lead to another "cold death" scenario: the universe will become incredibly cold and dark, with all information and energy diluted to unobservable and unusable levels.</p>
            <p>Whether heat death or cold death, the universe's future destiny is closely related to the evolution of information entropy. Cosmic expansion is not just a geometric change in space but a profound transformation in the distribution and transmission of information and energy. The future universe may be a world filled with disorder and information dilution, but this does not mean the end of life but potentially opens a new mode of cosmic evolution. In this mode, information may no longer exist in traditional forms but in a more hidden and complex state, continuing to influence the evolution of the universe.</p>

            <h3>II. Quantum Gravity and the Nature of Dark Energy</h3>
            <h4>2.1 Quantum Nature of Spacetime: From Smooth Continuity to Foam-like</h4>
            <p>In classical physics, spacetime is viewed as a smooth, continuous four-dimensional manifold, where general relativity successfully describes how matter bends spacetime and how bent spacetime affects matter's motion. However, quantum mechanics tells us that all matter and energy have wave properties, meaning spacetime itself cannot be perfectly smooth and continuous at microscopic scales.</p>
            <p>Quantum gravity theories, such as string theory and loop quantum gravity, propose that spacetime at the Planck scale (about 10^-35 meters) exhibits a "foam-like" structure known as "spacetime foam" or "quantum foam." These foams continuously generate, annihilate, and interact, forming the basic structure of spacetime. This intense quantum fluctuation disrupts the continuity and smoothness of classical spacetime, making it chaotic and uncertain at microscopic scales.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Quantum Origin of Dark Energy: From Vacuum Fluctuations to Spacetime Expansion</h4>
            <p>Dark energy, which accounts for about 68% of the universe's total energy, is considered the primary driver of the universe's accelerated expansion. Traditional cosmological models view dark energy as a uniformly distributed energy field in space with negative pressure, pushing the universe to expand. However, this explanation remains within the framework of classical physics, not touching the essence of dark energy.</p>
            <p>From the perspective of quantum gravity, dark energy may be closely related to vacuum energy. The vacuum is not "empty" but filled with quantum fluctuations of various virtual particles. According to quantum field theory, energy fluctuations constantly occur even in a vacuum. The energy from these fluctuations may be the source of dark energy, driving spacetime expansion.</p>
            <p>Quantum gravity theory provides new insights into solving this problem. In the context of spacetime foam, vacuum energy may not be a fixed constant but closely related to quantum fluctuations in spacetime. The constantly changing spacetime bubbles in spacetime foam may lead to continuous changes in vacuum energy, affecting the expression of dark energy.</p>
            <h4>2.3 Quantum Origin of Cosmic Expansion: From Microscopic Fluctuations to Macroscopic Expansion</h4>
            <p>Cosmic expansion is not just a macroscopic phenomenon; it may also be rooted in spacetime's quantum nature. The dynamic properties of spacetime foam may lead to a process similar to "quantum tunneling," causing the entire universe to expand from a smaller state to a larger one.</p>
            <p>In the framework of quantum gravity, cosmic expansion may not be driven by a uniform dark energy field but by quantum fluctuations and interactions in spacetime foam. These fluctuations and interactions may drive overall spacetime expansion, also explaining why the expansion shows an accelerating trend.</p>

            <h3>III. Cosmic Expansion from a Biological Perspective: Changes in the Habitable Zone and the Future of Intelligent Life</h3>
            <h4>3.1 Changes in the Habitable Zone and the Vulnerability of Life</h4>
            <p>"Habitable Zone" refers to the region around a star where surface conditions allow liquid water to exist. Liquid water is essential for the origin and evolution of life. However, continuous cosmic expansion will inevitably lead to changes in the habitable zone.</p>
            <p>As the universe expands, the light from galaxies redshifts, meaning its wavelength lengthens and frequency decreases. For stars, the redshift effect causes their radiation energy to shift toward the low-frequency end (red end), reducing temperature and ultimately leading to a shift of the habitable zone outward. Additionally, gravitational waves generated by cosmic expansion will affect the structure and evolution of galaxies, potentially pushing planets that were once in the habitable zone out or allowing regions previously unsuitable for life to enter the habitable zone.</p>
            <h4>3.2 Future of Intelligent Life: Challenges and Opportunities</h4>
            <p>Cosmic expansion not only affects the universe's overall destiny but may also profoundly impact the future of intelligent life. As the universe expands, the distance between galaxies increases, and intelligent life may face the following challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Difficulty in Information Transmission</strong>: As the distance between galaxies increases, the propagation time of light and other information carriers will be infinitely prolonged, making information exchange between intelligent life increasingly difficult, possibly even completely interrupted.</li>
                <li><strong>Cosmic Isolation</strong>: Cosmic expansion may cause the galaxy inhabited by intelligent life to lose contact with other galaxies, forming an isolated cosmic system. This isolation will limit the evolution and external cognition of intelligent life.</li>
                <li><strong>Information Forgetting and Self-awareness</strong>: As the universe expands, information accumulated by intelligent life may gradually be forgotten, increasing the system's disorder. This may change intelligent life's self-awareness and understanding of the universe, possibly prompting a rethinking of the meaning of life and the essence of the universe.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, cosmic expansion also provides opportunities for intelligent life:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Space Exploration and Colonization</strong>: Cosmic expansion provides vast living space for intelligent life. By exploring and colonizing new habitable zones, intelligent life can expand its survival boundaries, avoiding risks posed by changes in a single habitable zone.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Breakthroughs and Civilization Leap</strong>: Challenges posed by cosmic expansion will drive intelligent life to continuously break through technological bottlenecks, developing advanced energy, material, information, and biological technologies, achieving leapfrog development of civilization.</li>
                <li><strong>Cosmic Ethics and Philosophical Thought</strong>: Cosmic expansion compels intelligent life to think about its place and meaning in the vast universe, developing a new cosmic ethics and philosophical thought, guiding civilization toward a brighter future.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Cosmic expansion is a complex and profound issue, offering new insights from information entropy, quantum gravity, to biology. The increase in information entropy suggests that the universe's future may be a world filled with disorder and information dilution, while quantum gravity theory provides new explanations for the nature of dark energy. Meanwhile, the biological perspective reminds us that cosmic expansion not only affects the physical evolution of the universe but also concerns the fragility and resilience of life and the opportunities and challenges of civilization.</p>
            <p>The future universe may be a world full of unknowns and challenges, but intelligent life has the ability to write its own legend in the vast universe through technological breakthroughs and philosophical thinking. Cosmic expansion is not just an expansion of space but a profound transformation of information, energy, and life, continuing to inspire our endless exploration of the essence of the universe.</p>
