            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In recent years, as global urbanization accelerates, finding a balance between economic development and environmental protection has become a focal point for governments and academia worldwide. Urbanization has driven economic growth and improved living standards on one hand, while also causing severe environmental issues like air pollution, water scarcity, and loss of biodiversity on the other. This article aims to discuss strategies for environmental protection in the urbanization process, supported by relevant data and examples, arguing that urbanization and environmental protection are not irreconcilable conflicts.</p>

            <h3>Impact of Urbanization on the Environment</h3>
            <h4>Air Pollution</h4>
            <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2019, 90% of the global population lived in areas where air quality did not meet WHO guidelines. Urbanization leads to increased use of vehicles and industrial activities, directly emitting large amounts of pollutants like PM2.5, NOx, and SO2. For instance, Beijing's smog problem peaked in 2013, with an annual PM2.5 concentration reaching 89.5 micrograms per cubic meter, far exceeding WHO's recommended value (10 micrograms per cubic meter).</p>
            <h4>Water Scarcity</h4>
            <p>Urbanization results in the overuse and pollution of water resources. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) reports that water consumption in urban areas is twice the rate of renewable water supply. For example, in Mexico City, annual water extraction exceeds its replenishment, causing a continuous drop in groundwater levels.</p>

            <h3>Strategies for Balancing Urbanization and Environmental Protection</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Green Building:</strong> Promoting green building standards, like LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification, can significantly reduce the environmental impact of buildings. Since the launch of Singapore's Green Building initiative in 2005, over 2000 buildings have received green certification, with energy and water consumption 30% to 50% lower than traditional buildings.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Transportation Systems:</strong> Developing efficient public transportation systems can reduce private car usage, thereby lowering urban carbon emissions. For example, London's congestion charge policy, implemented since 2003, has reduced traffic by about 20%, correspondingly reducing air pollution.</li>
                <li><strong>Urban Greening:</strong> Increasing urban greenery not only improves air quality but also enhances biodiversity. The creation and maintenance of Central Park in New York is a successful example, serving not only as a recreational space but also regulating the city's microclimate.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The conflict between urbanization and environmental protection is not insurmountable. Through scientific planning, technological innovation, and policy guidance, both can be harmoniously developed. Data and examples show that the key to achieving this balance lies in the rational use of resources, promoting sustainable development concepts, and technologies. Future urbanization should focus more on environmentally friendly development models to ensure that economic growth and environmental protection go hand in hand.</p>
