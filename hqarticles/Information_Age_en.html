        </section>

        <section>
            <p>While the world celebrates AlphaFold's breakthrough in solving the protein folding puzzle, a silent philosophical question is being overlooked: <span class="highlight">**Are we redefining "life" through algorithms?**</span></p>
            <p>When AI predicts the 3D structure of amino acid chains with 0.1-angstrom precision, it never understands *why* life needs structure—it only sees a "data input-output" flow. <br>
            It calculates folding pathways but doesn't grasp *why* folding occurs; it simulates hydrogen bond networks but doesn't comprehend *why* stability matters; it outputs a "correct" conformation but remains utterly silent on *why life exists at all*. <br>
            This is not technical imperfection, but rather <span class="highlight">**an ontological overreach**</span>: algorithms no longer serve as tools to reveal the world, but have begun to <span class="highlight">**decide what may exist and what must be excluded**</span>. <br>
            This marks the deepest alienation of the information age: <strong>technology is no longer merely a tool for revealing the world, but has become an ontological framework defining "what may be."</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Tyranny of Computability: The Flattening of Being</h2>
            <p>In *The Question Concerning Technology*, Heidegger introduced the concept of *Ge-stell* (enframing)—modern technology is not a neutral means, but a <span class="highlight">**compulsory mode of revealing**</span> that "orders" the world into calculable, controllable, and schedulable "standing-reserve" (Bestand). <br>
            In the industrial age, nature was ordered into "energy"; today, <strong>human beings themselves are ordered into "data points."</strong></p>

            <p>Take <strong>recommendation systems</strong> as an example: you open a short-video platform, and AI constructs a "user profile" based on your swipe speed, dwell time, and like frequency. <br>
            This "you" is your "being" as perceived by the algorithm—a dynamic model composed of behavioral trajectories, preference labels, and emotional fluctuations. <br>
            But what about the you who stays up late, scrolling through childhood photos? The you who cries at an old song but never likes it? The you who writes in the comments, "I don't know why, but this made me cry"? <br>
            <span class="highlight">**These unmarkable, unpredictable moments are treated by the system as "noise"—not a lack of authenticity, but a lack of computability.**</span></p>

            <p>Even more extreme, in <strong>social credit systems</strong>, a person's "being" is further compressed into a function of "behavioral compliance." <br>
            You wear a helmet while riding an e-bike: +1 point. You evade subway fare: -5 points. You volunteer in your community: +10 points. <br>
            Your "freedom" is defined as "staying within boundaries," your "morality" quantified as "point gains/losses," and your "sociality" simplified into "network node weight." <br>
            This is not governance—this is <span class="highlight">**ontological reconstruction**</span>: you "exist" because you "can be scored."</p>

            <p class="philosophy-quote">
                Heidegger once warned: "Science de-worlds nature, turning it into mathematical nature."<br>
                Today, algorithms <span class="highlight">**de-humanize**</span> people, turning them into <span class="highlight">**datafied individuals**</span>.<br>
                When a depressed patient is diagnosed as "abnormal emotional fluctuation frequency + reduced social interaction," their suffering becomes an "intervenable behavioral pattern";<br>
                When an artist's creation is assessed as "style similarity + dissemination heat," their inspiration becomes "content tags";<br>
                When a philosopher's contemplation is judged by the system as "no interaction, low dissemination, no conversion," their thought is labeled "ineffective content"—<br>
                <strong>Being is being flattened by algorithms into computable surfaces, while depth, silence, and uncertainty are systematically excluded from "reality."</strong>
            </p>

            <p>This is <span class="highlight">**the tyranny of computability**</span>: not violence, but <span class="highlight">**a gentle, efficient, self-justifying exclusion mechanism**</span>. <br>
            It doesn't stop you from thinking, but makes your thinking "invisible"; it doesn't deprive you of emotion, but makes your emotion "unrecorded"; <br>
            it doesn't deny your existence, but makes you "insufficiently datafied to exist."</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Incalculable Human Experience: Marginalization in the Algorithmic World</h2>
            <p>Yet some experiences, like ghosts, linger beyond algorithmic boundaries—unmodelable, unoptimizable, unfit for "efficiency maximization."</p>

            <h3>Love</h3>
            <p>When AI labels a couple's conversation as "positive emotion + high interaction frequency," it cannot comprehend why love requires misunderstanding, silence, sacrifice, and waiting. <br>
            Love is not "emotional stability," nor "smooth communication," nor "frequent interaction"—love is <span class="highlight">**choosing to approach despite misunderstanding, feeling connected in silence, finding freedom in sacrifice**</span>. <br>
            Algorithms may predict "breakup probability," but cannot understand "why someone would choose to love despite knowing it will hurt."</p>

            <h3>Death</h3>
            <p>When medical AI predicts a patient's survival probability, it cannot confront "death" as the ultimate boundary of life's meaning. <br>
            Death is not "declining survival rate," nor "organ failure," nor "treatment failure"—death is <span class="highlight">**the manifestation of existential finitude, the awakening of "being-toward-death"**</span>. <br>
            <span class="philosophy-quote">
                Heidegger said: "Only by facing death can one authentically exist."<br>
                But algorithms "de-ontologize" death: they care only about "how much longer you can live," not "why you should live at all."
            </span></p>

            <h3>Freedom</h3>
            <p>When navigation algorithms "optimize" your route, they never consider "getting lost" as a metaphor for freedom. <br>
            Freedom is not "shortest path," nor "maximum efficiency," nor "zero delay"—freedom is <span class="highlight">**choosing amid uncertainty, growing through error, creating meaning in meaninglessness**</span>. <br>
            Algorithms pursue the "optimal solution"; humans need "possible worlds."</p>

            <p>These experiences constitute what Heidegger called "<strong>authentic being</strong>" (Eigentlichkeit)—the human capacity to face finitude and choose possibilities beyond technological disclosure. <br>
            But in the algorithmic ontology, they are systematically <span class="highlight">**marginalized, stigmatized, even pathologized**</span>. <br>
            "High emotional fluctuation"?—requires psychological intervention. "Unpredictable behavior"?—requires behavioral correction. "Unproductive thinking"?—requires cognitive training. <br>
            <span class="highlight">**Incomputability has become synonymous with "abnormality."**</span></p>

            <p>This is the algorithmic world's "<span class="highlight">**ontological violence**</span>": it doesn't kill, but makes you <span class="highlight">**cease to exist as a human being**</span>.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Pathways of Resistance: Rethinking Technological Rationality</h2>
            <p>How to resist the colonization by algorithmic ontology? <br>
            Heidegger's answer is "<strong>thinking</strong>" (Denken)—a meditative mode distinct from technological rationality that guards the "truth of being." <br>
            In the information age, this requires us to:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reclaim the "incalculable" domain</strong><br>
                    In education, preserve "no standard answer" spaces for contemplation—philosophy, art, and writing classes that emphasize <span class="highlight">uncertainty, ambiguity, openness</span>.<br>
                    In healthcare, defend "unquantifiable" doctor-patient empathy—e.g., "empathy index" should not replace "eye contact," nor "diagnostic accuracy" replace "holding a patient's hand."<br>
                    In urban design, preserve "useless spaces"—parks, benches, street graffiti—to make "purposelessness" possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Develop "anti-algorithmic" technologies</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cognitive whitespace</strong>: Design non-recommending bookshelves, untagged note systems, and algorithm-free social platforms to allow "serendipity."</li>
                        <li><strong>Unpredictable interaction</strong>: Random games, open-ended AI dialogues, "loss-of-control" mechanisms in generative art—to make technology <span class="highlight">acknowledge its own limits</span>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Slow Data movement</strong>: Advocate for "slow data" emphasizing <span class="highlight">depth, context, and temporality</span> over "real-time, high-frequency, massive" data.<br>
                            E.g., using one year of diary data instead of one second of clickstreams to understand a person.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Philosophical intervention: Teach AI to "learn silence"</strong><br>
                    Inject phenomenology, existentialism, and hermeneutics into AI ethics, requiring algorithmic systems to <span class="highlight">recognize the legitimacy of the incalculable</span>.<br>
                    For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>In medical AI, introduce "<strong>existential prompts</strong>": When predicting death, display: "This model cannot understand the meaning of death. Please consult doctors, family, or faith."</li>
                        <li>In recommendation systems, implement "<strong>anti-recommendation</strong>": When users consume homogeneous content, proactively suggest "things you've never considered," breaking the "information cocoon" fate.</li>
                        <li>In AI design, include a "<strong>Heidegger module</strong>": At critical decisions, ask: "Does this reduce humans to standing-reserve? Does it obscure the depth of being?"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="philosophy-quote">
                As Heidegger said: "<strong>The essence of technology is nothing technological.</strong>"<br>
                True wisdom lies not in "knowing everything," but in <span class="highlight">**knowing that some things can never be known**</span>.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Becoming "Human" Again in the Algorithmic Age</h2>
            <div class="conclusion">
                <p>The deepest paradox of information civilization is this: <br>
                We've created unprecedented computational power, yet may be losing the ability to "understand the incalculable." <br>
                When AlphaFold deciphers protein structures, it reminds us: <br>
                <span class="highlight">**True wisdom does not lie in "knowing everything," but in knowing "some things can never be known"**</span>.</p>
                <p>In the mirror of algorithms, we must see not only the reflected "computability," <br>
                but also <span class="highlight">**beyond the frame**</span>—<br>
                that uncolonized domain of human "being": <br>
                <strong>silence, pain, love, death, freedom, chance, meaninglessness, the ineffable</strong>.</p>
                <p>These are the <span class="highlight">**ontological foundations**</span> of what it means to be human.</p>
                <p>We need not reject algorithms, but we must <span class="highlight">**refuse algorithms as the only light**</span>. <br>
                In the data deluge, let us relearn to <span class="highlight">**gaze into the abyss without being swallowed**</span>, <br>
                in a world obsessed with efficiency, let us relearn to <span class="highlight">**find existential weight in useless moments**</span>.</p>
                <p><strong>For humans are not data, but being. <br>
                And being will always exceed computability.</strong></p>
                <blockquote>
                    "The essence of technology is to make us rethink: who are we, why are we here, how do we exist?"<br>
                    —This is the deepest resistance of the algorithmic age.
                </blockquote>
