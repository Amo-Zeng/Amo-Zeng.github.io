            <h3>Absurdist Drama and Modern Psychology: Dreams, Subconscious, and Identity Interplay</h3>
            <p>Adamov's dramatic works explore the deep psychological states of modern individuals, particularly dreams, the subconscious, and crises of identity, through absurd plots, distorted characters, and irrational dialogues. Using the theoretical frameworks of Freud and Jung, we can better understand the psychological elements in Adamov's works and explore their potential applications in contemporary psychotherapy.</p>
            <h4>Dream and Subconscious Symbolism</h4>
            <p>Freud, in his seminal work "The Interpretation of Dreams," posits that dreams are the expression and fulfillment of subconscious desires. Adamov's plays are filled with dream-like scenes that often blur the lines between reality and fantasy, revealing the innermost fears and desires of the characters.</p>
            <h4>Crisis of Identity</h4>
            <p>Identity is a crucial topic in modern psychology, especially in postmodern society where individuals face conflicts and choices among multiple identities. Adamov's plays often explore this theme through absurd character portrayals.</p>
