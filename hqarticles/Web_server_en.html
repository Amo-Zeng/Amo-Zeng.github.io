            <h2>Chapter 1: Technological Paradigm Shift — From Static Hosting to Programmable Runtimes</h2>
            <p>For a long time, traditional web servers have played the role of "content distributors," with core functionalities limited to static resource hosting and simple script execution. However, with the maturation of cloud computing, edge computing, and Serverless architectures, web servers are undergoing a <strong>paradigm shift</strong>: evolving from passive responders to <strong>programmable runtimes (Programmable Runtime)</strong>. The key driver of this transformation is <strong>WebAssembly (Wasm)</strong> and lightweight runtimes such as Deno Deploy, Cloudflare Workers, and Fastly Compute@Edge. These enable function-level deployment with cross-language support, sandboxed bytecode execution, and millisecond-level cold starts. Developers no longer deploy entire services but instead atomize business logic into "edge functions" that execute dynamically at the closest node to users. This model of "logic close to users, executed on demand" not only reduces latency to single-digit milliseconds but also realizes a <strong>deploy-as-a-service (Deploy-as-a-Service)</strong> development experience. More importantly, the evolution of the WASI standard is gradually enabling Wasm to access system resources such as file systems and networks, transforming web servers into a globally distributed programmable logic network — <strong>servers are no longer "hosts," but "runtimes."</strong></p>

            <p class="transition">Yet, as logic becomes dynamic and ubiquitous, security boundaries blur. While programmability brings flexibility, it also expands the attack surface of the runtime — naturally leading to the next phase of transformation: how to ensure trustworthiness in dynamic execution?</p>

            <h2>Chapter 2: Security Architecture Revolution — From Network Protection to Trusted Execution Environments</h2>
            <p>Traditional security models rely on perimeter defenses (WAF, firewalls) and identity authentication (OAuth, zero trust), but they fail to address the critical issue of <strong>data exposure in memory during runtime</strong>. Confidential Computing emerges as a fundamental solution: leveraging hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX, AMD SEV, and ARM CCA, it creates encrypted, isolated "enclaves" (Enclaves) that ensure sensitive code and data are always processed in encrypted form in memory — even the operating system cannot access them. Combined with <strong>remote attestation (Remote Attestation)</strong>, clients can verify whether the server's runtime environment is trustworthy, achieving "end-to-end trust." Web servers thus evolve into <strong>trusted logic execution platforms</strong>, enabling "data usable but not visible" in high-sensitivity scenarios such as financial transactions, medical data sharing, and AI model inference. For example, deploying an SGX-based server at the edge allows biometric data to be compared within the enclave, with encrypted results returned — no plaintext is ever exposed. This not only complies with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA but also redefines the very meaning of "security" — <strong>from "preventing intrusions" to "preventing eavesdropping."</strong></p>

            <p class="transition">When a server can run arbitrary logic while maintaining hardware-level trust, it becomes more than just a service provider — it becomes an arbiter of identity and permissions. This is precisely the "trusted first hop" that the decentralized identity (DID) ecosystem urgently needs.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 3: Ecosystem Transformation — From Content Distributor to DID Entry Node</h2>
            <p>In the era of Web3 and user-owned data, web servers are becoming <strong>entry nodes for decentralized identity (DID)</strong>. Based on W3C DID standards and verifiable credentials (VCs), users control their identity via private keys, while VCs — digital "passports" issued by trusted authorities and held by users — enable portable, self-sovereign identity. Within this ecosystem, web servers play three key roles: <strong>DID resolution nodes</strong> (retrieving public keys via DID documents), <strong>VC verifiers</strong> (using zero-knowledge proofs or digital signatures), and <strong>authorization policy engines</strong> (dynamically granting access based on VC content). For instance, when a user logs into a government platform, the server verifies their DID-linked "real-name verification" VC and selectively reveals "age ≥ 18" without requiring an ID submission. Compared to the centralized trust model of OAuth 2.0, DID + VC enables <strong>mathematically verifiable identity control</strong>, supporting cross-platform interoperability, minimal data disclosure, and censorship resistance. Web servers thus evolve from "content distributors" into <strong>gatekeepers of user sovereignty</strong>, becoming indispensable "trusted entry points" in the Web3 ecosystem.</p>

            <h2>Future Outlook: The Next-Generation Web Server — A Triad of Trust, Programmability, and Identity</h2>
            <p>These three transformations are accelerating convergence, giving rise to <strong>next-generation trusted, programmable edge nodes</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Programmable Runtime × Confidential Computing</strong>: Edge Wasm functions embedded with TEE enclaves unify low latency and high security. For example, recommendation algorithms run in Wasm, while user profiling is processed within SGX.</li>
                <li><strong>Confidential Computing × DID</strong>: DID resolution and VC verification executed within TEEs prevent identity forgery and man-in-the-middle attacks, building a "trusted identity layer."</li>
                <li><strong>DID × Programmable Runtime</strong>: After logging in via DID, servers dynamically deploy personalized logic (e.g., customized AI services), enabling "identity-driven computation orchestration."</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In the future, web servers will no longer be a single technical component but <strong>the foundation of digital trust</strong>:<br>
                - For developers: a <strong>globally distributed programmable logic network</strong>;<br>
                - For users: the <strong>central hub for identity sovereignty and data control</strong>;<br>
                - For the ecosystem: a <strong>trusted gateway bridging Web2 and Web3</strong>.</p>
            <blockquote>
                This marks a deep paradigm shift in digital infrastructure — from "connecting everything" to "trusting everything." Web servers are becoming the <strong>foundation of a trusted digital society</strong>.
