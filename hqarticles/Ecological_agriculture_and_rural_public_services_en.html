            <h3>I. Ecological Agriculture: The "Green Engine" for Rural Public Service Transformation</h3>
            <p>As a sustainable agricultural development model, ecological agriculture not only injects new vitality into the rural economy but also provides a powerful impetus for the transformation and upgrading of rural public services. Its core concept is to achieve coordinated development between agricultural production and ecological protection through the recycling of resources and the restoration of ecosystems. In this process, the rural public service system is also reshaped, forming a more sustainable and diversified supply model.</p>
            <h4>1. Ecological Agriculture Drives Resource Integration and Efficiency Improvement in Public Services</h4>
            <p>The issues of resource waste and environmental pollution in traditional agricultural models have long constrained the efficiency of rural public service provision. Ecological agriculture, by reducing the use of fertilizers and pesticides and promoting organic fertilizers and biological control technologies, not only lowers production costs but also enhances the added value of agricultural products. The increase in farmers' income provides more financial support for public services and creates conditions for attracting social capital to participate in rural construction. Additionally, the development of ecological agriculture requires the joint participation of government, enterprises, and farmers, providing a new pathway for diversified public service provision.</p>
            <h4>2. Ecological Agriculture Reshapes Rural Values, Enhancing the Sustainability of Public Services</h4>
            <p>Ecological agriculture emphasizes the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature, transforming rural areas from a single "production base" into a multifunctional "living community." This value reshaping not only enhances the ecological attractiveness of rural areas but also injects new vitality into the内涵 of public services. For example, the development of ecological agriculture drives the rise of new businesses such as rural tourism and leisure agriculture, further enriching the supply of rural public services. Meanwhile, the improvement of the rural environment also provides a good foundation for the enhancement of public services such as education, medical care, and culture.</p>
            <h4>3. Ecological Agriculture Builds a Community of Interests, Promoting Diversified Public Service Provision</h4>
            <p>The development of ecological agriculture requires the joint participation of multiple stakeholders, providing an opportunity to build a "community of interests." Government, businesses, and farmers achieve collaborative development through a shared-interest mechanism, with enterprises providing technical support and market channels, farmers gaining higher economic returns, and enjoying better public services. This diversified supply model not only enhances the efficiency of public services but also strengthens their sustainability.</p>

            <h3>II. Rural Public Services: The "Key Support" for Ecological Agriculture</h3>
            <p>Rural public services are an important support for the development of ecological agriculture, providing resource integration, technical promotion, and infrastructure guarantees that lay a solid foundation for its sustainable development.</p>
            <h4>1. Resource Integration: Building the Material Basis for Ecological Recycling</h4>
            <p>Rural public services integrate resources from agriculture, living, and ecology to build an ecological recycling industrial chain that covers waste recycling, clean energy development, and eco-product value transformation. For example, the construction of rural waste treatment facilities and organic fertilizer plants converts crop straws, livestock manure, and other wastes into organic fertilizers and clean energy, realizing resource recycling and providing a stable material foundation for the development of ecological agriculture.</p>
            <h4>2. Technical Promotion: Empowering the Sustainable Development of Ecological Agriculture</h4>
            <p>Rural public services promote ecological agriculture and waste recycling technologies to farmers through a technical promotion system, enhancing their ecological awareness and production skills. For instance, the promotion of precision agriculture allows farmers to use fertilizers and pesticides more scientifically, reducing negative environmental impacts. Additionally, the application of information technology in rural public services provides digital support for the production, distribution, and consumption of ecological agriculture.</p>
            <h4>3. Infrastructure Guarantee: Bridging the "Last Mile" of Ecological Recycling</h4>
            <p>The improvement of rural infrastructure is crucial for the development of ecological agriculture. For example, the construction of biogas plants and waste treatment facilities provides hardware support for waste recycling, bridging the "last mile" of ecological recycling. This not only improves the living environment in rural areas but also creates favorable external conditions for the sustainable development of ecological agriculture.</p>

            <h3>III. Synergistic Evolution: Building a New Framework for Rural Governance</h3>
            <p>The synergistic evolution of ecological agriculture and rural public services is not just the integration of industries and services but also the reshaping of rural governance. This process, through the collaboration of policy guidance, market mechanisms, technological support, and community participation, builds a win-win "community of interests" for multiple stakeholders.</p>
            <h4>1. Policy Guidance: Building a Framework for Collaborative Development</h4>
            <p>The government plays a leading role in this collaborative process. By introducing policies supporting the integration of ecological agriculture and public services, the government not only provides financial and technical support for ecological agriculture but also promotes the diversified supply of rural public services. For example, through fiscal subsidies and tax incentives, the government encourages enterprises to participate in the construction and operation of rural public services, forming a良性互动 between the government and the market.</p>
            <h4>2. Market Mechanisms: Activating the Endogenous Motivation for Collaborative Development</h4>
            <p>The introduction of market mechanisms provides an endogenous driving force for the collaborative development of ecological agriculture and public services. By establishing a market-oriented mechanism for ecological agricultural products, enterprises can obtain economic returns by participating in ecological agriculture projects and use part of the profits to support the construction of rural public service facilities. This shared-interest mechanism not only enhances the efficiency of public service provision but also strengthens the market competitiveness of ecological agriculture.</p>
            <h4>3. Technological Innovation: Enhancing the Technological Support for Collaborative Development</h4>
            <p>Technological innovation is a key driver of collaborative development. By introducing advanced technologies such as precision agriculture and smart agriculture, the production efficiency and product quality of ecological agriculture are significantly improved. Meanwhile, the application of information technology in rural public services supports the intelligent management of public services, enhancing their efficiency and precision.</p>
            <h4>4. Community Participation: Strengthening the Grassroots Foundation for Collaborative Development</h4>
            <p>Farmers are the main participants in the development of ecological agriculture and the primary beneficiaries of public services. By strengthening the organization and education of farmers, they can better engage in the production of ecological agriculture and play a greater role in the provision of public services. For example, by establishing "village regulations," villagers can voluntarily participate in the collaborative development of ecological agriculture and public services, creating a favorable social atmosphere.</p>
