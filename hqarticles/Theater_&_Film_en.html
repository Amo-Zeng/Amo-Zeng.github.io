            <h2>The Future of Theatre and Film: The Interplay of Body, Technology, and Culture</h2>
            <p>Theatre and film, as two classical narrative art forms, have demonstrated distinct differences in their performance techniques and media characteristics since their inception. Theatre relies on the physical expressiveness of actors, emphasizing the audience's "presence"; film, on the other hand, depends on precise technical control, focusing on the audience's "immediacy." However, with the rapid development of digital technology, the boundaries between these two arts are becoming increasingly blurred, and the interplay between the actor's body and machinery is becoming more thought-provoking. Meanwhile, the tension between globalization and localization, the rise of streaming services, and the emergence of immersive theatre offer new possibilities for the future of theatre and film.</p>

            <p>Theatre and film each have their own unique viewer-performer relationships: theatre emphasizes "presence," where the audience and actors share a collective experience of "here and now"; film relies on "immediacy," where the audience immerses themselves in the narrative of a virtual world in private spaces. The rise of streaming services and immersive theatre has redefined these relationships.</p>
