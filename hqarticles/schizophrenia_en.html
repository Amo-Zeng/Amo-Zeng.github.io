            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Schizophrenia, as a complex and challenging mental disorder, has long been misunderstood as "multiple personalities" or "split personalities." However, its true nature is far more intricate than a simple "split personality." It is a profound split within the inner world, akin to two facing mirrors that reflect each other but cannot merge. This article will explore the multidimensional interpretation of schizophrenia from three perspectives: "double mirrors," "social coding distortion," and "othering and de-stigmatization," revealing its internal mechanisms and social impacts.</p>

            <h2>Part One: Double Mirrors – The Split and Integration of the Inner World</h2>
            <h3>1. The Formation of Mirrors – The Roots of Splitting</h3>
            <p>The inner split in schizophrenia stems from the interplay of multiple factors. From a biological perspective, abnormalities in brain structure and function, particularly the imbalance of the dopamine system, provide the material basis for the formation of mirrors. From a psychological standpoint, childhood trauma and social isolation exacerbate the sense of inner splitting, creating two opposing selves.</p>
            <h3>2. The Opposition of Mirrors – Dual Experiences of Cognition and Emotion</h3>
            <p>The inner world of patients is akin to two reflecting mirrors, with cognition manifesting as dual experiences of reality and hallucination, reason and delusion, while emotions are intertwined with extremes such as love and hate, joy and sorrow, trust and suspicion.</p>
            <h3>3. The Interaction of Mirrors – Inner Dialogues and Struggles</h3>
            <p>Patients often hear inner voices, which may be commands, comments, or dialogues, forming a multi-voiced system within the mind. This inner dialogue and struggle are both a source of pain and a hope for self-redemption.</p>
            <h3>4. The Dissolution of Mirrors – The Possibility of Treatment and Integration</h3>
            <p>Pharmacological treatment attempts to resolve the opposition of mirrors by regulating brain chemicals and restoring inner unity. Psychological therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and family therapy help patients understand and integrate their fragmented selves.</p>

            <h2>Part Two: Social Coding Distortion – The Deep Mechanisms ofCommunication Dilemmas</h2>
            <h3>1. Definition and Manifestation of Social Coding Distortion</h3>
            <p>Social coding distortion refers to deviations or errors in the interpretation and generation of information during social interactions. It manifests as biased interpretation of information and障碍 in generating information, making it difficult for communication partners to understand the patient's true intentions.</p>
            <h3>2. Neural Mechanisms of Social Coding Distortion</h3>
            <p>Social coding distortion is closely related to abnormalities in specific brain regions, particularly the frontal-temporal network responsible for processing and integrating social information, which leads to comprehension difficulties.</p>
            <h3>3. Impact of Social Coding Distortion</h3>
            <p>Social coding distortion causes patients to gradually reduce their interactions with others, leading to the collapse of their social support networks and further exacerbating their condition, creating a vicious cycle.</p>
            <h3>4. Innovative Solutions</h3>
            <p>AI-based social training simulates real social scenarios to help patients practice and correct the interpretation and generation of social information. Neuromodulation therapy uses technology to train patients in regulating brain activity and improving social coding abilities.</p>

            <h2>Part Three: Othering and De-Stigmatization – Multidimensional Perspectives on Social Construction</h2>
            <h3>1. Othering: The Social Labeling of Schizophrenia</h3>
            <p>The authoritative nature of medical discourse grants schizophrenia objectivity and scientific validity, but it also simplifies it into a pathological phenomenon, overlooking its social and cultural contexts.</p>
            <h3>2. De-Stigmatization: Redefining Schizophrenia</h3>
            <p>The de-stigmatization movement advocates for a multifaceted view of schizophrenia, including the personal experiences of patients, family support systems, and adjustments in social policies.</p>
            <h3>3. Innovation: Dynamic Balance and the Return of Subjectivity</h3>
            <p>In exploring the social construction of schizophrenia, it is important to recognize that "othering" and "de-stigmatization" are not mutually exclusive but are intertwined processes in dynamic balance.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The multidimensional interpretation of schizophrenia reveals the split and integration of the inner world, the deep mechanisms of communication dilemmas, and the dynamic balance of social construction. Future research should continue to focus on the subjectivity of patients, driving a societal redefinition of schizophrenia and ultimately creating a more inclusive and understanding social environment.</p>
