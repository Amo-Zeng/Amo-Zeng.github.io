            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For a long time, history has often been simplified into grand narratives of heroes and great men, while the history of technology has been seen as a linear trajectory of technological progress. However, these grand narratives often overlook those who live on the fringes of society, the social forces that drive and hinder technological development, and seemingly trivial things such as migration, the circulation of goods, the spread of food, and the spread of diseases. These forgotten marginalized people, the "black boxes" in the history of technology, and the "micro perspectives" in global history, actually play a crucial role in the development of history and technology. Together, they shape the diversity and complexity of history, revealing the complex interactions between technology and society, politics, and culture.</p>

            <h2>Main Body</h2>
            <h3>Marginalized Groups: Diverse Witnesses of History</h3>
            <p>Firstly, the life experiences of marginalized groups provide different perspectives on history. During the Industrial Revolution, the living conditions and working conditions of factory workers are often overlooked, but these details are crucial for understanding the true impact of the Industrial Revolution. By studying the lives of these marginalized people, historians can reveal the actual impact of social change on ordinary people, thereby gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the historical process. For example, in the context of the colonial era, the experiences of the colonized are often ignored. However, their resistance and adaptation strategies provide a unique perspective on understanding the impact of colonialism on local social and cultural influences. By focusing on these marginalized groups, historians can reveal hidden social contradictions and inequalities in history, thus promoting social justice and understanding.</p>
            <h3>The "Black Box" in the History of Technology: The Battleground of Social Forces</h3>
            <p>The "black box" in the history of technology reveals that technological development has never been isolated but is deeply rooted in the social, political, and cultural soil. The role of social forces in driving and hindering technological development is evident. For example, the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century was not only due to the invention of the steam engine but also the result of the combined forces of market demand, capital accumulation, and social system reforms in Britain at that time. Similarly, the development of certain technologies may be hindered by social systems, such as in some countries where strict censorship may hinder the spread and development of internet technology. Technological development in turn shapes society and culture. The spread of the internet has not only changed the way people communicate but also redefined social relationships and cultural expression. The emergence of online platforms and social media has changed the way news is disseminated, public discussions, and political mobilization. Additionally, technological development has also influenced the form of cultural and artistic expression, such as the rise of digital art and virtual reality technology.</p>
            <h3>The "Micro Perspective" in Global History: The Bond of Culture and Society</h3>
            <p>Micro perspectives such as migration, the circulation of goods, the spread of food, and the spread of diseases play a crucial role in global history. Migration is not just the movement of people but also the spread and fusion of culture. For example, in the 19th century, a large number of European immigrants moved to America, bringing not only labor but also European culture, religion, and lifestyle. These immigrants created new cultural hybrids on the new land, influencing local social structures and cultural identity. The circulation of goods is also a key micro perspective in global history. The formation of global trade networks is not only due to political and economic needs but also because of the circulation of various goods. For example, the global trade of spices, silk, and tea not only promoted economic development but also facilitated cultural exchange. The spread of food is another important micro perspective in global history. Food is not only a necessity for survival but also an important part of culture. For example, the global spread of crops such as corn, potatoes, and tomatoes not only changed local dietary habits but also promoted cultural exchange and integration. The spread of diseases is also an important micro perspective in global history that cannot be ignored. The global spread of diseases not only has a profound impact on population health but also on social structures and culture. For example, the Black Death in the 14th century not only led to a sharp decline in the European population but also changed social structures and cultural concepts.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Focusing on forgotten marginalized groups, the "black box" in the history of technology, and the "micro perspective" in global history can reveal the diversity and complexity of history, the complex interactions between technology and society, politics, and culture, and the bonds of culture and society. By revealing these micro forces, historians can construct a more comprehensive and authentic historical picture, thereby promoting social understanding and progress. Future historical research and technological development should pay more attention to these neglected micro forces to gain a deeper insight into the true meaning of history and technology.</p>
