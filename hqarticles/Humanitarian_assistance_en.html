            <h2>Ethical Reconstruction of Humanitarian Aid: From Intervention to Empowerment</h2>
            <p>Traditional humanitarian aid models have caused deep erosion of recipient countries' economic structures, industrial foundations, and sovereign space under the guise of "goodwill." Through systematic case analysis and data support, this article reveals issues such as industrial destruction and power monopoly caused by aid, while proposing a valuable framework for ethical reconstruction.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Microeconomic Mechanisms of Industrial Ecosystem Destruction</h3>
            <p>Using the collapse of Haiti's rice industry (self-sufficiency rate dropping from 80% to 50%) as a case study, this reveals the destructive path of "well-intentioned dumping":</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Internationally donated food</strong> floods local markets as "free" goods</li>
                <li><strong>Local agricultural products</strong> lose price competitiveness</li>
                <li><strong>Farmer bankruptcies</strong> lead to abandoned farmland creating agricultural structural voids</li>
                <li><strong>Import dependency</strong> continues to rise</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This "aid-destruction" cycle essentially constitutes a covert form of "structural shock therapy," whose economic logic parallels the "loss of food sovereignty" experienced by Latin American countries in the 20th century.</p>

            <h3>Colonial Reconstruction of Knowledge-Power Systems</h3>
            <p>The phenomenon of "technological obfuscation" (such as Haiti's medical equipment procurement clauses with 70% additional costs) reflects neocolonial mechanisms of knowledge hegemony:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Aid providers establish technical standards, testing procedures, and logistics norms</li>
                <li>Effectively creating institutional barriers to recipient countries' decision-making space</li>
                <li>This power monopoly disguised under "procedural justice"</li>
                <li>Forms a contemporary parallel with "technological colonialism" in dependency theory</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Rent-Seeking Transformation of Aid Supply Chains</h3>
            <p>The "transportation-testing consortium" in global aid procurement (involving EU-designated laboratories, Schengen zone transport systems, etc.) constitutes a new mechanism for producing transnational governance rents.</p>
            <p>Research shows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Local supply solutions from developing countries have less than 12% success rate in aid tenders</li>
                <li>Exposing the "economic rent conversion" nature of humanitarian aid</li>
                <li>According to UN OCHA statistics, only 3.8% of global humanitarian funds in 2019 actually reached local economies</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practical Pathways for Ethical Reconstruction</h3>
            <p>The proposed "non-interventionist reconstruction" paradigm includes three innovative dimensions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Demand-side management:</strong> Establishing a "damage threshold" assessment system, exemplified by Kerala, India's "dynamic import quota adjustment mechanism" during 2022 floods</li>
                <li><strong>Supply-side innovation:</strong> Promoting "local production capacity-linked" procurement models, as seen in Kenya Red Cross-supported "local disaster relief production networks"</li>
                <li><strong>Institutional design:</strong> Adopting Latin America's proposed "sovereignty guarantee fund" mechanism, reserving 15% of international aid agreements for technology transfer and capacity building</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Theoretical Implications and Paradigm Shifts</h3>
            <p>The article's implicit development philosophy offers a realist revision to Rawls' "difference principle": In international aid contexts, achieving "the greatest benefit to the least advantaged" must transcend immediate utility considerations and establish intergenerational impact assessment systems.</p>
            <p>This "long-cycle justice perspective" resonates with Amartya Sen's capability approach, providing a value framework for Global South countries' aid reception models.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Suggested Future Research Directions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Elasticity modeling of aid impact versus economic resilience</li>
                <li>Adaptability studies of Local Procurement Priority (LPP) systems across different political systems</li>
                <li>Development of blockchain-based transparent aid fund tracking systems</li>
                <li>Exploration of legal accountability mechanisms for "aid harm" from a transnational comparative perspective</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This critical reflection marks a paradigm shift in global development studies from "intervention effectiveness" to "harm prevention," providing solid theoretical grounding for resetting development discourse in North-South relations.</p>
