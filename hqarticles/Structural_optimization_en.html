In the Chinese high school education system, **"Shu Jia"** (数学甲) typically refers to the **science-track advanced mathematics** course (also called **Mathematics A**) in certain provinces or regions (e.g., Shanghai’s "Mathematics Class A"). It is a compulsory mathematics course for science-track students, offering deeper and broader content compared to humanities-track mathematics (**"Shu Yi"**), with a stronger emphasis on logical reasoning and abstract thinking.  

### **Key Topics in Shu Jia**  
1. **Functions & Calculus**  
   - Function properties, derivatives, integrals, and applications (e.g., extrema, area calculations).  

2. **Algebra & Sequences**  
   - Complex numbers, polynomials, higher-degree equations, recursive sequences, mathematical induction.  

3. **Solid Geometry & Vectors**  
   - Spatial figures, vectors in 3D, calculations of angles and distances.  

4. **Probability & Statistics**  
   - Conditional probability, random variables, probability distributions, statistical inference (e.g., normal distribution).  

5. **Extended Topics**  
   - Some regions may include introductory linear algebra (e.g., matrices) or competition-related content.

### **Comparison with Humanities Math (Shu Yi)**  
| **Aspect**       | Shu Jia (Science Track)               | Shu Yi (Humanities Track)           |  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|  
| **Difficulty**   | Higher; abstract thinking emphasized  | More foundational; application-focused |  
| **Scope**        | Covers calculus, complex numbers, 3D vectors | Omits advanced topics (e.g., integrals) |  
| **Exams**        | Gaokao science math papers (e.g., National I) | Gaokao humanities math papers (e.g., National II) |

### **Study Tips**  
- **Master Fundamentals**: Shu Jia demands strong skills in functions and algebraic manipulations; ensure fluency in formula derivations.  
- **Practice Critical Thinking**: Focus on proof-based and comprehensive problems (e.g., combining derivatives with inequalities).  
- **Link to Real-World Contexts**: Calculus and statistics often involve modeling real scenarios; understand problem-solving frameworks.  
- **Resources**: Recommended textbooks include PEP A Edition (Science Electives) or Shanghai Tech’s *Mathematics (Class A)*. For practice, use *Five Years of Gaokao, Three Years of Simulation (Science Math)*.
