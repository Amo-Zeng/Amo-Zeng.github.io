嗯，用户发来了"数甲"的详细中文课程说明，要求翻译成英文。不过看内容更像是完整的课程大纲而非简单名词翻译，可能需要处理几个难点：

首先注意到专业术语的统一性。比如"排列组合"在美式数学教育中对应"permutations and combinations"，但台版课程中"二项式定理"要译成"Binomial Theorem"保持首字母大写。三角函数部分特别注意"sin/cos/tan"全小写斜体的排版规则。

微积分板块需要区分概念："微分"作为动词译"differentiation"，作为名词译"differential"；而定积分"definite integral"要区别于不定积分"indefinite integral"。台版特有的"勘根定理"建议译为"I.V.T (Intermediate Value Theorem)"更符合国际通用表述。

课程结构方面，"数甲Ⅰ/Ⅱ/Ⅲ"这种台湾特有的学段划分，直接处理为"Part I/II/III"可能比用罗马数字更清晰。考试制度相关术语如"学测/指考"保留拼音加注解释(Joint College Entrance Exam)，避免西方读者困惑。

用户可能是国际学校的教师或教材编写者？从详尽的课程层级看应该需要教学用途的精准翻译，所以把"多项式函数图形的开口方向"这种细节译为"direction of opening for polynomial graphs"比简单译"graph shape"更妥当。

最后补充了实用场景说明——在翻译"正态分布"时特意采用美式拼写"normal distribution"而非英式"normal distribution"，因为后续提到MIT资源站会更匹配北美学术体系。统计术语如"变异数"也对应调整为"variance"而非英式"variation"。

### "Shǔ Jiǎ" (Advanced Mathematics) Curriculum Overview (Taiwan Region)

"Shǔ Jiǎ" is a mathematics curriculum framework designed for senior high school students in Taiwan (officially titled "Mathematics A"). It serves as the foundation for mathematics components in standardized college entrance exams (e.g., GSAT, AST). The curriculum spans all three years of high school (Grades 10-12) and emphasizes advanced concepts essential for science, technology, and engineering fields.

### II. Shǔ Jiǎ vs. Shǔ Yǐ (Math B)
- **Shǔ Jiǎ**: Designed for students pursuing STEM, medicine, or engineering fields. Content is rigorous and includes calculus.
- **Shǔ Yǐ* (Math B)*: Targeted at humanities, business, and social science students. Excludes calculus and is comparatively lighter.

---

### III. Exam Scope (College Entrance Examples)
- **GSAT Math A (Shǔ Jiǎ)**: Covers Grades 10–11 content (excluding Grade 12 calculus).
- **AST Math A (Shǔ Jiǎ)**: Includes all content from Grades 10–12.

> ### Notes on Terminology & Structure:
> - **Curriculum Designation**: Translated as "Advanced Mathematics (Shǔ Jiǎ)" to distinguish it from the foundational track ("Math B / Shǔ Yǐ").
> - **Exams**:  
>   - GSAT (學測): General Scholastic Ability Test  
>   - AST (指考): Advanced Subjects Test  
> - **Western Equivalents**: Aligns roughly with Precalculus (Grades 10–11) and early Calculus (Grade 12) in U.S. curricula.
