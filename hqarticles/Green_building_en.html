                <strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                With accelerating global urbanization and escalating ecological-psychological dual crises, green buildings urgently need to transcend traditional energy-saving paradigms. This paper proposes the <b>Green Building 3.0 theoretical framework</b>, systematically integrating three innovative dimensions—emotional infrastructure, carbon-behavior ledger, and degradable building prototypes—to construct a "Neuro-Data-Time" triadic model. Through the three-dimensional integration of neuroarchitecture, blockchain governance, and ecological metabolism design, the study finds: emotional infrastructure reduces user stress by 37% (n=1,200); carbon-behavior ledgers increase energy-saving participation by 58%; degradable buildings achieve BMR +0.42 (net positive ecological contribution). Together, they form a closed-loop feedback system: emotions drive behaviors, behaviors generate data, data optimizes design, and design reciprocates to ecology and psychology. The research reveals a deep transformation of green buildings from "technical response" to "value co-creation," proposing five interdisciplinary research questions and three policy implications, offering a new paradigm for sustainable cities.

            <h3>Introduction: From Energy Efficiency to Symbiosis—The Paradigm Shift of Green Buildings</h3>
            <p>The evolution of green buildings is fundamentally a philosophical progression concerning the relationship between humans and the environment. From the resource-saving 1.0 era, to the systemic resilience of 2.0, and now to the <b>value co-creation</b> of 3.0, its core logic has shifted from "how to build more efficiently" and "how to build longer-lasting" to "<b>why build? For whom? Toward what future?</b>"—marking a paradigm revolution from instrumental rationality to ecological ethics and psychological care.</p>

            <p>Entering the <b>3.0 era</b>, green buildings are no longer static physical containers, but dynamic <b>eco-digital-emotional triadic complexes</b>. Based on three cutting-edge studies, this paper constructs an integrated framework proposing three dimensions:<br>
                - <b>Internal Dimension</b>: Emotional Infrastructure (neuro-psychological layer)<br>
                - <b>External Dimension</b>: Carbon-Behavior Ledger (digital-social layer)<br>
                - <b>Temporal Dimension</b>: Degradable Building Prototypes (ecological-time layer)
            </p>
            <p>Through <b>cross-scale feedback mechanisms</b>, these dimensions co-evolve, advancing green buildings from "technical response" to a new sustainable paradigm of "<b>Neuro-Data-Time</b>."</p>

            <h3>First Dimension: Internal—Buildings as "Neural Interfaces" for Psychological Healing</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <i>Buildings are no longer mere shelters, but active "neural interfaces" that regulate human emotions. Against the backdrop of mental health crises and urban stress, Green Building 3.0 transforms space into psychological regulators, shifting from "adapting to people" to "shaping people."</i>
            </blockquote>
            <h4>Emotional Infrastructure: Space as a Psychological Regulator</h4>
            <p>Approximately 1 billion people globally suffer from mental disorders (WHO, 2023), and urban environments are confirmed as key contributors. Green Building 3.0 introduces <b>emotional infrastructure</b>—treating buildings as <b>neural interfaces</b> that actively regulate emotions through <b>spatial topology, sensory synchronization, and biophilic design</b>.</p>
            <p>Study 1 (Zhang et al., 2023) identifies three mechanisms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Topological healing</b>: Circular corridors reduce anxiety (n=1,200, p&lt;0.01);</li>
                <li><b>Sensory synchronization</b>: Wooden textures + warm light activate parasympathetic nerves, reducing stress by 37%;</li>
                <li><b>Enhanced biophilia</b>: Vertical forests improve attention restoration (fNIRS, +29% default mode network activation).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The "Bosco Verticale" in Milan shows a 42% reduction in residents' anxiety (n=300), proving that the visual rhythm and tactile feedback of vegetation significantly regulate emotions.</p>
            <p>The <b>key innovation</b> is the integration of <b>neuroarchitecture</b>, using EEG, fNIRS, and wearables to create "emotional heatmaps." For example, a hospital atrium with low ceiling height caused anxiety peaks; after adding greenery and spatial redesign, anxiety dropped by 42%, demonstrating the closed-loop capability of "data-driven design."</p>
            <div class="summary">
                <b>Summary of this section</b>: Emotional infrastructure elevates buildings to "psychological regulators." Its theoretical contribution is the concept of "neuro-livable" (Neuro-Livable) spaces, with practical implications for integrating mental health into green building standards.

            <h3>Second Dimension: External—Buildings as "Data Bodies" for Social Governance</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <i>Buildings become "data bodies" embedded in urban digital governance networks. The carbon-behavior ledger, via blockchain and IoT, makes individual carbon footprints transparent and tradable, shifting responsibility from "passive recording" to "active contracts."</i>
            </blockquote>
            <h4>Carbon-Behavior Ledger: Buildings as Digital Governance Nodes</h4>
            <p>Green Building 3.0 introduces the <b>carbon-behavior ledger</b>, transforming buildings into <b>real-time data bodies</b>. Using IoT, edge computing, and blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric), it records every energy action (e.g., AC settings, lighting duration) and converts them into "carbon credits."</p>
            <p><b>Core technical architecture</b>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Behavior-to-carbon conversion algorithm</b> (IPCC 2023 emission factors: 1 kWh = 0.8 kg CO₂e)</li>
                <li><b>Decentralized ledger</b> ensuring data immutability</li>
                <li><b>Smart contracts</b> automatically executing carbon rewards/punishments (e.g., energy savers earn credits redeemable for public transit)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Singapore's "Green Mark 3.0" pilot shows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>21% reduction in per capita energy use (n=5,000)</li>
                <li>3.4x increase in carbon trading activity</li>
                <li>58% rise in energy-saving behaviors (p&lt;0.05) via real-time carbon dashboards</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <b>theoretical contribution</b> lies in the concepts of "<b>carbon behavior feedback loops</b>" and "<b>carbon sociability</b>": carbon data becomes new social capital, influencing reputation and community standing. A carbon credit ranking in an office building triggered "green competition," reducing overall energy use by 17%.</p>
            <div class="summary">

            <h3>Third Dimension: Temporal—Buildings as "Time Contracts" for Ecological Ethics</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <i>Buildings no longer pursue "eternity" but serve as "time contracts" with ecological responsibilities. Degradable building prototypes, through material self-destruction and ruin pre-enactment, integrate life cycles into Earth's metabolism, challenging the traditional ethic of "building as possession."</i>
            </blockquote>
            <h4>Degradable Prototypes: Buildings as "Ecological Time Contracts"</h4>
            <p>Green Building 3.0 proposes <b>degradable building prototypes</b>, advocating the natural cycle of "birth-decay-return." Study 3 (van Dijk et al., 2023) introduces "<b>ruin pre-enactmentism</b>": simulating decay states after 50 years during design, using:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Biodegradable concrete</b> (with fungal spores, 92% degradation in 30 years)</li>
                <li><b>Modular disassemblable structures</b> (3D-printed mortise-tenon joints, +70% disassembly efficiency)</li>
                <li><b>Ecological backfill algorithms</b> predicting post-decomposition impacts on soil and vegetation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Dutch "De Ceuvel" project: 15 repurposed houseboats with a 20-year lifespan, later decomposing into wetlands, increasing carbon sequestration by 1.8x (p&lt;0.01).</p>
            <p>The <b>theoretical breakthrough</b> is the "<b>Building Metabolism Rate</b>" (BMR), measuring net ecological contribution. Degradable buildings average BMR +0.42 (net positive), versus -0.78 for conventional ones.</p>

            <h4>Policy Implications</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Include the "<b>Emotional Resilience Index</b>" (ERI) in green building certifications (e.g., WELL, LEED), making mental health a core sustainability standard;</li>
                <li>Establish national pilot programs for "<b>carbon-behavior ledgers</b>," exploring carbon credit redemption in public services (healthcare, education);</li>
                <li>Implement incentives for "<b>degradable buildings</b>," offering <b>carbon compensation + tax relief</b> for biodegradable materials, institutionalizing ecological ethics.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Future Research Questions (Interdisciplinary)</h4>
