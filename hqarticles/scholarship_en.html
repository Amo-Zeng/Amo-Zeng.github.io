            <h2>Introduction: The Foundation of Educational Equity</h2>
            <p>Educational equity is the cornerstone of social equity, and scholarships, as an important means of redistributing educational resources, carry the hopes and dreams of countless underprivileged students. However, traditional scholarship models have many drawbacks, such as subjectivity, inefficiency, and lack of transparency, which are difficult to meet the demands of modern educational equity. With the rise of the digital wave and the introduction of psychological support and community co-creation concepts, an unprecedented opportunity has been provided for the reform and reconstruction of the scholarship system.</p>

            <h3>1. Digital Management: The Necessary Path for Scholarship Reform</h3>
            <p>Digital management is key to improving the fairness, efficiency, and transparency of scholarships and is the necessary path for scholarship reform.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Dilemma of Traditional Models:</strong> Subjectivity, inefficiency, lack of transparency.</li>
                <li><strong>Opportunities of Digital Management:</strong> Precise identification, efficient and convenient, public and transparent.</li>
                <li><strong>Implementation Plan:</strong> Build an integrated digital platform, establish multiple levels of data security protection mechanisms, strengthen digital talent training.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Psychological Support: From Material Assistance to Emotional Care</h3>
            <p>The lack of material resources is only part of the difficulties faced by underprivileged students; they often also bear multiple psychological pressures from society, family, and themselves. Ignoring mental health issues not only affects students' learning and quality of life but may also lead to more serious consequences. Therefore, while providing financial assistance, establishing a "Scholarship Psychological Support Program" to deeply focus on the mental growth of underprivileged students has become an urgent topic of the times.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Current Situation of Mental Health Issues:</strong> Inferiority and sensitivity, anxiety and depression, strained interpersonal relationships.</li>
                <li><strong>Significance of Psychological Support:</strong> Improve learning efficiency, promote personality perfection, prevent psychological crises.</li>
                <li><strong>Implementation Plan:</strong> Establish professional student psychological archives, set up a special fund for psychological counseling, carry out diversified mental health education, build a peer support network, and collaborate among families, schools, and communities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Community Co-creation: From Charitable Alms to Two-way Empowerment</h3>
            <p>Traditional scholarship models treat recipients as passive receivers, ignoring their subjective initiative and development potential. Although this model can alleviate economic difficulties in the short term, it is difficult to fundamentally help recipients achieve self-development. The "Scholarship Community Participation Model" aims to break this one-way funding model, emphasizing that recipients actively participate in community construction while receiving financial assistance, contributing their own strength, and realizing the transformation from "charitable alms" to "two-way empowerment."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limitations of Traditional Models:</strong> One-way funding, difficult to sustain.</li>
                <li><strong>Significance of Community Co-creation:</strong> Stimulate intrinsic motivation, promote social integration, achieve sustainable development.</li>
                <li><strong>Implementation Plan:</strong> Conduct needs research for precise matching, operate through project systems to establish long-term mechanisms, encourage multi-party participation for collaborative governance, assess and feedback for continuous improvement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion: Comprehensively Empowering Underprivileged Students</h3>
            <p>Reconstructing the scholarship system requires us to start from the three dimensions of digital management, psychological support, and community co-creation, constructing a more equitable, efficient, transparent, and vibrant scholarship system. Digital management is the foundation, psychological support is the guarantee, and community co-creation is the goal. Only by combining material assistance with emotional care and community participation can we truly help underprivileged students out of困境, achieve comprehensive physical and mental development, and become the new generation capable of shouldering the great task of national rejuvenation.</p>
