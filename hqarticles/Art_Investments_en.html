            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Art investment, once considered a capital game based on intuition, emotion, and scarcity, is undergoing a profound and comprehensive transformation. The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), sustainability, and globalization trends is redefining the logic and value of art investment.</p>

            <h3>AI Reshapes Art Pricing Mechanisms: Revolution from Intuition to Data</h3>
            <p>In the traditional art market, pricing often relies on experts' subjective judgments, artists' reputations, and market scarcity. While this model is rich in artistic flair, it is also fraught with uncertainty and human bias. The involvement of AI has brought revolutionary changes to art pricing mechanisms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Big Data Analysis:</strong> AI, through big data analysis and machine learning, can extract potential patterns influencing art value from vast historical transaction data, auction records, and artists' trajectories.</li>
                <li><strong>Image Recognition Technology:</strong> AI's image recognition technology can also classify art styles and authenticate works, further enhancing the scientific and accurate nature of pricing.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Dual Value of Art Investment: Environment, Society, and Sustainability</h3>
            <p>Meanwhile, art investment is transcending the single objective of economic returns, gradually integrating broader social and environmental responsibilities. Ecological art, social issue art, and works created with sustainable materials are becoming new market favorites.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Ecological Art:</strong> Works created with recycled materials not only possess unique artistic expression but also convey support for sustainability.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Issue Art:</strong> By supporting these artists, investors not only create economic value but also actively participate in environmental protection and social issue resolution.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h3>Cross-Cultural Art Investment: Cultural Fusion under Globalization</h3>
            <p>In the context of globalization, cross-cultural art investment is becoming an emerging trend, breaking the geographical and cultural limitations of traditional art investment.</p>
            <p>The significance of cross-cultural art investment lies not only in investment returns but also in cultural exchange and value recognition. By collecting artworks from different cultures, investors can deepen their understanding and appreciation of diverse civilizations, promoting cultural fusion and传承.</p>

            <h3>Symbiosis of AI, Sustainability, and Globalization: A New Paradigm for Art Investment</h3>
            <p>When we combine AI, sustainability, and globalization trends, a new paradigm for art investment gradually emerges. AI enhances the transparency and scientific nature of art pricing through data-driven methods; sustainability gives art investment broader social and environmental value; and globalization breaks down geographical and cultural barriers, providing investors with a wider range of choices.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In summary, AI, sustainability, and globalization are reshaping the logic and value of art investment. This transformation not only offers new opportunities for investors but also injects new vitality into the global art market.</p>
