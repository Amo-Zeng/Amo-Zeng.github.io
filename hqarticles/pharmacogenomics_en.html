            <h3>Social Psychological Impact: The Mental Dilemma of Genetic Interpretation</h3>
            <p>The interpretation of genetic information is a double-edged sword: it can help people discover disease risks earlier and intervene early, but it may also cause excessive concern about their health, or even doubt their own value. Especially under the influence of genetic determinism, some people may attribute their health issues entirely to genes, ignoring environmental factors and personal behavior, leading to negative emotions such as pessimism and anxiety.</p>
            <p><strong>Addressing the Psychological Challenges of Genetic Interpretation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mental Health Education:</strong> Strengthen mental health education and counseling to guide the public to understand genetic information correctly and rationalize the results of genetic testing.</li>
                <li><strong>Psychological Counseling and Intervention:</strong> Build a comprehensive psychological counseling and intervention mechanism to provide timely and effective help for those who are psychologically distressed due to genetic information.</li>
                <li><strong>Media Propaganda:</strong> Strengthen media propaganda, avoid exaggerating the role of genetic testing, avoid rendering genetic determinism, and guide the public to form a scientific and rational understanding of genes.</li>
            </ul>
