            <h2>The Evolution and Challenges of JSON: A Multidimensional Exploration from Data Exchange to Universal Data Structure</h2>
            <p>Since its standardization by Douglas Crockford in 2001, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) has become an indispensable part of modern software development. This article delves into the evolution of JSON, the challenges it faces, and its future directions.</p>

            <h3>The Evolution of JSON: From Data Exchange to Universal Data Structure</h3>
            <p>JSON originated from JavaScript's object literal notation, initially emerging as a lightweight data exchange format, gradually evolving into a universal data structure.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Origins and Rise in the Data Exchange Era:</strong> JSON rapidly replaced XML to become the mainstream data format, widely popular for its simplicity, readability, platform independence, and native JavaScript support.</li>
                <li><strong>As a Configuration File Format:</strong> JSON is used as a configuration file format, offering better readability and expressiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>Application in NoSQL Databases:</strong> Many NoSQL databases directly support data storage and querying in JSON format.</li>
                <li><strong>JSON Schema and Data Validation:</strong> JSON Schema allows developers to describe the structure, types, and constraints of data, ensuring data integrity and consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration with Web APIs:</strong> JSON has become the primary data format for Web APIs, its simplicity and ease of use making it the preferred choice for API design.</li>
                <li><strong>Rise as a Universal Data Structure:</strong> JSON has gradually transcended its role in data exchange to become a universal data structure, applied in various scenarios.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limitations of JSON and Alternative Solutions: Exploring the Future of Data Exchange</h3>
            <p>Despite its tremendous success in the field of data exchange, JSON's limitations in handling complex data structures, performance optimization, and cross-language interaction are becoming increasingly evident.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Type Restrictions:</strong> JSON's basic data types are insufficient for handling complex data structures, lacking native support for binary data.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Issues:</strong> JSON's text-based format leads to performance bottlenecks when dealing with large-scale data.</li>
                <li><strong>Complexity in Cross-Language Interaction:</strong> Differences in how various languages handle JSON add complexity to cross-language development.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Schema Constraints:</strong> JSON's schema-less nature can lead to inconsistent data formats.</li>
                <li><strong>Alternative Solutions:</strong> New data exchange formats like Protocol Buffers, Apache Thrift, MessagePack, and Avro are gradually gaining prominence.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>JSON and Data Security: Privacy Protection and Access Control</h3>
            <p>With the widespread application of JSON in data exchange, data security issues have increasingly become a focal point of attention.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> Data encryption and anonymization are crucial measures for safeguarding privacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Authentication and permission management ensure secure access to data.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Future Outlook</h3>
            <p>Future data exchange formats will prioritize performance, flexibility, and security, combined with emerging privacy protection technologies, to promote the application of data security in more scenarios.</p>
