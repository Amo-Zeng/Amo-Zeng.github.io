            <h2>The Evolution and Challenges of JSON: A Multidimensional Exploration from Data Exchange to Universal Data Structure</h2>
            <p>Since its standardization by Douglas Crockford in 2001, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) has become an indispensable part of modern software development. This article delves into JSON's evolutionary journey, the challenges it faces, and its future development directions.</p>

            <h3>JSON's Evolution: From Data Exchange to Universal Data Structure</h3>
            <p>Originating from JavaScript's object literal notation, JSON initially served as a lightweight data exchange format and gradually evolved into a universal data structure.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Origins and Rise in the Data Exchange Era:</strong> JSON quickly replaced XML as the mainstream data format, gaining popularity due to its simplicity, readability, platform independence, and native JavaScript support.</li>
                <li><strong>As Configuration File Format:</strong> JSON is used as a configuration file format, offering better readability and expressiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>Application in NoSQL Databases:</strong> Many NoSQL databases natively support JSON format for data storage and queries.</li>
                <li><strong>JSON Schema and Data Validation:</strong> JSON Schema allows developers to describe data structures, types, and constraints, ensuring data integrity and consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration with Web APIs:</strong> JSON has become the primary data format for Web APIs, with its simplicity and ease of use making it the preferred choice for API design.</li>
                <li><strong>Rise as Universal Data Structure:</strong> JSON has gradually transcended its role in data exchange to become a universal data structure applied in various scenarios.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>JSON's Limitations and Alternatives: Exploring the Future of Data Exchange</h3>
            <p>Despite JSON's tremendous success in data exchange, its limitations in handling complex data structures, performance optimization, and cross-language interactions are becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Type Limitations:</strong> JSON's basic data types struggle with complex data structures and lack native support for binary data.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Issues:</strong> JSON's text format creates performance bottlenecks when processing large-scale data.</li>
                <li><strong>Complexity in Cross-Language Interactions:</strong> Different programming languages may process JSON differently, increasing complexity in cross-language development.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Schema Constraints:</strong> As a schema-less data format, JSON may lead to inconsistent data formats.</li>
                <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> New data exchange formats like Protocol Buffers, Apache Thrift, MessagePack, and Avro are emerging.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>JSON and Data Security: Privacy Protection and Access Control</h3>
            <p>With JSON's widespread use in data exchange, data security has become a growing concern.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> Data encryption and anonymization are crucial methods for privacy protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Authentication and permission management ensure secure data access.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Future Outlook</h3>
            <p>Future data exchange formats will place greater emphasis on performance, flexibility, and security, incorporating emerging privacy protection technologies to promote data security in more scenarios.</p>
