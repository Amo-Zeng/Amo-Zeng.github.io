            <h2>Re-exploring Leninism in the Technological Revolution</h2>
            <p>In the early 20th century, Leninism laid the foundation for the socialist movement by emphasizing the proletarian class struggle and centralized economic planning. However, the technological revolution of the 21st century, particularly technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, and blockchain, is disrupting traditional economic management models. With the prevalence of AI and big data, the structure of productivity has undergone major changes, giving rise to new social classes, while the traditional working class may face the risk of automation. At this point, a society based on the Leninist framework needs to redefine class struggle to adapt to changes in the labor market and social structure.</p>
            <p>The decentralized nature of blockchain technology starkly contrasts with the centralized planned economy of Leninism. Blockchain improves resource allocation efficiency and reduces information asymmetry by enhancing information transparency and achieving trust automation. However, exploring and practicing a new economic model that combines decentralized efficiency with national management goals remains necessary.</p>

            <h2>Application of Leninism in the Ecological Crisis</h2>
            <p>In the face of the global ecological crisis, Leninism's collective ownership provides theoretical support for sustainable resource management. Within the Leninist framework, collective ownership can promote long-term ecological protection and reduce over-exploitation of resources caused by private ownership. However, the centralized management model needs innovation in the modern context to avoid issues of information asymmetry and governance inefficiency, and to enhance environmental monitoring and policy flexibility through modern technological means. In terms of international environmental cooperation, Leninism advocates for collective action to address global challenges, offering a positive mobilization perspective to current ecological governance.</p>

            <h2>Exploring New Paths in Gender Equality</h2>
            <p>Leninism in the 20th century already focused on gender equality, advocating for women's liberation through changes in economic structure. However, in today's society, the gender equality movement has entered a new phase, demanding more complex and diverse theoretical perspectives. Leninism can provide a unique class analysis framework to help understand the complex relationship between gender inequality and structural economic issues. At the same time, the cross-cultural and diverse perspectives introduced by modern gender movements can enrich and enhance Leninist theory, making it more suited to the current globalized social context.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Modern technology, ecological challenges, and social equality movements offer abundant opportunities to re-examine and shape Leninism. The technological revolution not only advances social productivity but also provides possibilities for exploring new economic models within Leninism; the concept of ecological civilization emphasizes collective resource management and international cooperation; the gender equality movement strengthens the social justice aspect of its theoretical framework. Through the integration of these three aspects, Leninism can not only achieve new breakthroughs theoretically but also provide a new perspective for 21st-century social governance. This is not only an update on traditional thought but also an important guideline for future development.</p>
