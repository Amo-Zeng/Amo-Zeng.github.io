            <h2>From "Hydrogen Race" to "Hydrogen Ecosystem": Building a Livable Future with Multi-Energy Complementarity</h2>
            <p>Hydrogen energy has long been regarded as a key to the "future energy race," with countries competing fiercely to develop it. From a traditional perspective, hydrogen is not only an important part of energy transition but also a symbol of national competitiveness and energy security. However, this competitive model has led to some issues. Instead of treating hydrogen as a competitive chip, it is better to build a "hydrogen ecosystem" and "hydrogen logistics ecosystem" to promote international cooperation and achieve win-win outcomes.</p>

            <h3>Traditional Perspective: Intense Competition in the Hydrogen Race</h3>
            <p>The competition for hydrogen extends beyond technology development to include infrastructure construction, market expansion, and the formulation of policies and regulations. However, the dispersion of resources and funds leads to low research efficiency, with many projects being duplicated and valuable resources being wasted. The lack of unified standards and norms hinders international hydrogen trade and technical exchanges, limiting the overall development of the global market.</p>

            <h3>New Perspective: Building a "Hydrogen Ecosystem" and "Hydrogen Logistics Ecosystem"</h3>
            <p>The hydrogen ecosystem emphasizes an open, inclusive, and collaborative development environment where participants cooperate to share resources, technology, and markets, jointly promoting the comprehensive development of the hydrogen industry. While building the hydrogen ecosystem, we should also expand the application scenarios of hydrogen, extending from a single "hydrogen truck" to the entire logistics industry chain, forming a closed-loop "hydrogen logistics ecosystem."</p>

            <h3>From Single Fuel to "Multi-Energy Complementarity": Creating a Livable Future for "Hydrogen Cities"</h3>
            <p>Combining hydrogen with other clean energies to create "multi-energy complementarity" in "hydrogen cities" can potentially build smarter and more livable future cities. In "hydrogen cities," hydrogen can serve as the link for energy storage and transmission, balancing energy supply and demand fluctuations. The "Hydrogen House" project in Aarhus, Denmark, demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of multi-energy complementarity in practical applications.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>International Cooperation and Future Prospects</h3>
            <p>The future should place greater emphasis on collaboration between countries in hydrogen technology, infrastructure, policies, and regulations, building an open, inclusive, and sustainable "hydrogen ecosystem." The EU, Japan, South Korea, and other countries have already started cooperation in hydrogen trade and technology sharing. Such cooperation not only promotes technological advancements in each country but also drives the unification of global hydrogen standards.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Summary and Call to Action</h3>
            <p>Through international cooperation, building an open, inclusive, and sustainable "hydrogen ecosystem" and "hydrogen logistics ecosystem," we can not only achieve win-win outcomes but also jointly address climate change challenges and promote global sustainable development. We call on governments, enterprises, research institutions, and the public to participate together, increase investment, promote technological innovation, and improve the policy support system to create a better, cleaner, and more livable future city.</p>
