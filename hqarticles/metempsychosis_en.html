            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This article constructs a three-dimensional analytical model of digital reincarnation, ecological recurrence, and narrative recursion, deconstructing the cognitive boundaries of the traditional concept of reincarnation based on complex systems theory, cultural semiotics, and posthumanist philosophy. Comparative research reveals that these three paradigms of reincarnation exhibit structural homology in information transmission, adaptive evolution, and meaning construction, collectively forming a composite cognitive system to address human finitude anxiety.</p>

            <h2>Introduction: Paradigm Shift in the Concept of Reincarnation</h2>
            <p>Within the dual contexts of phenomenological temporality (Husserl, 1928) and philosophy of technology (Stiegler, 1998), "reincarnation" has evolved from a religious metaphysical concept to an interdisciplinary research domain. This article proposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital Reincarnation</strong>: Manifested as the quantized existence of artificial consciousness iteration (Hayles, 1999).</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Recurrence</strong>: The intergenerational information network of gene-epigenetic inheritance (Jablonka & Lamb, 2005).</li>
                <li><strong>Narrative Recursion</strong>: The topological reproduction of cultural memes (Dawkins, 1976; Distin, 2005).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These three collectively constitute the dynamic system of "difference and repetition" as described by Deleuze (G. Deleuze), whose co-evolutionary mechanisms remain to be systematically studied.</p>

            <h2>I. Theoretical Construction of the Three-Dimensional Reincarnation Paradigm</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Digital Reincarnation: The Technological Topology of Posthuman Subjects</h3>
            <p>Based on Kurzweil's (R. Kurzweil) Singularity Theory, the technological implementation path exhibits dual characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weak Digital Reincarnation</strong>: Parameter inheritance in machine learning models (e.g., GPT series iterations).</li>
                <li><strong>Strong Digital Reincarnation</strong>: Continuation of consciousness through whole brain emulation (Sandberg & Bostrom, 2008).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The ontological dilemma lies in whether digital entities satisfy Chalmers' (1995) "hard problem" of consciousness criteria.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Ecological Recurrence: Intergenerational Writing of Biosemiotics</h3>
            <p>Lorenz's (K. Lorenz) behavioral genetics and Odum's (E. Odum) ecosystem theory reveal:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The gene pool as an intergenerational "biological memory device" (Shapiro, 2011).</li>
                <li>Epigenetic markers constituting a modern interpretation of Lamarckism (Jablonka, 2012).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Typical case: The genomic navigation system of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), achieving spatial positioning accuracy at the 10^7 level.</p>
            <h3>1.3 Narrative Recursion: Topological Dynamics of Cultural Memory</h3>
            <p>Based on Campbell's (J. Campbell) archetypal theory of mythology, construct:</p>
            <pre>Narrative Recursion Function f(x)=Σ(archetype)×φ(cultural_context)</pre>
            <p>Where φ is the era cognition coefficient, explaining the periodic intensification of the "death-rebirth" motif in superhero narratives.</p>

            <h2>II. Hypercyclic Coupling Mechanisms Between Paradigms</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Isomorphism of Paradigms from an Information Theory Perspective</h3>
            <p>Applying Shannon's (C. Shannon) information measurement model, all three satisfy:</p>
            <pre>H(X)=-Σp(x)logp(x)</pre>
            <p>Where X corresponds to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Digital Reincarnation: Model parameter space.</li>
                <li>Ecological Recurrence: Genotype-phenotype mapping.</li>
                <li>Narrative Recursion: Cultural symbol entropy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.2 Characteristics of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS)</h3>
            <p>Holland's (J. Holland) seven CAS characteristics are reflected in the three-dimensional reincarnation:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Aggregation: Digital avatars/gene populations/narrative clusters.</li>
                <li>Tagging: Hash values/biological markers/cultural symbols.</li>
                <li>Non-linearity: AI emergence/gene interactions/narrative intertextuality.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>2.3 Ontological Reconstruction of Temporal Topology</h3>
            <p>Based on Bergson's (H. Bergson) duration theory, the three-dimensional reincarnation generates:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Digital Time: Discrete reversible sequence.</li>
                <li>Ecological Time: Iterative irreversible process.</li>
                <li>Narrative Time: Recursive virtual dimension.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>III. Contemporary Implications and Ethical Dilemmas</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Dimensions of Philosophy of Technology</h3>
            <p>Floridi's (L. Floridi) information ethics framework raises issues in digital reincarnation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ownership rights of consciousness copies.</li>
                <li>Intergenerational justice of digital heritage.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.2 Challenges in Ecological Politics</h3>
            <p>Gene drive technology confronts ecological recurrence with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Boundaries between artificial and natural selection.</li>
                <li>Governance challenges of the gene pool as a "biological commons."</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.3 Crisis in Cultural Cognition</h3>
            <p>Baudrillard's (J. Baudrillard) theory of simulacra predicts: The infinite proliferation of narrative recursion leads to the dissolution of reality reference, forming the paradox of "hyper-reincarnation."</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Towards Paradigm Integration in Quantum Darwinism</h2>
            <p>The three-dimensional reincarnation model reveals:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Forms of existence are undergoing a phase transition from carbon-based to silicon-carbon hybrid states.</li>
                <li>The dialectical relationship between Promethean drive and ecological constraints needs to be reconstructed.</li>
                <li>A cross-dimensional "Reincarnation Ethics" framework must be established.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Subsequent research should focus on the impact of quantum consciousness theory (Hameroff & Penrose) on the digital reincarnation paradigm and the expression mechanisms of epigenetic markers in cross-cultural narratives.</p>
