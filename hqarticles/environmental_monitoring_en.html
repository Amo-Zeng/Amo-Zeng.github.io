      <h2>Potential Impact of Blockchain Technology on Future Society</h2>
      <p>As a decentralized, distributed ledger technology, blockchain is gradually changing our perceptions of trust, ownership, and data management. It not only enhances the transparency of financial systems but may also reshape government governance, healthcare, supply chain management, and even social relationships.</p>

      <h3>Redefining Trust Mechanisms</h3>
      <p>Blockchain provides a trust infrastructure without intermediaries for the digital society through its immutable and transparent characteristics.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Financial Services:</strong> Smart contracts automatically execute transactions, reducing reliance on banks or governments.</li>
        <li><strong>Digital Identity Management:</strong> Users control their own identity data, avoiding information leaks.</li>
        <li><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> Blockchain can record the creative process, protecting creators' rights.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Decentralized Social Structure</h3>
      <p>As blockchain applications deepen, the dominance of centralized institutions will be challenged, and society may become more decentralized.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO):</strong> Blockchain enables global users to make collective decisions without relying on centralized management.</li>
        <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Economy:</strong> Individuals can directly transact and collaborate without platform intermediaries.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Sovereignty:</strong> Users control their own data and can benefit from it.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Challenges and Limitations</h3>
      <p>Despite its promising prospects, blockchain development faces several challenges:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Many blockchain networks have bottlenecks in transaction processing speed and throughput.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Consumption:</strong> Some consensus mechanisms (e.g., PoW) are highly energy-intensive and difficult to sustain long-term.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory Issues:</strong> Different countries have varying attitudes toward blockchain, and the legal environment is not yet mature.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Awareness and Trust:</strong> Many people still lack understanding of blockchain principles and applications.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Future Outlook</h3>
      <p>In the future society, blockchain may become an indispensable technological foundation, driving a more equitable, transparent, and collaborative digital ecosystem. We need to continuously explore its application boundaries and overcome existing issues through technological iterations.</p>
      <p>The joint efforts of governments, businesses, developers, and the public will determine how blockchain truly drives social progress.</p>
