            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Food safety is not only the cornerstone of human health but also a core issue in global public health. As globalization deepens, the complexity of the food supply chain continues to increase, and food safety issues have transcended national boundaries, becoming a global challenge. The interplay of climate change, cross-border trade, and technological advancements makes it difficult for a single country or region to address this systemic issue. The introduction of blockchain technology provides new technological solutions for food safety, while cross-border collaboration and enhanced consumer awareness offer social and political safeguards for food safety governance. This article will explore how to build a new global food safety paradigm from three dimensions: technological empowerment, global collaboration, and food safety culture, to address the increasingly complex global challenges.</p>

            <h2>Blockchain Technology: Reconstructing the Foundation of Food Safety</h2>
            <h3>Core Advantages of Blockchain Technology</h3>
            <p>Blockchain technology, with its decentralization, immutability, and transparency, brings revolutionary changes to food supply chain management. Traditional centralized databases are vulnerable to attacks and tampering, while blockchain maintains data security and transparency through distributed nodes. Once data is written into the blockchain, it is almost impossible to alter, providing reliable data tracking for every step in the food supply chain.</p>
            <p>Smart contracts are another significant advantage of blockchain technology. They enable automated payments, quality inspections, and logistics management in the food supply chain, further enhancing efficiency and transparency. For example, Walmart's blockchain traceability system, in collaboration with IBM, can trace the origin of specific batches of vegetables within seconds, significantly reducing the time required for food recalls.</p>
            <h3>Case Studies</h3>
            <p>The application of blockchain technology in food safety has yielded significant results. Walmart's blockchain traceability system, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s "Foodborne Illness Tracking" project, and Denmark's COOP supermarket meat product tracking system all demonstrate the enormous potential of blockchain technology in improving transparency in the food supply chain and consumer confidence. These cases show that blockchain not only enhances the transparency of the food supply chain but also optimizes supply chain management through smart contracts and automated processes, reducing waste and costs.</p>
            <h3>Challenges and Prospects</h3>
            <p>Although blockchain technology shows great potential in food safety, its widespread application still faces challenges. Technical costs, adoption rates, and data privacy issues are the main obstacles. However, as the technology matures and costs decrease, blockchain is expected to be applied more broadly worldwide. In the future, blockchain technology will not only enhance the transparency of the food supply chain but also optimize supply chain management through smart contracts and automated processes, reducing waste and costs.</p>

            <h2>Global Collaboration: From Unilateral Action to Global Cooperation</h2>
            <h3>Common Challenges in Global Food Safety</h3>
            <p>Globalization has extended the food production and consumption chain across borders, and factors such as climate change, cross-border trade, and technological advancements have made food safety challenges increasingly complex. Climate change leads to more frequent extreme weather events, increasing the risk of supply chain disruptions. The expansion of cross-border food trade accelerates the spread of food contamination and pathogens. Emerging technologies such as gene editing and nanotechnology offer new ways to enhance food safety and nutritional value but also bring new regulatory and ethical challenges.</p>
            <h3>Importance of International Cooperation</h3>
            <p>In the face of these common challenges, international cooperation is particularly necessary. A single country's regulatory efforts are insufficient to cover the entire global supply chain or effectively address sudden cross-border food safety crises. The international community needs to establish a collaborative framework to achieve global and integrated food safety governance.</p>
            <h3>Limitations of Existing Governance Mechanisms</h3>
            <p>Although international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Codex Alimentarius Commission play significant roles in promoting global food safety, their decision-making processes are relatively slow and unable to respond to sudden food safety crises. Moreover, existing governance mechanisms focus more on post-crisis responses rather than preventive measures, leading to the spread and escalation of crises.</p>
            <h3>Recommendations for Building New Governance Mechanisms</h3>
            <p>To address current food safety challenges, the international community needs to establish a more inclusive and flexible cross-border food safety governance mechanism. Key paths include information sharing, establishing joint emergency response mechanisms, multiple stakeholder participation, and harmonizing food safety standards. Through these measures, the international community can achieve global and integrated food safety governance, ensuring that global consumers can enjoy safe and healthy food.</p>

            <h2>Food Safety Culture: From Dining Tables to Hearts</h2>
            <h3>Importance of Consumer Awareness</h3>
            <p>Consumers are not only the ultimate beneficiaries of food safety but also a crucial force in driving improvements. Enhancing consumer awareness of food safety can not only protect personal health but also drive improvements across the entire food supply chain. When consumers demand higher food safety standards, producers and operators will be compelled to raise their own standards to meet market demands.</p>
            <h3>The Essence of Food Safety Culture</h3>
            <p>Food safety culture refers to the totality of people's perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors towards food safety in a society. It encompasses the dissemination of food safety knowledge, the guidance of consumer behavior, and social oversight. By promoting food safety knowledge, guiding consumer behavior, and strengthening social oversight, a safer and healthier food consumption environment can be built.</p>
            <h3>International Experiences and Strategies for Cultivation</h3>
            <p>Japan's "Basic Food Safety Law" and the European Union's consumer protection policies showcase successful experiences in cultivating a food safety culture internationally. Through legal guarantees, strict food safety standards, and transparent information disclosure, these regions have enhanced public food safety awareness and fostered a positive food safety culture.</p>
            <p>Cultivating a food safety culture requires coordinated efforts from various sectors. Education, media advocacy, community activities, and active participation from governments and businesses are key strategies. Through these measures, the international community can create a safer and healthier food consumption environment, ensuring that everyone can enjoy safe and reliable food.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Food safety is a core issue in global public health, and its governance requires comprehensive participation from technological empowerment, global collaboration, and social culture. Blockchain technology, with its decentralization and immutability, brings unprecedented transparency and security to the global food supply chain. Global collaboration through international cooperation and coordinated governance addresses the complex challenges brought by globalization. Food safety culture, by enhancing consumer awareness and building social oversight mechanisms, drives bottom-up improvements in the food supply chain. The integration of these three elements will provide a comprehensive and sustainable solution for global food safety governance. The international community should strengthen cooperation to build a safer and healthier global food system, ensuring that everyone can enjoy safe and reliable food.</p>
