            <h2>Security Challenges in the Digital Wave</h2>
            <p>In today's world swept by the digital wave, cybersecurity threats are like stealthy viruses, constantly endangering the stability and security of the digital realm. The traditional single-point defense model is no longer sufficient to address the层出不穷 emerging threats. Security issues not only require technological innovation but also an upgrade in理念.</p>

            <h3>1. The Inspiration of Biological Immune Systems: From Reactive Defense to Proactive Immunity</h3>
            <p>Biological immune systems provide valuable insights for building a "proactive immunity" security ecosystem:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identification and Response:</strong> Biological immune systems can accurately identify and mark invading pathogens, initiating the corresponding immune response.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory and Learning:</strong> Biological immune systems can "remember" previously encountered pathogens and react swiftly upon encountering them again.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Evolution:</strong> Biological immune systems evolve continuously with environmental changes, enhancing resistance to new threats.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Addressing Human Vulnerabilities: From Technology-Driven to Human-Centric Security</h3>
            <p>In today's digital age, the essence of cybersecurity threats is the game between people. We need to pay more attention to human vulnerabilities and build a human-centered security system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Human Vulnerabilities:</strong> Curiosity, greed, and herd mentality are all targets exploited by attackers.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Patterns:</strong> People's responses to security prompts are often based on intuition rather than rational thinking.</li>
                <li><strong>Psychological Blind Spots:</strong> People tend to relax their guard in familiar scenarios.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>3. Breaking Industry Barriers: From Single-Point Defense to Eco-Collaboration</h3>
            <p>The systemic nature of cybersecurity threats requires us to break silos and achieve collaborative defense across industries and domains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Silos:</strong> Traditional security defense models lead to the formation of data silos, preventing information sharing and resource interoperability.</li>
                <li><strong>Fragmented Capabilities:</strong> Fragmented security capabilities prevent各方 from forming a united front, making it difficult to address complex cyber threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Trust Barriers:</strong> Trust barriers between industries hinder the flow of security information, resulting in lagging defense measures.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>4. A Smart, Humanistic, and Ecological Security Future</h3>
            <p>The future of the security industry will be a new paradigm that is smart, humanistic, and ecological:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intelligent Defense:</strong> Utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to achieve intelligent identification and defense against complex attack behaviors.</li>
                <li><strong>Humanistic Design:</strong> Through emotional design and personalized protection, users can enjoy the convenience of digitalization while feeling the power of security.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Collaboration:</strong> Breaking industry barriers to build a global security ecosystem, achieving collaborative and complementary security capabilities.</li>
            </ul>
