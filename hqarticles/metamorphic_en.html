            <h2>Connection of Metamorphic Rocks with Geological History</h2>
            <p>Metamorphic rocks reveal details of Earth's deep history through their mineral composition, structural changes, and isotopic data:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Continental Collision:</strong> For example, during the formation of the Himalayas, the banded structure of Gneiss records the direction of the stress field and the intensity of the metamorphic process.</li>
                <li><strong>Plate Movement:</strong> Serpentinite records the history of seafloor spreading, while Quartzite indicates processes of plate subduction and crustal thickening.</li>
                <li><strong>Supercontinent Cycle:</strong> By analyzing minerals in Schist, one can reconstruct the formation and breakup processes of supercontinents like Pangaea.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Applications of Metamorphic Rocks in Modern Technology and Industry</h2>
            <p>The properties of metamorphic rocks make them widely applicable in modern technology and industry:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mica:</strong> Its electrical insulation properties and heat resistance make it valuable in the electrical industry as an insulating material, for instance, in Apple devices for thermal insulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Graphite:</strong> Used as battery material and high-temperature lubricant, enhancing battery performance and lifespan, like in Tesla batteries.</li>
                <li><strong>Marble:</strong> Its aesthetic appeal and durability make it a high-end material for architectural decoration, such as at the Burj Al Arab in Dubai.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Metamorphic Rocks and Environmental Protection: Considerations for Sustainable Development</h2>
            <p>The extraction and use of metamorphic rocks have significant environmental impacts, but sustainable strategies can be employed:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA):</strong> Conduct a detailed assessment before mining to formulate mitigation measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Restoration:</strong> Implement landscape reshaping, soil remediation, and other recovery measures post-mining, utilizing the properties of metamorphic rocks for environmental restoration.</li>
                <li><strong>Using Metamorphic Rocks for Environmental Remediation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Soil Amendment: Dolomite and marble for neutralizing acidic soils.</li>
                        <li>Carbon Sequestration: Mineralization to convert carbon dioxide into carbonate minerals.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Metamorphic rocks are not only witnesses to Earth's geological history but also vital resources for modern technology, industry, and environmental protection. By deeply understanding the formation processes, characteristics, and industrial applications of metamorphic rocks, we can better utilize these natural resources while promoting sustainable environmental development. In the future, metamorphic rocks will continue to serve as a valuable resource, providing more possibilities for human societal development, achieving a win-win situation for technological innovation and ecological balance. Through scientific planning and innovative applications, metamorphic rocks will continue to play a unique role in the advancement of human civilization.</p>
