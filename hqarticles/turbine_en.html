            <h2>Hydro Turbines and Ecology: From Game Theory to Symbiosis in Green Development</h2>
            <p>Hydropower, as a cornerstone of clean energy, plays a crucial role in global energy transition. Hydro turbines, as the core equipment of hydropower generation, directly affect the efficiency of water energy utilization. However, with the deepening of ecological civilization construction, the relationship between hydro turbines and the ecological environment is undergoing a profound transformation from "game theory" to "symbiosis." How to achieve harmonious coexistence with ecosystems while ensuring energy security has become a critical challenge on the path of green development for hydro turbines.</p>

            <h3>I. The Interaction Between Hydro Turbines and Ecosystems</h3>
            <p>The relationship between hydro turbines and ecosystems is characterized by significant complexity, with potential negative effects as well as new opportunities for ecological restoration. This duality requires us to examine the relationship between hydro turbines and ecology with a systemic perspective.</p>
            <h4>1. Potential Impacts of Hydro Turbines on Ecosystems</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Changes in Hydrological Regime</strong>  
                    <p>The operation of hydro turbines significantly alters the natural hydrological characteristics of rivers. According to research by the International Hydropower Association (IHA), the construction of hydroelectric plants can reduce river flow velocity by 40%-60%, which directly affects the self-purification capacity, sediment transport, and bank stability of rivers. For example, after the construction of a hydroelectric plant in the lower reaches of the Jinsha River, the annual sediment transport of the lower reaches decreased by about 75%, leading to increased riverbed incision.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Threats to Biodiversity</strong>  
                    <p>The impacts of hydro turbines on aquatic organisms mainly manifest in two aspects: one is physical barrier effects, especially on migratory fish; the other is habitat fragmentation. For instance, in the Yangtze River Basin, the natural breeding population of Chinese sturgeon has decreased from over 10,000 in the 1970s to less than 100 currently, with the blocking effect of hydroelectric plants being one of the important reasons.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Weakening of Ecosystem Services</strong>  
                    <p>The construction of hydroelectric plants changes the continuity of rivers, affecting the material cycling and energy flow of ecosystems. Studies have shown that the construction of hydroelectric plants can reduce the value of river ecosystem services by 15%-30%, mainly reflected in the weakening of functions such as water quality purification and climate regulation.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Ecological Restoration Potential of Hydro Turbines</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application of Ecological Dispatch Technology</strong>  
                    <p>Through scientific ecological dispatch, hydro turbines can become an important tool for regulating river ecological flow. For example, the Three Gorges Reservoir, through the implementation of ecological dispatch experiments, created suitable breeding conditions for the four major fish species in 2022, with the monitoring of egg-laying scale increasing about threefold compared to before the dispatch.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Benefits of New Hydro Turbine Technology</strong>  
                    <p>The development of fish-friendly hydro turbine technology provides new solutions for reducing aquatic organism injuries. The new hydro turbine developed by the US Alden Laboratory can achieve a fish survival rate of over 98%, far higher than the 80%-90% of traditional hydro turbines.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Synergistic Effects of Ecological Restoration</strong>  
                    <p>The stable flow conditions generated by hydro turbine operation can provide favorable conditions for the restoration of aquatic vegetation and the reconstruction of benthic communities. For example, the Rhone River Basin in France successfully restored over 200 kilometers of river ecological corridors through hydro turbine regulation.</p>
