            <h2>Qigong: The Revival of Traditional Wisdom in Modern Society and Future Prospects</h2>
            <p>Qigong, a life philosophy system originating from ancient China, encapsulates thousands of years of profound understanding of human life mysteries and precise grasp of natural laws by sages. Its core concept lies in the regulation and application of "Qi" to achieve harmony and health of the mind and body. In the context of rapid modern societal development, Qigong, though ancient, does not appear outdated due to its "traditional" identity. Instead, it has gained new vitality through deep integration with modern medicine and technology, as well as its dissemination in global cultural exchanges. This article will explore the integration of Qigong with modern medicine, the fusion of Qigong with technology, and the role of global cultural exchanges in shaping the future of Qigong.</p>
