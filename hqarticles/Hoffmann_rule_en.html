            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hoffmann's Rule, a classic theory in organic chemistry, was initially proposed by Roald Hoffmann to explain and predict the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of organic reactions. However, with the rapid development of molecular orbital theory and computational chemistry, the scope and depth of this rule have been unprecedentedly expanded and deepened. This article will re-examine the modern significance of Hoffmann's Rule from the perspectives of molecular orbital theory, computational chemistry, and organic synthesis, and demonstrate its wide-ranging applications in modern chemical research.</p>

            <h3>Classical Interpretation of Hoffmann's Rule and the Introduction of Molecular Orbital Theory</h3>
            <p>Hoffmann's Rule was initially based on ligand field theory and valence bond theory, primarily used to explain the reactivity of transition metal complexes. The classical theory posits that the electronic and steric effects of ligands collectively determine the selectivity of reactions. Specifically, ligands with stronger electron-donating abilities tend to favor reactions in their electron-donating direction, while ligands with larger steric hindrance tend to favor reactions in directions with less steric hindrance.</p>
            <p>With the advancement of quantum chemistry, molecular orbital theory has gradually become the core tool for explaining the mechanisms of chemical reactions. Molecular orbital theory posits that the essence of chemical reactions is the reorganization and overlap of molecular orbitals, and the selectivity of reactions depends on the symmetry and energy matching of molecular orbitals. Introducing molecular orbital theory into the study of Hoffmann's Rule not only deepens the understanding of the essence of reactions but also provides more precise tools for predicting reaction selectivity.</p>

            <h3>New Interpretation of Hoffmann's Rule from the Perspective of Molecular Orbital Theory</h3>
            <p>From the perspective of molecular orbital theory, Hoffmann's Rule can be reinterpreted as the influence of the symmetry and energy matching of molecular orbitals on reaction selectivity. Specifically, the selectivity of reactions depends on the symmetry matching between the molecular orbitals of the reactants and the transition state, as well as the energy matching between the molecular orbitals of the reactants and the products.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Symmetry Matching</strong>: The selectivity of reactions first depends on the symmetry matching between the molecular orbitals of the reactants and the transition state. If the molecular orbitals of the reactants and the transition state have the same or similar symmetry, the reaction is more likely to occur. This point resonates with the electronic effects of ligands in the classical Hoffmann's Rule, but molecular orbital theory provides a more precise description of symmetry matching.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Matching</strong>: The energy matching between the molecular orbitals of the reactants and the products is also a crucial factor in determining reaction selectivity. If the molecular orbitals of the reactants and the products have similar energies, the reaction is more likely to occur. This point resonates with the steric effects of ligands in the classical Hoffmann's Rule, but molecular orbital theory provides a more precise description of energy matching.</li>

For example, in transition metal-catalyzed coupling reactions, by selecting appropriate ligands and reaction conditions, we can control the symmetry matching between the molecular orbitals of the reactants and the transition state, thereby achieving control over the regioselectivity of the reaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Band Design in Photoelectric Materials</strong>: In the design of photoelectric materials, by controlling the matching between the molecular orbitals of the material and the photon energy, we can optimize the photoelectric performance of the material. For example, by designing organic semiconductor materials with specific molecular orbital symmetries, we can improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency and conductivity of the material.</li>
                <li><strong>Targeted Selectivity in Drug Design</strong>: In drug design, by analyzing the interactions between drug molecules and target proteins using molecular orbital theory, we can achieve precise control over the targeted selectivity of drugs. For example, by designing drug molecules with specific molecular orbital symmetries, we can improve the binding affinity of drugs with target proteins, thereby enhancing the efficacy of the drugs.</li>
                <li><strong>Reaction Mechanism Studies in Environmental Chemistry</strong>: In environmental chemistry, by using computational chemistry methods, we can study the reaction mechanisms and degradation mechanisms of chemical pollutants, thereby developing effective pollutant treatment methods. For example, by using computational chemistry methods, we can study the molecular orbitals and electron density distribution of pollutant molecules, thereby developing effective pollutant treatment methods.</li>
