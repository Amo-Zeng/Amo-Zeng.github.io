            <p>In the vast expanse of the universe, interstellar gas is not only the fundamental material for the formation of stars and planets but also an important medium for recording cosmic history. These gases not only contain the material components of the early universe but also record various events in the evolution of the cosmos. From this perspective, interstellar gas acts like a massive "time capsule," preserving fragments of cosmic history. By studying these gases, scientists can trace the state of the universe billions of years ago and understand how the universe evolved from its initial simple elements into complex structures. Additionally, the discovery of complex organic molecules in interstellar gas provides new clues for exploring the origin of life.</p>

            <h3>1. Origin and Composition of Interstellar Gas</h3>
            <p>Interstellar gas is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, the lightest elements produced during the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. In the early universe, these gases existed in an extremely diffuse state in space. Over time, these gases gradually accumulated to form the first generation of stars. Nuclear fusion reactions within stars produced heavier elements such as carbon, oxygen, and iron. When these stars exhausted their fuel and eventually exploded as supernovae, these heavy elements were ejected into the interstellar medium, further enriching the composition of interstellar gas.</p>

            <h3>2. Supernova Explosions and the Distribution of Heavy Elements</h3>
            <p>Supernova explosions are among the most spectacular events in the universe, marking the end of a star's life and having a profound impact on the interstellar medium. Supernova explosions release heavy elements synthesized within the star into interstellar space. The distribution and abundance of these elements can provide important information about the star's life cycle and the chemical evolution of the galaxy. For example, by analyzing the abundance ratios of different elements in interstellar gas, scientists can infer the contributions of different types of supernova explosions to the interstellar medium. Type Ia supernovae primarily produce heavy elements like iron, while core-collapse supernovae produce more intermediate-mass elements such as oxygen and silicon. This information helps us understand the evolution of stars and the chemical composition of the galaxy.</p>

            <h3>3. Molecular Clouds in Interstellar Gas and Star Formation</h3>
            <p>Molecular clouds in interstellar gas are the cradles of star formation. These molecular clouds are typically composed of hydrogen molecules (H₂) and other molecules, with densities much higher than the surrounding interstellar medium. Inside these molecular clouds, the temperature and density conditions are suitable for the gas cloud to gradually contract and form new stars. By studying the properties of molecular clouds, scientists can understand the mechanisms of star formation and the patterns of star distribution in the galaxy.</p>

            <h3>4. Chemical Evolution of Interstellar Gas</h3>
            <p>The chemical evolution of interstellar gas is a complex process involving various physical and chemical mechanisms. For example, interstellar dust grains can adsorb gas molecules, forming complex organic molecules. The distribution and evolution of these organic molecules in the interstellar medium are crucial for understanding the origin of life. Additionally, chemical reactions in interstellar gas are influenced by cosmic rays, ultraviolet radiation, and magnetic fields, which collectively shape the chemical properties of the interstellar medium.</p>

            <h3>5. Organic Molecules in Interstellar Gas and the Origin of Life</h3>
            <p>In recent years, astronomers have discovered an increasing number of complex organic molecules in interstellar gas. The presence of these molecules not only reveals the complexity of cosmic chemistry but also raises new questions about the origin of life. Organic molecules found in interstellar gas, such as methanol (CH₃OH), formaldehyde (CH₂O), ethanol (C₂H₅OH), and even more complex molecules like amino acids and sugars, indicate that rich organic chemical reactions occur in interstellar space. These reactions may form complex organic molecules under extreme cosmic conditions.</p>
            <p>The foundation of life chemistry is organic molecules, especially those that can participate in biochemical reactions. On Earth, the basic units of life are cells, which are composed of organic molecules such as amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, and sugars. These molecules not only contribute to the structure and function of cells but are also the basis for the transmission of genetic information and energy metabolism. Organic molecules found in interstellar gas, such as methanol, formaldehyde, and ethanol, are precursors to more complex organic molecules. For example, methanol can further react to form formaldehyde, which can then react with ammonia to form amino acids. These reactions have been verified in laboratory settings, indicating that under appropriate conditions, simple organic molecules in interstellar gas can gradually synthesize more complex organic molecules, which may be the foundation of life chemistry.</p>

            <h3>6. Interstellar Organic Molecules and the Origin of Life on Earth</h3>
            <p>There are many theories about the origin of life on Earth, one of the more popular being the "exogenous theory," which suggests that life on Earth originated from outer space. This theory posits that organic molecules on Earth may have been brought to the planet through the impact of comets or meteorites. Comets and meteorites are rich in organic molecules, which may have been released upon impact, providing the necessary chemical substances for the early origin of life on Earth. In recent years, scientists have discovered various organic molecules in comets and meteorites, including amino acids, sugars, and nucleic acid bases. These findings further support the "exogenous theory." For example, in 2016, the European Space Agency's "Rosetta" mission...</p>
