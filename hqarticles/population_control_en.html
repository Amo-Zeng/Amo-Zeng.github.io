            <h2>Technology and Population Planning</h2>
            <p>The rapid development of technology has presented us with unprecedented opportunities. Through big data analysis, we can predict the urbanization process in India, forecasting that its urban population will increase to 600 million by 2030. The application of artificial intelligence also makes population census and data analysis more accurate, such as China's "Sky Eye" system, which can monitor and analyze population movements in real time.</p>

            <h2>Potential and Challenges of Gene Editing Technology</h2>
            <p>The advancement of gene editing technologies, such as the application of CRISPR-Cas9, although still in its infancy, may play a significant role in the prevention of genetic diseases and population health management in the long term. However, we must also face ethical, privacy, and technical challenges during this process to ensure that technological progress serves human welfare.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Diversity and Fertility Concepts</h2>
            <p>The fertility concepts within cultural diversity present a rich and varied picture globally. In some regions of Africa, influenced by traditional观念, the fertility rate remains high. In some developed countries, such as Japan and South Korea, the fertility rate continues to decline due to economic pressures and cultural changes.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>International Cooperation and Population Control</h2>
            <p>International cooperation projects are an effective way to promote the globalization of population control ideologies. For example, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) promotes gender equality and child welfare globally, and by establishing a transnational cooperation network, countries can share experiences and integrate resources in areas such as fertility policies, gender equality, and child welfare.</p>

            <h2>Environmental Carrying Capacity and Sustainability</h2>
            <p>The exponential expansion of population growth has imposed unprecedented pressure on the Earth's environmental carrying capacity. By promoting renewable energy, improving resource efficiency, and developing circular economy solutions that are environmentally friendly, we can not only alleviate environmental pressures but also provide environmentally friendly solutions for population control.</p>
