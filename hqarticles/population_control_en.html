                <li><strong>Improving the healthcare system to enhance population health levels:</strong> Health is an important component of population quality. Strengthening the public health system, improving the healthcare service system, ensuring accessibility and fairness of medical services, reducing disease burden, and extending healthy lifespans lay the foundation for improving population quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship to invigorate society:</strong> Innovation is a crucial engine for improving population quality. Creating a favorable environment for innovation and entrepreneurship, encouraging talent mobility, and stimulating innovation and entrepreneurship across society inject new momentum for improving population quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting balanced population development and optimizing the population structure:</strong> While improving population quality, it is also essential to optimize the population structure. Encouraging childbirth, improving the elderly care service system, promoting coordinated urban-rural population development, and building a reasonable population structure.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>"Quality improvement" in population management is a profound conceptual change and a systematic project. It requires the joint efforts of the government, businesses, social organizations, and every citizen. By transforming development concepts, improving policy systems, and increasing investment, we can build a new population development framework that aligns with high-quality development and achieve sustainable development of the population and the environment.</p>
