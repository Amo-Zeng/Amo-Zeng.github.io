            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the process of globalization, factors such as the digital economy, green transformation, and geopolitics are increasingly significant in influencing the global economy and regional economic integration. As an important form of regional economic integration, the formation and development of customs unions are inevitably deeply influenced by these factors. This article will explore the challenges and opportunities faced by customs unions from the perspectives of the digital economy, green transformation, and geopolitics, analyze the cooperation and competitive relationships of customs unions in different fields, discuss the roles and strategies of customs unions in addressing global governance challenges, and propose possible paths and challenges for customs unions in promoting regional economic integration and sustainable development.</p>

            <h3>Impact of Digital Economy, Green Transformation, and Geopolitics on Global and Regional Economic Integration</h3>
            <p>The digital economy has greatly promoted global economic growth by facilitating cross-border data flows, enhancing production efficiency, and fostering innovation. However, the development of the digital economy has also brought about new inequalities, known as the "digital divide." Within customs unions, there are significant differences in the level of digital economic development among member states, which not only affects the economic growth potential of individual countries but also poses challenges to the overall competitiveness of the customs union.</p>
            <p>Green transformation, by promoting the development of clean energy, low-carbon technologies, and circular economies, not only helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change but also optimizes and upgrades economic structures, enhancing the quality and efficiency of economic growth. For member states of customs unions, green transformation is not only a necessary means to address environmental challenges but also an important way to enhance regional economic competitiveness.</p>
            <p>Geopolitical factors, by influencing international relations, trade policies, and investment environments, have a profound impact on global and regional economic integration. Particularly within customs unions, geopolitical factors can lead to conflicts of interest and policy disagreements among member states, affecting the stability and development of customs unions. For example, political conflicts and instability in the Middle East have influenced the formation and development of customs unions in the region. Additionally, great power rivalries can also affect the formation and development of customs unions. For instance, the trade war and geopolitical competition between the United States and China have influenced the formation and development of customs unions in the Asia-Pacific region. Great power rivalries can exert external pressures on policy choices of customs union member states, affecting the stability and development of customs unions.</p>

            <h3>Cooperation and Competition Relationships of Customs Unions in the Digital Economy, Green Transformation, and Geopolitical Fields</h3>
            <p>The cooperation and competition relationships among member states of customs unions in the digital economy, green transformation, and geopolitical fields are complex and ever-changing. In the digital economy field, member states need to cooperate to formulate unified digital service trade rules to promote the healthy development of the digital economy within the region. For example, the European Union has established the Digital Single Market Strategy to eliminate digital barriers among member states and promote the free flow of digital services. At the same time, competition in the digital economy field among member states is also intensifying. Countries are actively implementing policies to attract investment and innovation in the digital economy field to enhance their digital economic competitiveness. For example, competition between Germany and France in areas such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing is particularly intense, which not only drives the digital economic development of their respective countries but also has a profound impact on the overall competitiveness of the customs union.</p>
            <p>In the green transformation field, customs unions have positively promoted the green transformation of member states through policy coordination and unified environmental standards. Firstly, customs unions can formulate unified environmental policies and standards to promote cooperation among member states in environmental protection and sustainable development. For example, the European Union has established the European Green Deal to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, promoting cooperation among member states in energy transition, circular economy, and green technology innovation. Secondly, customs unions can incentivize member states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote green transformation through market mechanisms such as carbon emission trading. For example, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is the largest carbon market in the world, promoting the reduction of carbon emissions among member states and enterprises through market mechanisms and fostering the development of clean energy and low-carbon technologies. However, conflicts of interest among member states cannot be ignored. Differences in economic development levels and industrial structures may lead to disagreements among member states on green transformation goals and paths. For example, some member states may have significant interests in traditional energy industries, while others may be more inclined to develop clean energy and low-carbon technologies, which may lead to difficulties in policy coordination. Additionally, the economic costs and transformation pressures brought about by green transformation may also lead to conflicts of interest among member states. For example, some member states may face significant economic transformation pressures and need to bear higher green transformation costs, while others may gain economic competitive advantages through green transformation, which may lead to imbalances and conflicts among member states.</p>
            <p>In the geopolitical field, customs unions play an important role in the geopolitical landscape. Firstly, customs unions can coordinate the positions of member states to safeguard their interests in geopolitical games. For example, the European Union coordinates the positions of member states to safeguard their interests in geopolitical games and balance relations with major powers outside the region. Secondly, customs unions can enhance the competitiveness of member states in geopolitical games by formulating unified policies and standards. For example, the European Union has enhanced the competitiveness of member states in geopolitical games by formulating unified foreign and security policies. The establishment and development of customs unions have a significant impact on regional geopolitical landscapes. Firstly, the establishment of customs unions may change regional geopolitical landscapes. For example, the establishment and development of the European Union have changed the geopolitical landscape of Europe and enhanced Europe's influence in international affairs. Secondly, the development of customs unions may affect regional security and stability. For example, the development of customs unions in the Asia-Pacific region may affect the security and stability of the region, leading to geopolitical competition and conflicts.</p>

            <h3>Roles and Strategies of Customs Unions in Addressing Global Governance Challenges</h3>
            <p>Facing complex challenges in global digital economy governance, climate change, and geopolitics, customs unions need to play a positive role in promoting sustainable development among member states and participating in global governance. Firstly, customs unions should coordinate the positions of member states and actively participate in the formulation of global digital trade rules. For example, the European Union actively promotes the formulation of digital trade rules under the WTO framework to safeguard the interests of member states. Secondly, customs unions should promote digital economic cooperation among member states and narrow the "digital divide" by formulating unified policies and standards. For example, the European Union has enhanced the overall level of digital economic development by promoting the interconnection of digital infrastructure among member states. Finally, customs unions should strengthen cooperation with countries outside the region to jointly address the challenges of global digital economy governance. For example, the cooperation between the European Union and the United States, Japan, and other countries in the digital economy field helps to promote the formulation and implementation of global digital trade rules.</p>
            <p>In addressing the challenges of global climate change, customs unions need to play a positive role in promoting green transformation among member states and participating in global climate governance. Firstly, customs unions should coordinate the positions of member states and actively participate in global climate governance to promote the realization of the goals of the Paris Agreement. For example, the European Union actively promotes global climate governance at international climate conferences such as COP26, proposing a series of emission reduction targets and action plans. Secondly, customs unions should promote green economic cooperation among member states and facilitate the cross-border flow of green technologies and clean energy by formulating unified policies and standards. For example, the European Union has enhanced the overall level of green economic development by promoting cooperation among member states in green technologies and clean energy. Finally, customs unions should strengthen cooperation with countries outside the region to jointly address the challenges of global climate change. For example, the cooperation between the European Union and the United States, China, and other countries in the field of climate change helps to promote global climate governance and green transformation.</p>
            <p>In the geopolitical field, customs unions need to play a positive role in promoting sustainable development among member states and participating in global governance. Firstly, customs unions should coordinate the positions of member states to safeguard their interests in geopolitical games. For example, the European Union coordinates the positions of member states to safeguard their interests in geopolitical games and balance relations with major powers outside the region. Secondly, customs unions can enhance the competitiveness of member states in geopolitical games by formulating unified policies and standards. For example, the European Union has enhanced the competitiveness of member states in geopolitical games by formulating unified foreign and security policies. Finally, customs unions should actively participate in shaping regional geopolitical landscapes, promoting regional security and stability to safeguard the interests of member states and the sustainable development of the regional economy.</p>
