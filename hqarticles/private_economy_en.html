            <p>Constructing a healthy and vibrant innovation ecosystem is key to the continuous prosperity of the private economy. Firstly, nurturing an innovative culture is the foundation of the innovation ecosystem. Businesses must create an environment that encourages exploration and tolerates failure to stimulate employees' creativity and innovative potential. Secondly, talent strategies are crucial. Private enterprises should collaborate with universities and research institutions, as well as establish continuous learning and training systems internally, to build a robust innovation team. Additionally, seamless integration of technology with the market, support and guidance from capital markets, and policy environment and institutional safeguards together form a multidimensional support system for the private economy's innovation ecosystem.</p>

Management innovation is crucial for ensuring the efficient operation of the enterprise. Private enterprises need to introduce modern corporate systems, optimize their governance structures to enhance management efficiency and decision-making quality.

Corporate social responsibility is also an indispensable part of long-term development. Private enterprises should take on environmental protection and social harmony responsibilities, giving back to society through practical actions and enhancing their brand image and social influence.</p>
