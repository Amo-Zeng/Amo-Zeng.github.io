            <p>As fingertips glide across electronic screens, a new form of prose is quietly emerging—it is neither purely human nor entirely technological; neither absolutely resistant nor completely submissive; it narrates human stories while also conveying the whispers of microbial communities and oak trees. The contemporary nature of prose resides precisely in this ambiguous zone of dissolving boundaries, becoming a medium through which we re-anchor ourselves amidst the multiple困境 (dilemmas) of technological reorganization, traffic alienation, and ecological collapse.</p>

                <h3>I. Technological Dimension: The Phenomenology of the Cyborg Body</h3>
                <p>The body is no longer a purely biological existence. Pacemakers conduct the rhythm of the heart, smartphones extend memory, and algorithms silently map desires. This hybridization is not a future illusion but a present reality. Prose is undertaking the mission of recording this hybrid experience—it captures the sense of rupture between the coldness of fingertips touching glass screens and the dopamine warmth triggered by like notifications; it writes about the suspended anxiety between mechanical alerts and bodily fear when health apps suddenly issue warnings.</p>
                <p>This kind of writing is neither a praise of technology nor a curse upon it, but rather a phenomenological close observation. It reveals how we perceive the world anew through technological interfaces: GPS navigation reshapes the meaning of "being lost," beauty filters reconstruct the boundaries of "the face." Prose becomes the archivist of new forms of experience, searching for yet unnamed feelings within the symbiotic缝隙 (interstices) of human and machine. As Heidegger said, "Technology is a mode of revealing," and prose is recording the new state of existence under this revelation.</p>

                <h3>II. Media Dimension: Silent Resistance under the Logic of Traffic</h3>
                <p>Under the tyranny of the attention economy, prose has unexpectedly become a faint voice resisting homogenization. It refuses to be simplified into clickbait or emotional stimuli, insisting on using迂回的 (circuitous) syntax, complex speculation, and subtle emotions to combat the cognitive flattening brought about by algorithm recommendations.</p>
