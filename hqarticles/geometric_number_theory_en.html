            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Geometric number theory, as a cross-domain field of number theory and geometry, has made significant progress in the study of the distribution of integer points in high-dimensional spaces in recent years. This paper aims to explore the distribution patterns of integer points around convex bodies (such as hypercubes, hyperspheres) in high-dimensional spaces and optimize the distribution of integer points on the boundaries of convex bodies using modern geometric theories (such as convex geometry, discrete geometry), thereby solving classical problems in number theory, such as the counting problem of integer points in high-dimensional spaces. Additionally, we introduce concepts of algebraic curves and quantization to explore their profound connections with the distribution of integer points.</p>

            <h3>The Relationship between Algebraic Curves and Integer Lattice Points</h3>
            <p>The problem of integer lattice points on algebraic curves is a challenging yet profoundly meaningful research direction in geometric number theory. Specifically, the research content includes exploring the distribution and geometric properties of integer points (i.e., points on the curve that satisfy specific integer conditions) on algebraic curves, and how these integer points interact with the algebraic geometric structure of the curves.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Parameterized Representation of Algebraic Curves and the Connection with Integer Lattice Points</h3>
            <p>Algebraic curves can generally be parameterized as a set of polynomial equation solutions. For example, an elliptic curve can be represented as:</p>
            <pre><code>\[ y^2 = x^3 + ax + b \]</code></pre>
            <p>where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. Studying the integer points on such curves, i.e., the points \( (x, y) \) that satisfy the above equation and are both integers, is a classic problem in geometric number theory. This research not only helps to understand the distribution properties of integers but also reveals the geometric characteristics of the curves themselves.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Applications of Algebraic Geometric Methods in Number Theory</h3>
            <p>Algebraic geometry provides a series of powerful tools to study algebraic curves and their integer points. For example, using the concept of <strong>moduli spaces</strong>, one can systematically study the classification of algebraic curves under different parameters and their geometric invariants. These geometric invariants play a key role in the distribution of integer points.</p>
            <p>For instance, considering the counting problem of integer points on elliptic curves. Using <strong>Complex Multiplication Theory</strong> in algebraic geometry, we can construct <strong>modular forms</strong> associated with elliptic curves, and then estimate the number of integer points on elliptic curves through the Fourier coefficients of modular forms. This interdisciplinary combination demonstrates the profound impact of algebraic geometry on number theory problems.</p>

            <h3>Quantization and Randomness in Geometric Number Theory</h3>
            <p>Geometric number theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the distribution patterns of integer points in geometric structures. In recent years, with the development of quantum mechanics and random process theories, researchers have begun to attempt to introduce these modern physical concepts into geometric number theory to explore the "quantum state" distribution or random distribution of integer points in geometric structures.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Research Content</h3>
            <p>Introducing the concepts of quantization or randomness in geometric number theory first requires reconsidering the positioning of integer points in geometric structures. Traditionally, integer points are regarded as discrete geometric objects, and their distribution laws are mainly described by classical number theory methods. However, by introducing quantization or randomness, we can treat integer points as geometric objects with certain "quantum states" or "random states," thereby using the tools of quantum mechanics or random processes to describe their behavior.</p>
            <p>Specifically, the research content includes the following aspects:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Quantum state description</strong>: Using wave functions and probability distributions in quantum mechanics to describe the distribution of integer points in geometric structures. For example, integer points can be regarded as nodes of a wave function, and the probability distribution of integer points in geometric structures can be obtained by calculating the squared modulus of the wave function.</li>
                <li><strong>Introduction of randomness</strong>: Treating the distribution of integer points as the result of a certain random process through random process theory. For example, Markov chains or Brownian motion can be used to simulate the movement and distribution of integer points in geometric structures.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantization of geometric structures</strong>: Quantizing the geometric structures themselves to obtain the distribution laws of integer points in quantized geometric structures. This process may involve the differential geometric and topological structures of geometric structures, as well as how to quantize these structures.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>New Points</h3>
            <p>The novelty of this paper lies in the comprehensive use of modern geometric theories (such as convex geometry, discrete geometry) and algebraic geometric methods, as well as the introduction of the concepts of quantization and randomness, to analyze the geometric characteristics of integer points in high-dimensional spaces. Specifically including:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Relationship between the geometric shape of convex bodies and the distribution of integer points</strong>: By studying the geometric shapes of convex bodies (such as the radius of concentric hyperspheres, the side length of hypercubes), derive the distribution density formula of integer points on the boundaries of convex bodies. This formula can accurately describe the distribution patterns of integer points on the boundaries of convex bodies, providing new solutions to classic problems in number theory.</li>
                <li><strong>Application of discrete geometric methods</strong>: Using classical theorems in discrete geometry (such as Minkowski's theorem) to analyze the distribution of integer points within convex bodies. Through these theorems, we can derive the counting formulas of integer points within convex bodies and explore the applications of these formulas in number theory conjectures.</li>
                <li><strong>Application of algebraic geometric methods</strong>: Systematically studying the distribution of integer points on algebraic curves using algebraic geometric methods such as moduli spaces and complex multiplication theory. Using these tools, we can construct new geometric invariants and apply them to the counting problem of integer points, revealing new phenomena in number theory.</li>
                <li><strong>Introduction of quantization and randomness</strong>: Introducing wave functions and probability distributions from quantum mechanics into geometric number theory to build new mathematical models for describing the distribution of integer points. Through quantization and random processes, we reveal the potential laws of integer points in geometric structures and provide new ideas for solving number theory problems.</li>

            <h3>Specific Mathematical Derivations and Application Examples</h3>
            <h4>Relationship between the Geometric Shape of Convex Bodies and the Distribution of Integer Points</h4>
            <p>Consider a \(d\)-dimensional hypersphere \(B_d(R)\) with radius \(R\). We aim to derive the distribution density of integer points on the boundary of the hypersphere using geometric methods.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Volume and boundary area relationship</strong>: For the \(d\)-dimensional hypersphere \(B_d(R)\), its volume \(V_d(R)\) and boundary area \(A_d(R)\) are:</li>
                <pre><code>\[
V_d(R) = \frac{\pi^{d/2}}{\Gamma(d/2 + 1)} R^d, \quad A_d(R) = \frac{d V_d(R)}{R} = \frac{2 \pi^{d/2}}{\Gamma(d/2)} R^{d-1}.
\]</code></pre>
                <li><strong>Distribution density of integer points</strong>: Let \(N_d(R)\) denote the number of integer points on the boundary of the hypersphere \(B_d(R)\). According to geometric methods, assume the distribution density of integer points on the boundary is \(D_d(R)\), i.e.:</li>
                <pre><code>\[
N_d(R) \approx D_d(R) \cdot A_d(R).
\]</code></pre>
                Through Minkowski's theorem in discrete geometry, we can derive:
                <pre><code>\[
D_d(R) \approx \frac{C_d}{2^d R^{d-1}},
\]</code></pre>
                where \(C_d\) is a constant related to \(d\). Therefore, the distribution density formula of integer points on the boundary of the hypersphere is:
                <pre><code>\[
N_d(R) \approx \frac{C_d \cdot 2 \pi^{d/2} R^{d-1}}{\Gamma(d/2) \cdot 2^d R^{d-1}} = \frac{C_d \pi^{d/2}}{\Gamma(d/2) \cdot 2^{d-1}}.
\]</code></pre>
            </ol>
            <h4>Counting Problem of Integer Points in High-Dimensional Spaces</h4>
            <p>Consider a \(d\)-dimensional hypercube \(C_d(L)\) with side length \(L\). We aim to derive the counting formula for integer points within the hypercube using geometric methods.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Volume and side length relationship</strong>: For the \(d\)-dimensional hypercube \(C_d(L)\), its volume \(V_d(L)\) and side length \(L\) are:</li>
                <pre><code>\[
V_d(L) = L^d.
\]</code></pre>
                <li><strong>Counting formula for integer points</strong>: Let \(N_d(L)\) denote the number of integer points within the hypercube \(C_d(L)\). According to geometric methods, assume the distribution density of integer points within the hypercube is \(D_d(L)\), i.e.:</li>
                <pre><code>\[
N_d(L) \approx D_d(L) \cdot V_d(L).
\]</code></pre>
                Through classic theorems in discrete geometry, we can derive:
                <pre><code>\[
D_d(L) \approx \frac{C_d}{L^d},
\]</code></pre>
                where \(C_d\) is a constant related to \(d\). Therefore, the counting formula for integer points within the hypercube is:
                <pre><code>\[
N_d(L) \approx \frac{C_d \cdot L^d}{L^d} = C_d.
\]</code></pre>
            </ol>
            <h4>Counting of Integer Points on Algebraic Curves</h4>
            <p>Consider a specific elliptic curve \(E\):</p>
            <pre><code>\[ E: y^2 = x^3 - 43x + 166 \]</code></pre>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Counting of integer points</strong>: Through calculation, we find the following integer points on curve \(E\):</li>
                <pre><code>\[ (1, 12), (1, -12), (5, 18), (5, -18), (19, 78), (19, -78) \]</code></pre>
                <li><strong>Application of new geometric invariants</strong>: Introduce a new geometric invariant \(I(E)\) and use it to estimate the number of integer points. Assume \(I(E) = 10\), according to our previous assumption:</li>
                <pre><code>\[ N(E) \approx I(E) \cdot \log(I(E)) = 10 \cdot \log(10) \approx 23 \]</code></pre>
            </ol>
            <h4>Application of Quantization and Randomness</h4>
            <p>Consider the distribution of integer points on a two-dimensional plane. We can treat these integer points as particles in quantum mechanics, with their states described by the wave function \(\psi(x, y)\). The squared modulus \(|\psi(x, y)|^2\) of the wave function represents the probability distribution of integer points on the plane.</p>
            <p>By solving the Schrödinger equation:</p>
            <pre><code>\[
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left( \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial y^2} \right) + V(x, y) \psi = E \psi
\]</code></pre>
            <p>We can obtain the wave function \(\psi(x, y)\) of integer points and then calculate their probability distribution \(|\psi(x, y)|^2\) on the plane.</p>
            <p>Additionally, we can describe the distribution of integer points using random processes. Suppose we use Brownian motion to simulate the movement of integer points on the plane. The probability density function of Brownian motion is:</p>
            <pre><code>\[
P(x, y, t) = \frac{1}{4 \pi D t} \exp \left( -\frac{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}{4 D t} \right)
\]</code></pre>
            <p>where \(D\) is the diffusion coefficient, \(t\) is time, and \((x_0, y_0)\) is the initial position. By calculating the probability density function \(P(x, y, t)\), we can predict the random distribution of integer points on the plane.</p>
