            <h2>Technological Innovation Leading a New Civilizational Paradigm</h2>
            <p>The progress of human civilization has always been accompanied by technological innovation. From the roar of steam engines to the rise of smart factories, from the golden age of precision manufacturing to breakthroughs in nanotechnology, innovations have not only reshaped our means of production but have also deeply changed the relationship between humans and nature. At this pivotal moment in history, we are undergoing a profound transformation—from a micro-scale technological revolution to macro-level ecological renewal. This is not only a revolution in science and technology but also a reconfiguration of civilization itself.</p>

            <h3>I. Micro Revolution: Technological Leap from "Micron" to "Nano"</h3>
            <p>Technological innovation is the core driving force behind the advancement of human civilization. From the precision manufacturing of the "micron age" to the material revolution of the "nano age," innovation continuously pushes the boundaries of our understanding and ushers in a new era of technological development.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Micron-scale manufacturing:</strong> Enabled the prosperity of the information society; transistors in integrated circuits shrank from micrometer to nanometer scales, increasing computing speed while reducing energy consumption.</li>
                <li><strong>Nano-scale technology:</strong> Has opened a new chapter in material science, enabling breakthrough applications in fields such as high-strength materials, precision medicine, and environmental management.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Manufacturing Transformation: Reconstructing the Paradigm from "Traditional Manufacturing" to "Future Technologies"</h3>
            <p>The transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing sector is a crucial part of this technological revolution. The shift from "traditional manufacturing" to "future technologies" is not just a technological iteration, but a fundamental change in production methods, organizational structures, and modes of value creation.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Challenges of traditional manufacturing:</strong> Efficiency bottlenecks, cost pressures, and lack of innovation.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological evolution to future industries:</strong> Smart manufacturing, flexible manufacturing, green manufacturing, and service-oriented manufacturing.</li>
            </ol>
