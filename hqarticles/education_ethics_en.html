            <h2>Modern Challenges in Educational Ethics</h2>
            <p>With the rapid advancement of technology, the field of education is undergoing unprecedented transformation. The widespread application of big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and virtual reality (VR) not only offers new possibilities for personalized learning and educational equity but also introduces complex ethical challenges. This article will explore the core issues of educational ethics in modern society from three dimensions: data-driven education, AI and education, and online education in the post-pandemic era, proposing possible solutions.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Data-Driven Education: The Dilemma of Privacy and Personalization</h3>
            <p>The application of big data technology enables educational institutions to provide personalized learning recommendations and resources by analyzing students' learning data. However, this personalized learning model hides profound privacy and ethical issues.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Ownership and Informed Consent:</strong> Does students' learning data belong to the students themselves, or to the educational institutions? Is the principle of informed consent adequately guaranteed? These questions directly relate to students' privacy rights and data security.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Security and Transparent Usage:</strong> Do educational institutions have sufficient technical means to protect students' data from being leaked or misused? Transparent and responsible data usage norms are crucial.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>AI and Education: Algorithm Fairness and the Reconstruction of the Teacher's Role</h3>
            <p>The application of artificial intelligence in education, while offering new possibilities for personalized learning and educational equity, also brings ethical challenges such as algorithmic bias, the transformation of the teacher's role, and educational fairness.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic Bias and Fairness:</strong> Due to unbalanced datasets or unconscious bias among developers, AI educational products may exhibit bias towards specific genders, races, or regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Transformation of the Teacher's Role:</strong> In the age of AI, the role of teachers is increasingly shifting towards that of learning facilitators and emotional supporters, raising issues of professional development and rights protection for teachers.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Education in the Post-Pandemic Era: The Ethical Boundaries of Virtual and Reality</h3>
            <p>The outbreak of the pandemic has fundamentally changed the global educational landscape, with online education experiencing unprecedented development in a short period. However, this rapid development has also brought a series of ethical issues, such as teacher-student relationships in virtual spaces, cyberbullying, and the digital divide.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Teacher-Student Relationships and Campus Culture in Virtual Spaces:</strong> In the online education environment, the relationship between teachers and students has significantly changed, necessitating the active construction of a healthy virtual campus culture by educational institutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Cyberbullying and Academic Misconduct:</strong> In the online education environment, issues such as cyberbullying and academic misconduct become more complex and covert.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Future Prospects: The Continuous Evolution of Educational Ethics</h3>
            <p>As technology continues to advance and educational needs diversify, educational ethics will face new challenges and opportunities. Future educational institutions need to make continuous efforts in the following areas:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Synchronization of Technological Updates and Ethical Education:</strong> Educational institutions should closely monitor the development of new technologies, update educational ethics norms in a timely manner, and strengthen the ethical education of teachers and students.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Institutional Cooperation and Standardization:</strong> Educational institutions should enhance cooperation with other institutions to promote the formulation of educational standards, ensuring the secure circulation of educational technologies across different platforms and systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Establishment of Ethical Review Mechanisms:</strong> Educational institutions can establish internal ethical review mechanisms to regularly evaluate the effectiveness and impact of educational technologies, adjusting and optimizing policies accordingly.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Educational ethics in modern society face complex and multifaceted challenges. By clarifying data ownership, establishing data usage norms, and setting up data security protection mechanisms, it is possible to maximize data value while ensuring privacy, promoting educational equity and personalized development. In the era of AI, educational institutions need to ensure the fairness and transparency of algorithm design, support the professional development and rights protection of teachers, and adopt comprehensive measures to promote educational equity, safeguarding students' rights and fairness. In the post-pandemic era, educational institutions need to build a healthy virtual campus culture, establish corresponding norms and measures, and adopt comprehensive measures to promote educational equity, providing students with safer, more efficient, and fairer educational services. The core values of educational ethics need to be re-examined and upheld. Only by achieving balance in both technological and ethical dimensions can the true potential of education be realized, cultivating independent, free, and creative individuals.</p>
