            <h2>The Narrative Revolution in the Digital Age: A Threefold Transformation of Power Restructuring and Ethical Boundaries</h2>
            <p>Amid the triple transformations where Generative AI blurs creative boundaries, interactive films subvert audience roles, and streaming algorithms reshape cultural power, a profound narrative revolution has arrived. These seemingly independent phenomena collectively reveal the core proposition of cultural production in the digital age: <strong>When technology dismantles traditional narrative power structures, how do we rebuild the order of creative ethics, responsibility distribution, and cultural ecology?</strong></p>
        </section>

            <h3>I. The Deconstruction of Narrative Power: From Author Sovereignty to Distributed Control</h3>
            
            <h4>1.1 AI Creation: The Legitimacy Crisis of Non-Human Agency</h4>
            <p>Generative AI is deconstructing the traditional foundations of the "author" concept. When AI independently produces scripts meeting originality requirements, the "anthropocentric" principle of the copyright system faces fundamental challenges. This impact far exceeds the "mechanical reproduction" debates of Benjamin's era – it undermines not just reproduction technology but the ontological status of the creative subject.</p>
            
            <h4>1.2 Interactive Films: The Algorithmic Dissolution of Authorial Authority</h4>
            <p>Audience choice breaks down the director's "authority" into probabilistic branching paths. Truffaut's advocated "auteur theory" faces reconstruction here: when narrative control is jointly assumed by algorithmic frameworks and user operations, work sovereignty exhibits distributed characteristics.</p>
            
            <h4>1.3 Cultural Hegemony: From Geopolitics to Algorithmic Colonialism</h4>
            <p>Netflix's recommendation systems are reshaping global cultural power dynamics. Data shows that overseas series undergo an average 17% content adjustment to adapt to global markets. This "algorithmic disciplining" creates new forms of cultural hybridization, replacing traditional geographic cultural hegemony with more covert <strong>techno-cultural colonization</strong>.</p>

            <h3>II. The Evolution of Responsibility Ethics: Deconstructing Three Frontier Issues</h3>
            
            <h4>2.1 The Quantum State Dilemma of AI Copyright: Ownership and Ontological Challenges</h4>
            <p>AI creation pushes copyright ownership into a superpositioned state: training data providers, algorithm developers, and end-users may all claim rights. The 2023 US Copyright Office ruling (protecting only works with "substantial human involvement") exposes existing system limitations. A deeper crisis lies in the absence of <strong>digital personality rights</strong> – when deceased individuals' "digital avatars" continue starring in new films, ontological debates about the continuity of personality urgently require legislative response (e.g., Japan's proposed "Digital Personality Rights Act").</p>
            
            <h4>2.2 Distributed Responsibility in Interactive Narratives: From Viewing to Complicity</h4>
            <p>Works like "Bandersnatch" (Black Mirror) construct a tripartite responsibility network involving audience-creator-platform:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creators</strong> must set ethical thresholds (e.g., prohibiting extreme violence options)</li>
                <li><strong>Platforms</strong> must provide decision-tracking mechanisms (e.g., Amazon's "Choice History")</li>
                <li><strong>Audiences</strong> must bear emotional responsibility ("Late Shift" players experiencing guilt over wrong choices)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This new topology necessitates establishing a <strong>narrative social contract</strong> that transcends traditional film ethics frameworks.</p>
            
            <h4>2.3 The Dynamic Balance of Cultural Power: Algorithmic Hegemony and Hybrid Resistance</h4>
            <p>Global streaming platforms are rewriting the logic of cultural power. Netflix's localization of "Squid Game" confirms García Canclini's "hybrid cultures" theory: Mexican directors leverage platforms to export Aztec mythology, simultaneously resisting Hollywood hegemony while being constrained by platform algorithms. This interplay reveals the <strong>duality</strong> of cultural exchange—empowerment and discipline coexist.</p>

            <h3>III. Order Reconstruction: Integrated Governance Pathways</h3>
            
            <h4>3.1 Reconfiguring Creative Rights: Contribution Quantification Models</h4>
            <p>Establish dynamic rights distribution systems evaluating three dimensions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data contribution value</strong> (via blockchain traceability)</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithm innovation degree</strong> (patent weight assessment)</li>
                <li><strong>Human creative density</strong> (verified creation logs)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Reference: UK's AI copyright proposal for "adjustable royalty models"</em></p>
            
            <h4>3.2 Interactive Ethics Design: Responsibility Distribution Mechanisms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ethical tier systems</strong> (extending PEGI ratings to narrative decision sensitivity)</li>
                <li><strong>Consequence visualization tools</strong> (e.g., moral impact indicators)</li>
                <li><strong>Safety valve mechanisms</strong> (cognitive buffers for extreme choices)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>3.3 Cultural Diversity Infrastructure: Algorithmic Democratization Practices</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Cultural carbon offsetting" systems</strong>: Proportionate platform funding for marginalized cultural creation</li>
                <li><strong>Diversity algorithm metrics</strong> (UNESCO Culture Indicators Framework 2.0)</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-cultural collaboration platforms</strong> (enhancing the World Digital Library as narrative co-creation space)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion: Toward a Future of Narrative Ecology</h3>
            <p>When Habermas's theory of communicative action is projected onto the digital narrative domain, the ideal ecology should involve synergistic evolution between <strong>technological systems, ethical frameworks, and cultural ecologies</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>AI expanding creative boundaries as new narrative participants</li>
                <li>Audiences rebuilding agency as co-responsible stakeholders</li>
                <li>Cultural differences transforming into creative resource pools</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Benjamin's prophecy of "democratization through mechanical reproduction" is recurring—this power metamorphosis may herald a golden age for narrative art, contingent on developing <strong>ethical infrastructure and institutional intelligence</strong> aligned with the new paradigm.</p>
