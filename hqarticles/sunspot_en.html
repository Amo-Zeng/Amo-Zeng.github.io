            <h2>Multilayered Impacts of Sunspots: From Internal Dynamics to Earth's Climate and Space Environment</h2>
            <p>Sunspots, a prominent indicator of solar activity, not only affect the Sun itself but also extend their influence to Earth's climate system and space environment, creating a series of complex and multilayered interactions.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Traditional studies on sunspots mainly focus on their numbers and periodicity, but with advancements in observation technology and numerical simulation techniques, scientists are beginning to explore the deeper mechanisms of their influence, including connections to solar internal dynamics, driving forces on climate change, and their shaping of solar wind and the Earth's space environment.</p>
