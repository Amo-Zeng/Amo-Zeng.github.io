            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Mechanical dynamics is undergoing a paradigm shift from ideal linear models to complex real-world systems, encompassing two interrelated frontiers: in-depth research on chaotic behavior in nonlinear systems and innovative design of bio-inspired mechanical systems. By integrating nonlinear dynamics theory with bionic principles, this paper proposes a novel research framework for mechanical systemsâ€”combining motion strategies evolved over millions of years in nature with complex nonlinear phenomena in engineering systems, providing a theoretical foundation and technical pathway for the design of next-generation intelligent mechanical systems. We systematically analyze methods for identifying and controlling nonlinear chaos, explore the dynamic essence of biological motion strategies, and reveal the synergistic effects of these approaches in enhancing system adaptability, energy efficiency, and robustness. Through case studies (e.g., the integration of nonlinear energy sinks with snake robots, the fusion of chaos control and flapping wing optimization), we demonstrate the immense potential of this interdisciplinary field, pointing the way for the intelligent and adaptive development of future mechanical systems.</p>

            <h2>1. Fusion of Nonlinearity and Bionics: A New Paradigm in Mechanical Dynamics</h2>
            
            <h3>1.1 From Linear to Nonlinear: The Complexity Leap in Mechanical Systems</h3>
            <p>Traditional mechanical dynamics is based on linear models, but nonlinear factors in real systems (friction, gaps, nonlinear stiffness, etc.) often lead to behaviors that exceed linear predictions, resulting in bifurcations, limit cycle oscillations, and even chaos. These characteristics were once seen as obstacles in engineering design, but recent research shows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chaotic behavior can enhance system sensitivity to weak signals (e.g., high-precision sensors)</li>
                <li>Nonlinear stiffness enables wide-band energy transfer (e.g., NES technology)</li>
                <li>Bifurcation phenomena provide a physical basis for multimodal motion</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 From Mechanical to Biological: Insights from Nature's Dynamics</h3>
            <p>Biological systems have developed unique nonlinear dynamic strategies under evolutionary pressure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Redundant degrees of freedom</strong> (e.g., hundreds of vertebrae in snakes) enable motion flexibility through nonlinear coupling</li>
                <li><strong>Muscle-tendon systems</strong> exhibit intelligent regulation of nonlinear stiffness and damping</li>
                <li><strong>Neural control</strong> utilizes chaotic dynamics to enhance environmental adaptability</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The fusion of these concepts creates the new field of "bio-inspired nonlinear dynamics," with the core question: <strong>How can we engineer the nonlinear strategies that biological systems use to cope with complex environments?</strong></p>

            <h2>2. Dialogue Between Chaos and Life: Cross-Scale Analysis of Nonlinear Phenomena</h2>
            
            <h3>2.1 Chaotic Behavior in Biological Systems</h3>
            <p>Research reveals that controlled chaos is prevalent in biological motion:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chaotic wing beats in insect flight improve wind resistance stability</li>
                <li>Bifurcation phenomena in human gait enable walking-running transitions</li>
                <li>Vortex shedding in fish tail fins exhibits spatiotemporal chaotic patterns</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These phenomena indicate: <strong>Chaos is not noise to be eliminated but a dynamic resource for biological intelligence.</strong></p>

            <h3>2.2 Bio-Inspired Control of Engineering Chaos</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Stabilize chaotic attractors through small-amplitude parameter modulation</li>
                        <li>Application case: Vibration suppression in chaotic rotor bearings</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Phase space reconstruction control</strong> (similar to cerebellar motor learning)
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adjust control forces in real-time based on Lyapunov exponents</li>
                        <li>Enable self-recovery in bio-inspired robots</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The framework of nonlinearity and bionics fusion proposed in this paper marks a new stage in mechanical dynamics research. By deciphering the wisdom of biological systems in harnessing complex nonlinearity and translating it into engineering design principles, we are pushing the theoretical limits of traditional mechanical systems. In the future, with the deep integration of artificial intelligence, new materials, and nonlinear dynamics, a new generation of mechanical systems with life-like characteristics will redefine the relationship between humans and machines. This transformation will not only drive technological progress but also deepen our understanding of the philosophical proposition that "life is essentially a nonlinear dynamic process."</p>
