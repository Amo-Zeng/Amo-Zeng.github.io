            <h2>Bio-Inspired and AI Integration: The Future Path of Sonar Signal Processing</h2>
            <p>Sonar technology, as a core means of underwater detection and communication, plays an indispensable role in marine resource exploration, underwater target identification, environmental monitoring, and military defense. However, traditional sonar systems often face challenges such as inefficiency and weak anti-interference capabilities in complex underwater environments. In recent years, with the rapid development of biotechnology and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, leveraging the sonar systems of natural organisms and combining them with AI technologies like deep learning and reinforcement learning to develop more efficient and intelligent sonar signal processing algorithms has become a highly promising research direction.</p>
