            <h2>2. Applications of Sonar Signal Processing in Underwater Cultural Heritage Preservation</h2>
            <h3>Basic Principles of Sonar Technology</h3>
            <p>Sonar (Sound Navigation and Ranging) technology works by emitting sound waves into the water and receiving their echoes, allowing for the detection and imaging of underwater objects. The core of this technology lies in the propagation characteristics of sound waves in water: when sound waves travel through water, they reflect, scatter, or refract when they encounter objects of different density or hardness (such as shipwrecks or rocks). These echo signals are received by sonar devices and processed to generate images or data.</p>
            <p>High-resolution sonar imaging technologies (such as multibeam sonar and side-scan sonar) can generate high-precision seabed topographic maps with resolutions down to the centimeter level. This feature gives it a significant advantage in the detection of underwater cultural heritage. Compared to traditional diving exploration, sonar technology can quickly and extensively scan the seabed without contacting the site, significantly improving the efficiency of site discovery.</p>
            <h3>Case Studies of Site Detection</h3>
            <p>The application of sonar technology in underwater cultural heritage detection has achieved many successful cases. For example, in 2009, a multinational archaeological team discovered a 9,000-year-old ancient shipwreck site in the Black Sea. This discovery was made possible by high-resolution sonar imaging technology, which could clearly capture the outline and structural details of the shipwreck. Additionally, sonar technology is widely used in the detection of shipwreck sites in the Mediterranean and Red Sea, helping archaeologists discover many historically significant shipwrecks and ancient relics.</p>
            <p>Through sonar signal processing, archaeologists can not only determine the location of the site but also preliminarily judge the age, structural characteristics, and preservation status of the site. For example, the unique texture of certain wooden structures in sonar images provides important clues for archaeologists, aiding further research and preservation efforts.</p>
            <h3>High-Precision Recording of Sonar Imaging</h3>
            <p>Sonar imaging technology not only helps in the discovery of sites but also provides detailed records of underwater cultural heritage. By processing sonar signals, high-precision seabed topographic maps can be generated, recording the exact location, shape, and structure of the site. This recording method has significant scientific value, especially in deep-sea environments where traditional diving exploration is often difficult. Sonar technology provides valuable data support for archaeologists.</p>
            <p>For example, side-scan sonar can generate high-resolution images of the seabed, showing surface features of the site, such as the outline of shipwrecks and the foundation structures of buildings. Multibeam sonar can generate three-dimensional seabed topographic maps, providing archaeologists with more intuitive structural information about the site. This data can be used for academic research and as a reference for subsequent protection work, ensuring the effective preservation of cultural heritage.</p>
            <h3>Monitoring the Preservation Status of Cultural Heritage</h3>
            <p>Monitoring the preservation status of cultural heritage is an important part of protection efforts. Sonar technology can monitor changes in the preservation status of sites by regularly scanning the area. For example, sonar images can show the corrosion of wooden structures on shipwrecks and geological changes around the site. This information provides scientific evidence for assessing the impact of natural erosion or human destruction.</p>
            <p>In some cases, sonar technology can also detect abnormal activities around the site, such as illegal salvage or seabed mining, providing early warnings for the protection of cultural heritage. Through sonar signal processing, protection personnel can monitor the dynamic changes of the site in real-time and take appropriate measures to ensure the effective protection of cultural heritage.</p>
