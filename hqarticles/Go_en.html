            <h2>Application of Go Language in Modern Distributed Systems: From Microservices to Edge Computing and WebAssembly</h2>
            <p>In today's technological landscape, Go language stands out for its unique concurrency model, concise syntax, and efficient runtime characteristics, making it an ideal choice for building modern distributed systems. This article explores how Go language excels in microservices architecture, event-driven systems, edge computing, and WebAssembly (Wasm) applications.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>I. Implementation of Microservices Architecture</h3>
            <p>Microservices architecture enhances system flexibility and scalability by breaking down applications into multiple small, independently deployable services. Go language excels in this area:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lightweight goroutines:</strong> Go's goroutines make creating concurrent tasks easy, suitable for service discovery, load balancing, and request handling. For example, service registration and discovery can be implemented with goroutines:</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>func registerService() {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(30 * time.Second)
    defer ticker.Stop()
    for range ticker.C {
        // Register service with the service registry
        if err := consul.RegisterService("service-name", "127.0.0.1", 8080); err != nil {
            log.Printf("Failed to register service: %v", err)
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inter-service communication:</strong> Go's <code>net/rpc</code> package provides a simple and efficient way for inter-service communication. Combined with goroutines, it enables non-blocking RPC calls, enhancing system responsiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>Dependency injection and configuration management:</strong> Utilizing Go's interfaces and structures, dependency injection can be easily implemented, simplifying service configuration and management.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>II. Building Event-Driven Systems</h3>
            <p>Event-driven architecture (EDA) facilitates asynchronous communication between systems through an event publish-subscribe mechanism. Go's channels and select statements provide natural support for this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Event publishing and subscribing:</strong> Channels can be used for event publishing and subscribing:</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>type Event struct {
    Type string
    Data interface{}
}

var events = make(chan Event)

func Publish(e Event) {
    select {
    case events <- e:
    default:
        // Handle case where buffer is full
        log.Println("Event channel is full, event discarded")
    }
}

func Subscribe(handler func(Event)) {
    for {
        select {
        case e := <-events:
            go handler(e)
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Concurrent processing:</strong> Go's goroutines allow each event handler to run independently, enhancing system concurrency and scalability.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>III. Optimization in Edge Computing</h3>
            <p>With the advancement of IoT and 5G technologies, edge computing has become crucial. Go language performs well in resource-constrained environments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fast compilation:</strong> Go's quick compilation feature makes it suitable for edge devices requiring frequent updates, reducing deployment time.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory management:</strong> Using mechanisms like <code>sync.Pool</code> can effectively manage memory, reducing the pressure of garbage collection and enhancing performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time data processing:</strong> Go can integrate with stream processing frameworks like Apache Kafka to handle real-time data streams, reducing network bandwidth needs and improving response times.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>IV. Integration with WebAssembly</h3>
            <p>The possibility of compiling Go into Wasm opens up new chapters in running high-performance Go code in browsers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Code sharing:</strong> Server-side and client-side can share the same Go code, reducing duplicate work and network communication.</li>
                <li><strong>High-performance components:</strong> With Go's efficient concurrency model, high-performance web frontend components can be developed, such as real-time data updates or complex user interface interactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Security and efficiency:</strong> Go's static typing and memory safety features make it more advantageous than JavaScript when handling sensitive data or compute-intensive tasks.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The application of Go language in modern distributed systems goes beyond its concurrency capabilities, including innovative applications in microservices architecture, event-driven systems, edge computing, and WebAssembly. By leveraging these features, developers can build more flexible, reliable, and efficient systems from the cloud to the edge, from server to client, showcasing Go's powerful adaptability and potential. As technology evolves, the application of Go in these areas will continue to expand, driving software development towards more efficient, responsive directions.</p>
