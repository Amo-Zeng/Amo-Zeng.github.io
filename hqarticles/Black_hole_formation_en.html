            <h2>Hyperspace Universe of Black Holes: From Quantum Entanglement to the Reshaping of Consciousness Information Fields</h2>
            <p>Black holes, one of the most mysterious celestial bodies in the universe, have long captivated the exploration of scientists and philosophers alike. Traditional theories of black hole formation primarily focus on gravitational collapse. However, with the advancements in quantum mechanics and cosmology, we now have more tools and perspectives to re-examine this phenomenon. This article synthesizes concepts such as quantum entanglement, antimatter, dimensional bending, parallel universes, and consciousness and information fields to propose a new hypothesis on the formation of black holes. The aim is to reveal that black holes are not just the end of matter, but also the hub of cosmic information and higher forms of consciousness.</p>

            <h3>Quantum Entanglement and Antimatter: Information Channels Across the Universe</h3>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is a core concept in quantum mechanics, describing a special correlation between two or more particles. Even when they are far apart, a change in the state of one particle immediately affects the state of the other. Could this instantaneous non-local correlation phenomenon play a role in the early stages of black hole formation?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quantum Entanglement Triggers Mirror Black Holes:</strong> Suppose that at the moment of the Big Bang, some matter and energy existed in the form of quantum entangled states. These entangled particles span across space, correlating with each other. When an extreme gravitational collapse occurs in a certain region of the universe, these entangled particles may transmit some information to the other end of the universe, forming a "mirror black hole".</li>
                <li><strong>Role of Antimatter:</strong> Could it be hypothesized that the formation of black holes is not just the collapse of matter, but the product of the mutual annihilation of matter and antimatter? In this process, the enormous energy release may be transmitted deep into the universe in the form of high-energy rays or gravitational waves.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Dimensional Bending and Parallel Universes: Folding Spots in Higher Dimensions</h3>
            <p>Breaking free from the traditional three-dimensional space thinking, we can re-examine the formation of black holes from a higher-dimensional perspective. In a higher-dimensional space, black holes might be understood as "folding spots" of higher-dimensional space in the three-dimensional universe.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Projection of Higher-Dimensional Space:</strong> Black holes are points projected from higher-dimensional space into the three-dimensional universe. The singularity inside them may be a bridge to higher-dimensional space.</li>
                <li><strong>Passage to Parallel Universes:</strong> When matter is swallowed by a black hole, does it have the possibility of entering another parallel universe, like passing through a mirror into a mirrored world?</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Consciousness and Information Fields: The Intelligence Hub of the Universe</h3>
            <p>Moving beyond the material world, we can redefine the formation of black holes from the perspective of consciousness and information. Black holes might not only be the products of material collapse but also the hubs of cosmic information fields.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Storage and Processing of Information:</strong> Black holes store and process a large amount of information since the birth of the universe. When matter is swallowed by a black hole, it does not disappear, but rather transforms into information, stored in the black hole's information database.</li>
                <li><strong>Higher Forms of Consciousness:</strong> Could black holes create an information field independent of the material world, giving birth to higher forms of intelligent life?</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>By introducing new perspectives such as quantum entanglement and antimatter, dimensional bending and parallel universes, and consciousness and information fields, we propose a new hypothesis on the formation of black holes. Future research should integrate more interdisciplinary thinking, examining the essence of the universe from a broader perspective, and revealing the deeper mysteries behind black holes.</p>
