            <h2>The Pritzker Prize: Reflection and Beyond the Halo</h2>
            <p>As the highest honor in the architectural world, the Pritzker Prize, established in 1979, has not only witnessed the flourishing development of global architectural art but has also subtly shaped the aesthetic standards and creative directions of contemporary architecture. However, behind the halo of this prestigious award, there lurks the prejudiced influence of Western centrism, the lure of commercialization, and the complex interplay between artistic value and the award mechanism. This article attempts to adopt a more critical perspective to delve into the role and impact of the Pritzker Prize in the context of globalization and commercialization. It also explores how to seek a balance between artistic ideals and real-world interests, thereby providing new insights for the diverse development of architectural art.</p>

            <h3>Questioning Western Centrism: The Cultural Hegemony Behind the Awards</h3>
            <p>The name of the Pritzker Prize itself carries a strong Western flavor, which is not merely a superficial phenomenon but also reflects the underlying Western centrism in the award's selection criteria and value orientation. This tendency is particularly evident in the selection criteria, jury composition, and distribution of winners, mirroring the unbalanced global architectural discourse.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Selection Criteria:</strong> Emphasis on innovation, technicality, and visual impact, while neglecting the natural harmony, community involvement, and historical heritage of non-Western architectural traditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Jury Composition:</strong> Dominance of Western jurors limits diverse cultural perspectives, increasing the risk of cultural bias and aesthetic barriers for non-Western architectural works.</li>
                <li><strong>Distribution of Winners:</strong> Most winners come from Europe, America, and Japan, with few architects from Africa, Latin America, and other regions of Asia, reflecting the inequality in global architectural discourse.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Myth of "Awardability": The Alienation and Reconstruction of Artistic Value</h3>
            <p>The selection criteria of the Pritzker Prize not only shape contemporary architectural aesthetic directions but also define the characteristics of "awardability." These characteristics include visual impact, technological innovation, and social significance. They are both products of the award mechanism and guides for architectural creation. However, this guidance is not always positive and may alienate the essence of architectural art.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Visual Impact:</strong> The pursuit of landmark buildings may lead to a neglect of functionality and practicality, disrupting the harmony between architecture and the environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Innovation:</strong> Excessive emphasis on technology may result in architectural works losing cultural内涵 and humanistic concern.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Significance:</strong> Functionality overshadowing artistry undermines the unique value of architecture as an art form, potentially reducing architecture to a mere appendage of policy.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The Double-Edged Sword of Commercialization: The Struggle Between Artistic Ideal and Real-World Interests</h3>
            <p>The Pritzker Prize is not only an honor but also a powerful commercial tool. Winning architects often become market darlings, receiving widespread attention for their works and reaping commercial rewards. However, this commercialization trend may have profound effects on architectural creation itself, potentially leading to significant negative consequences.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Commercialization Risks:</strong> Homogenized design approaches and styles, neglecting diversity and innovation, result in architectural works losing their unique artistic value.</li>
                <li><strong>Limitations on Creative Freedom:</strong> Under immense market pressure, architects may abandon challenging but more artistically valuable designs, opting for safer options.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Beyond the Pritzker Prize: A Diverse Future for Architectural Art</h3>
            <p>In an era of intertwined globalization and commercialization, the Pritzker Prize is both an achievement to be proud of and a phenomenon that requires continuous reflection. By questioning Western centrism, critically thinking about "awardability," and delving into the impact of commercialization, we can not only gain a clearer understanding of the limitations of this award but also provide new perspectives for the diverse development of architectural art.</p>
            <p>The true value of architectural art lies not in the halo of awards or commercial success, but in whether it can create beautiful living spaces for humanity and whether it can embody cultural diversity and progressive times. In this sense, the value of the Pritzker Prize does not lie in what it is, but in how we interpret it, reflect on it, and ultimately transcend it.</p>
