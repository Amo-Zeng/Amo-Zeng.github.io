            <h2>Population Optimization: Reshaping the Future Society in Three Dimensions</h2>
            <p>Population optimization, a complex issue, is often oversimplified to fertility rates, aging populations, and adjustments in the labor market. However, when viewed from a broader perspective, its implications far exceed these surface-level indicators. This article will explore the multi-dimensional aspects of population optimization from three novel angles: "Internal Locus of Control," the digital divide and intergenerational differences, and environmental carrying capacity. The aim is to provide new thinking paths for building a more balanced, harmonious, and sustainable future society.</p>

            <h3>1. Internal Locus of Control: Reconstructing Demographic Dividends from Individual Well-being</h3>
            <p>The traditional concept of "demographic dividends" often focuses on the direct contribution of increased labor force to economic growth, neglecting the deeper impacts of demographic changes on individual well-being and social vitality. From the perspective of internal locus of control, we may redefine demographic dividends by connecting them closely with individual well-being and social vitality.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Demographic Changes and Internal Locus of Control:</strong> Trends such as population aging and fewer children are reshaping social structures, with different age groups facing distinct challenges. Younger generations seek self-realization in a fiercely competitive job market, while older groups may feel lonely and powerless due to decreased social participation. Policymakers need to consider how to enhance the internal locus of control of younger generations through education and vocational training, making them more competitive in a rapidly changing society. Additionally, how can more social participation opportunities be created for older groups to enhance their sense of control over life?</li>
                <li><strong>Policy Orientation and Social Vitality:</strong> Government policies play a crucial role in enhancing individual internal locus of control. For example, providing high-quality education and vocational training helps individuals develop skills and increase competitiveness; establishing a more inclusive social security system reduces the pressure on people of all age groups and enhances their well-being. Through these measures, the vitality of all age groups in society can be stimulated, forming a virtuous cycle.</li>
                <li><strong>New Indicators of Well-being:</strong> Focusing solely on economic growth indicators is insufficient to comprehensively measure the outcomes of population optimization. We need to develop new indicator systems that include factors such as individual well-being, social participation, and mental health to more comprehensively evaluate the impact of demographic changes on society.</li>

            <h3>2. Digital Divide and Intergenerational Differences: Bridging New Challenges in Digital Age Population Optimization</h3>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technology, like a double-edged sword, brings unprecedented convenience and opportunities to society while also exposing deep-seated digital divides, posing new challenges on the path of population optimization. This challenge is not limited to technical mastery and application but also touches the core of societyâ€”intergenerational differences and the resulting social inequalities.</p>
