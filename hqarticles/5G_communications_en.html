            <h3>The Deep Integration of 5G and Virtual Reality: Transforming Entertainment and Social Experiences</h3>
            <p>Under the support of 5G networks, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies are profoundly transforming entertainment and social interactions. Traditional forms of entertainment, such as movie theaters and game arcades, require users to physically visit specific locations, while VR entertainment in the 5G era breaks this limitation. Users only need to wear a VR headset to immerse themselves in movie scenes or participate in complex multiplayer online games. The low latency of 5G ensures that actions in the virtual world can be reflected in real time, greatly enhancing immersion and interactivity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Immersive Entertainment Experiences:</strong> Future VR movies can offer real-time interaction, where the audience's choices directly affect the development of the plot, completely revolutionizing traditional viewing modes.</li>
                <li><strong>Virtual Social Platforms:</strong> Through 5G-supported VR social platforms, users can communicate "face-to-face" with friends from around the world and even participate in activities within the virtual reality space, such as virtual travel or virtual meetings.</li>
            </ul>
