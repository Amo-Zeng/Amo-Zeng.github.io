            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Ultraviolet Spectroscopy (UV Spectroscopy) is a pivotal analytical technique in modern scientific research, known for its high sensitivity and non-destructive nature. By accurately measuring the absorption, emission, and reflection characteristics within the 100-400 nanometer range of the electromagnetic spectrum, UV spectroscopy provides unique and in-depth molecular insights for interdisciplinary research. This article aims to systematically explore the multi-dimensional applications and scientific value of UV spectroscopy in fields such as chemistry, biology, and materials science.</p>

            <h3>Precise Quantitation and Structural Analysis in Chemical Analysis</h3>
            <h4>1.1 Spectral Fingerprint of Molecular Structure</h4>
            <p>In chemical analysis, UV spectroscopy, based on the principles of molecular electronic transitions, provides a unique "fingerprint" for substances. The absorption peaks at specific wavelengths reflect the electronic transition characteristics of molecular orbitals, making UV spectroscopy a powerful tool for structural identification.</p>
            <p>For example, conjugated olefins and aromatic compounds typically exhibit characteristic absorption peaks in the 200-300 nm range. Through precise measurements of these absorption peaks, one can obtain:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Energy levels of molecular electronic transitions (calculated via Woodward-Fieser rules)</li>
                <li>Length of the conjugated system (analyzed via Kasha's Rule)</li>
                <li>Polarity and spatial configuration of molecules (through solvent effects and red or blue shifts)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Data Support:</strong> Studies show that benzene has an absorption peak at 254 nm, while adding conjugated double bonds shifts the peak towards longer wavelengths, with styrene's peak at 282 nm.</p>
            
            <h4>1.2 Applications in Environmental and Pharmaceutical Analysis</h4>
            <p>In environmental monitoring, UV spectroscopy's sensitivity can reach nanograms per liter (ng/L), allowing for the precise detection of trace organic pollutants. Organic substances like phenols and pesticide residues in water can be quickly identified and quantified by their unique UV absorption spectra.</p>
            <p>Pharmaceutical analysis also benefits from UV spectroscopy. By measuring the UV absorption spectrum of drugs, one can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Assess drug purity (>99.5%, calculated via the Lambert-Beer law)</li>
                <li>Detect impurities and degradation products (through peak separation and colorimetric analysis)</li>
                <li>Conduct pharmacokinetic studies (via dynamic changes in absorption peaks)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Data Support:</strong> For instance, Methotrexate has an absorption peak at 257 nm, with its degradation products appearing near 300 nm during stability testing.</p>
