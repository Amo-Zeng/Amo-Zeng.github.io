            <h3>Organic Farming and Biodiversity</h3>
            <p><strong>Impact of Organic Farming on Soil Composition</strong><br>
            Organic farming significantly increases the organic matter content in the soil by using natural substances like compost, green manure, and animal manure. This organic matter not only enhances the structure and function of the soil but also promotes the diversity of soil microbes.</p>
            <p><strong>How Organic Farming Attracts Wildlife and Insects</strong><br>
            Through practices like crop rotation, intercropping, and avoiding synthetic chemicals, organic farming creates richer habitats for wildlife and insects. Diverse crop planting attracts more pollinators like bees and butterflies, while providing food and shelter for birds, mammals, and beneficial insects.</p>
            <p><strong>Empirical Studies on the Long-term Effects of Organic Agriculture on Ecosystems</strong><br>
            Numerous studies confirm that organic farming has a positive long-term impact on ecosystems. Research from Europe and the U.S. shows significant improvements in soil quality and biodiversity over decades.</p>
