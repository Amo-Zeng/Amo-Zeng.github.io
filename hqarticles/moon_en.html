<!-- Example of in-page ad display code -->
```html
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-2524390523678591"
     data-ad-slot="9876543210"
     data-ad-format="auto"
     data-full-width-responsive="true">
</ins>
<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
```

**Implementation Suggestions:**
- Replace `data-ad-slot` with your specific ad unit ID obtained from AdSense
- Place the ad code before the main content to improve click-through rate

#### 2. Responsive Design Validation

Your `<meta name="viewport">` has been properly configured. It is recommended to add the following CSS to enhance the mobile experience:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  section {
    padding: 10px 15px;
  }
  nav ul {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

#### 3. Multilingual Support Enhancement

The current language switch button functionality is not yet implemented. You may add the following JavaScript:
```javascript
function toggleLanguage() {
  if (document.documentElement.lang === 'zh') {
    // Switch to English version
    window.location.href = '../en/privacy.html';
  } else {
    // Switch to Chinese version
    window.location.href = '../zh/privacy.html';
  }
}
```

### II. Content Quality Optimization Plan

#### 1. SEO Enhancement Suggestions

**Current Status:**
- Page title contains core keywords: "Artificial Intelligence, Data Privacy"
- Meta description accurately summarizes the content

**Optimization Directions:**
- Naturally integrate keywords into the first sentence of the H2 paragraphs:  
  _"With continuous breakthroughs in AI technology, data privacy protection is facing unprecedented challenges."_
- Add structured data example:
```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Data Privacy Protection Strategies in AI Development",
  "description": "Analyzes the impact of AI on data privacy and proposes response strategies",
  "keywords": ["AI Ethics", "Privacy Regulations", "Data Security"],
  "datePublished": "2023-10-01"
}
</script>
```

  <p>Your data privacy awareness score: <span id="score">0</span>/3</p>
  <button onclick="takeQuiz()">Take Quiz</button>
</section>

<script>

### III. Performance & Asset Optimization

#### 1. Lazy Loading for Images (e.g., When Adding Diagrams):
```html
<img src="placeholder.jpg" 
     data-src="ai-privacy-diagram.png"

     class="lazyload">
```

#### 2. Web Font Optimization Suggestions:
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Sans+SC:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
<style>
body {
  font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', sans-serif;
