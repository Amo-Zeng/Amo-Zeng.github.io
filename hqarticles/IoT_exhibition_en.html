                <p>At the entrance of the 2024 Asia IoT Expo, a massive dynamic sand table is staging a silent revolution: a user softly says, "I'm a bit cold, but I don't want it too dry." Instantly, the air conditioner, lights, audio system, and aroma diffuser coordinate a response—not through a central controller's unified command, but through autonomous negotiation over the local network. This is no longer the "connect everything" IoT 1.0, but the <strong>AI large model-driven era of IoT 2.0</strong>. This exhibition acts like a prism, refracting triple transformations in technology, society, and commerce, all pointing to a deeper proposition: <strong>When the Internet of Things truly "understands" humans, how will it reshape our world?</strong></p>

            <section>
                <h3>The First Mirror: Technology - The Cognitive Leap from "Remote Control" to "New Operating System"</h3>
                <p>In the exhibition's "Smart Space" zone, natural language interaction systems are the focal point. A user asks, "Help me find the blue shirt I wore last week." The system, using wardrobe RFID, camera images, and calendar events, quickly locates it. This is no longer simple information retrieval, but a <strong>search engine for the physical world</strong>—the IoT becomes a database queryable by natural language and capable of dynamic response.</p>
                
                <p>The real transformation happens in the "backend." In the "Edge AI" zone, companies like NVIDIA and Horizon showcase the deployment of lightweight large models on the edge. Through techniques like model pruning and quantization, 7B parameter models can now run on edge devices, enabling low-latency, high-privacy local inference. In a "Smart Factory" demo, multiple robots autonomously negotiate搬运 paths through a local multimodal AI system (integrating vision, force, and position sensors) without uploading to the cloud, improving response speed by 3 times.</p>
                
                <p>Multimodal fusion becomes a technical focus. Huawei's "vision-speech-sensor" trinity system can comprehensively judge scenarios like an elderly person falling, with an accuracy rate of 98%. This demonstrates the potential of <strong>cross-modal semantic alignment</strong>. But challenges remain severe: limited edge computing power, lack of standardized negotiation protocols between devices, and high energy consumption of AI inference. At the "AIoT Architecture Forum," experts proposed a "dynamic inference" strategy: intelligently selecting local lightweight models or requesting cloud large models based on task complexity to achieve optimal energy efficiency.</p>
                
                <p>The core of this technological revolution is that <strong>AI large models evolve from cloud "tools" to the IoT's "new operating system"</strong>. It doesn't directly control devices but understands human intent,调度全域资源, achieving a fundamental leap from "manual control" to "environmental response." The devices on display are no longer isolated "things" but a <strong>network of intelligent agents with perception, understanding, and decision-making capabilities</strong>.</p>

                <h3>The Second Mirror: Society - When the "Helpful Spirit" Becomes a "Digital Third Party," Does Home Still Have Warmth?</h3>
                <p>In the "Future Home" zone, smart pillboxes remind the elderly to take medication, cameras identify children returning from school, and the system prepares hot water in advance for a working partner. The booth commentator enthusiastically explains: "This is true smart living!" However, in front of the interactive installation "Tech Ethics Theater" in a corner, the audience falls silent—three short plays reveal the underlying ethical undercurrents of technology.</p>
                
                <h4>Act One: The Substitution of Care and the Dilution of Responsibility</h4>
                <p>A daughter installs a full monitoring system for her mother but awakens with a start when the system misses a report: "When was the last time I measured her blood sugar with my own hands?" Technology simplifies care into "event response," while those <strong>clumsy, non-timed, slightly redundant interactions</strong> in human emotion are precisely the warmth algorithms cannot quantify. A viewer murmurs, "Have we outsourced 'filial piety' to machines?"</p>
                
                <h4>Act Two: The "Digital Third Party" in Intimate Relationships</h4>
                <p>A smart desk monitors a child's posture and concentration, sparking parent-child conflict. "It's always telling on me!" the young boy's protest reveals the dilemma of the IoT as a "super observer": <strong>When care is conveyed through data reports, it easily alienates into control</strong>. A child psychologist reminds: technology can assist parenting but cannot replace the purposeless, mistake-allowing companionship between parent and child.</p>
                
                <h4>Act Three: The Blurring of the Responsible Subject</h4>
                <p>The smart fridge automatically orders milk but is delayed. Who is responsible? The user, algorithm designer, logistics platform, or network service provider? The IoT分散决策权 to multiple technical nodes, yet makes the <strong>responsible subject unclear</strong>. An interactive screen for "Family Digital Contract"提议: family members need to negotiate together, clarify what can be delegated to machines and what must be done by humans, and agree on data boundaries. This is not just a technical agreement but an ethical practice of <strong>reshaping family trust and responsibility boundaries</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>At the end of the "Tech Ethics Theater," only 28% of viewers were willing to fully rely on intelligent systems to care for family members. This reveals a collective清醒: we desire convenience but refuse to let emotions be instrumentalized. Hopefully, some designs position technology as a "relationship catalyst": the pillbox plays a child's voice as a reminder, the robot suggests "You should call your granddaughter." <strong>The true wisdom of the IoT perhaps lies in how it makes us more human</strong>.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>The Third Mirror: Commerce - The Value Revolution from "Selling Products" to "Selling Outcomes"</h3>
                <p>In the "Industrial Interconnection" zone, Sany Heavy Industry showcases the "Equipment Health Index"; in the "Smart Mobility" area, BYD displays "Autonomous Driving Subscription Services"; on the "Digital Agriculture" stand, DJI charges based on "cost per mu of operation." These changes reveal a fundamental commercial revolution: <strong>The IoT is ending the old era of "selling products" and opening a new epoch of "selling outcomes."</strong></p>
                
                <p>The true disruptive power of the IoT is that it allows <strong>value to flow at extremely fine granularity</strong>. Sany's excavators charge based on "actual cubic meters of earth moved," DJI's drones settle accounts based on "acreage sprayed + prevention效果." This means SMEs can use top-tier equipment without huge capital investment, and the <strong>innovation threshold is significantly lowered</strong>. In the "Shared Manufacturing" zone, 3D printers automatically charge based on "number of printed layers + material consumption," increasing utilization by 300%.</p>
                
                <p>But a deeper change is the construction of "service ecosystems." NIO offers "full lifecycle mobility services": users pay a monthly fee for vehicle use, battery replacement, autonomous driving upgrades, dynamic insurance adjustment, etc. The automaker's revenue structure shifts from "selling cars" to "operating users"—<strong>data, algorithms, and partner integration capabilities</strong> become the core profit source. Similarly, refrigeration equipment companies no longer sell cold storage but provide "end-to-end temperature control guarantee services," charging commissions based on service effectiveness.</p>
                
                <p>"Digital Twin" becomes key to servitization落地. Siemens' factory digital twin system can predict failures, automatically trigger maintenance, and even sign "automatic procurement contracts" via blockchain. This means <strong>predictive maintenance shifts from "manual inspection" to "algorithm-driven,"</strong> improving service response speed by 90%. A water pump manufacturer, through digital twins, monitors water usage in real-time, charging service fees based on "water conservation effect + energy consumption reduction."</p>
                
                <p>However, challenges remain huge: how to standardize micro-service billing platforms? How to confirm and trade data assets? How to execute and resolve disputes for automated contracts? Enterprises propose "IoT + blockchain" solutions: using smart contracts to automate the entire service process with immutable data.</p>
                
                <p>The core of this commercial revolution is that <strong>the core competitiveness of enterprises shifts from "manufacturing capability" to "ecosystem operation capability"</strong>. The future winners are not companies that can make the best products, but platform enterprises that can integrate data, algorithms, and partners to provide users with "one-stop value outcomes." The products on display are just the entry point; the real value lies in the service network behind the product.</p>

                <h3>The Convergence of the Three Mirrors: Towards an "IoT Civilization"</h3>
                <p>When the triple transformations in technology, society, and commerce converge at the exhibition, we see not just device upgrades, but a <strong>civilizational leap</strong>. AI large models become the "new operating system," enabling the IoT to truly "understand" humans; the ethics theater reveals the responsibility dilemmas behind the "digital helpful spirit"; the商业范式 shifts from "selling products" to "selling outcomes," promoting on-demand value flow.</p>
                
                <p>These three are not isolated: <strong>technology is the foundation, society is the constraint, commerce is the driving force</strong>. The decision-making capability of AI large models needs an ethical framework to constrain its boundaries; the construction of service ecosystems relies on technology to achieve granular value flow; and innovation in business models, in turn, drives technological iteration and social acceptance.</p>
                
                <p>The exhibition sends a clear signal: the competition in IoT 2.0 has shifted from "connection density" to "cognitive depth," from "function realization" to "value reconstruction." The future IoT should not just be "smarter devices," but become a <strong>"human-machine co-governance" platform that promotes human connection, enhances social well-being, and drives economic innovation</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>At the exhibition's closing forum, a scholar proposed: "We are witnessing the birth of an 'IoT civilization.'" It is not about machines replacing humans, but about <strong>humans and machines, in the balance of technology, ethics, and commerce,共同构建 a smarter, warmer, more sustainable future</strong>. When an AI large model understands "I'm a bit cold, but I don't want it too dry," it understands not just temperature, but the human desire for comfort and dignity. This is the true wisdom of the IoT.</p>
