            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In an era of rapid technological advancement, exoskeleton technology not only serves as a tool to enhance physical human capabilities but also bridges emotional and social interaction, personalized customization, and environmental adaptation. By integrating advanced sensors, artificial intelligence, 3D printing, and biofeedback technology, exoskeletons are evolving towards greater intelligence, personalization, and multifunctionality.</p>

            <h3>Emotional and Social Interaction: The New Role of Exoskeletons</h3>
            <p>The application of exoskeletons has gone beyond traditional physical assistance, delving into the realm of emotional and social interaction:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Therapy for Children with Autism:</strong> Exoskeletons can mimic body language and facial expressions, helping children with autism better understand and express emotions. By analyzing the expressions of people around them in real-time, exoskeletons can guide children to respond appropriately, enhancing their naturalness in social contexts. This technology aids in the development of social skills for children with autism, providing a more natural form of interaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotion Recognition and Simulation:</strong> Using bio-signals and AI algorithms, exoskeletons can detect changes in user emotions and provide appropriate emotional feedback. For example, when a user feels stressed, the exoskeleton can automatically adjust its support or use subtle vibrations to alleviate tension. This emotional enhancement is not only a technological advancement but also a human-centered design, making the exoskeleton a medium for daily emotional exchange.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Personalized Customization and Biofeedback</h3>
            <p>The development of exoskeleton technology is evident in its high degree of personalization and user adaptability:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>3D Printing Technology:</strong> With 3D printing, exoskeletons can be tailored to fit the user's specific body measurements, enhancing comfort and efficiency. This customization not only reduces physical discomfort but also ensures precision and comfort for the user.</li>
                <li><strong>Biofeedback Systems:</strong> Real-time monitoring of the user's muscle activity, heart rate, and other biological signals allows intelligent algorithms to dynamically adjust the support provided by the exoskeleton, optimizing rehabilitation or work processes. In the future, this technology might include deeper data collection, like nerve conduction velocity, to further enhance the adaptability and rehabilitation outcomes of the exoskeleton.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Environmental Adaptability and Multifunction Integration</h3>
            <p>Exoskeletons must not only adapt to daily human life but also handle various extreme environments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adaptation to Extreme Environments:</strong> From underwater to deserts, from polar regions to battlefields, exoskeletons need to incorporate waterproof, dustproof, and cold-resistant functions, along with life support, communication, and navigation systems. These features make them indispensable in research, rescue, and military operations, enhancing user survival and operational capabilities under extreme conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Modular Design:</strong> Future exoskeletons will employ modular structures, allowing for quick replacement of different functional modules to suit various environments and task requirements. This design not only increases the device's flexibility but also reduces maintenance and upgrade costs, making exoskeletons more practical.</li>
                <li><strong>Materials Science:</strong> Using lightweight, high-strength materials like carbon fiber and titanium alloys, the durability and functionality of exoskeletons are improved. The application of smart materials and flexible electronics allows the exoskeleton to adaptively deform to fit different usage scenarios, enhancing device adaptability and user comfort.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Future Outlook</h3>
            <p>As technology continues to advance, exoskeletons will have profound impacts in the following areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Medical Rehabilitation and Daily Life:</strong> Providing not just physical support but also emotional interaction, promoting psychological rehabilitation. Elderly or mobility-impaired individuals will reduce feelings of loneliness through exoskeletons, enhancing their quality of life.</li>
                <li><strong>Education Sector:</strong> Especially in special education, exoskeletons can help students with learning difficulties enhance social skills through simulation and guidance, offering a new type of educational aid.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial and Military Applications:</strong> Exoskeletons will become versatile assistants for workers, soldiers, and emergency responders, offering protection, enhancing capabilities, and providing environmental adaptability, thereby improving work efficiency and safety.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Exoskeleton technology is transitioning from a single-function tool to a comprehensive platform that integrates emotional interaction, personalized customization, and environmental adaptation. In the future, exoskeletons will not only extend the body but also become a new way for humans to interact with their environment, truly achieving human-machine integration. This will help humans understand each other better, enhance overall social interaction and empathy. Technological advancements will make exoskeletons an indispensable part of daily life, bringing smarter, personalized, and human-centered solutions.</p>
