            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This article explores the formation mechanism and social significance of a new financial paradigm in the digital era. Research reveals that social media sentiment, digital financial technology, and the emotional impact of climate change collectively shape a complex "emotional economy" system. This system, by reshaping asset pricing mechanisms, altering investment behavior patterns, and influencing policy responses, is颠覆ing traditional financial theoretical frameworks. The analysis unfolds from three dimensions: emotional economy, financial inclusion, and emotional pricing of climate change, revealing the significant role of irrational factors in financial markets and providing new methodological perspectives for building intelligent, humane, and sustainable financial ecosystems.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the wave of digital transformation, the operational logic of financial markets is undergoing unprecedented changes. The intertwined influence of social media platforms, digital financial technology, and climate change has created a new "emotional economy" system. This system not only challenges the rational assumptions of traditional financial theory but also reshapes asset pricing mechanisms, investor behavior patterns, and policy response methods. This article aims to analyze the formation mechanism and social impact of the new financial paradigm in the digital era through the lenses of emotional economy, financial inclusion, and emotional pricing of climate change, providing a new theoretical framework for understanding the evolution of contemporary financial markets.</p>

            <h2>1. Emotional Economy: How Social Media Language Reshapes Financial Markets</h2>
            <p>The rapid rise of social media has provided a new platform for the spread of emotions in financial markets. Using natural language processing (NLP) technology, researchers can construct quantitative metrics such as "sentiment indices" to predict market fluctuations. Studies show that the Twitter sentiment index achieves an 87% accuracy rate in predicting stock market trends, highlighting the significant role of emotion-driven behavior in financial markets. This emotion-driven market behavior not only challenges the rational assumptions of traditional financial theory but also reveals the "resonance effect" of emotional propagation.</p>
            <p>The 2021 GameStop event fully demonstrated the immense influence of the emotional economy. Through emotional mobilization and collective action on Reddit forums, retail investors successfully drove up the stock price against institutional short sellers. This event was driven by emotional polarization, the transformation from language to action, and the network resonance effect. Social media algorithms amplify emotional volatility through selective reinforcement and information cocoon effects, even creating "emotional bubbles." This phenomenon not only changes the logic of asset pricing but also raises new demands for regulatory technology and investor education.</p>

            <h2>2. The Hidden Costs of Financial Inclusion: The Double-Edged Sword of Digital Finance</h2>
            <p>The development of digital finance has significantly improved financial inclusion, enabling more people to access modern financial services. However, this inclusivity comes with hidden costs. Issues such as information asymmetry, technological dependency, consumer guidance, and over-financialization may trap low-income groups in cognitive exploitation while they enjoy convenience. For example, some digital credit platforms, through high-interest rates and hidden fees, essentially form "convenient usury," and the application of big data technology leads to data exploitation, where users surrender personal data without substantial returns.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the convenience of digital finance may exacerbate consumer guidance risks, leading low-income groups to use credit for unnecessary consumption rather than productive investment, resulting in debt accumulation and psychological stress. The trend of over-financialization may weaken societal risk resilience and increase systemic financial risks. To address these challenges, policymakers need to enhance information disclosure, protect data privacy, guide healthy consumption concepts, and seek a balance between financialization and the real economy.</p>

            <h2>3. Emotional Pricing of Climate Change: How Psychological Expectations Reshape Green Asset Valuation</h2>
            <p>The emotional pricing mechanism of climate change reveals the significant role of psychological expectations in green finance. Extreme climate events and media-driven "climate anxiety" are fostering a latent pricing mechanism. Research shows that groups with a high sense of urgency about climate change are more likely to accept green asset premiums, while those with a low sense of urgency may underestimate climate risks. This emotionally driven market anomaly leads to a surge in green stock trading volumes but also increases volatility.</p>
            <p>Cross-cultural differences in risk perception further exacerbate the market stratification of green finance. High-risk-averse cultures focus more on the long-term stability of green bonds, while low-risk-averse cultures favor short-term gains from technological breakthroughs. Media agenda-setting and the "policy window of opportunity" effect of disaster events accelerate the process from consensus to policy implementation. To address the challenges of emotional pricing, it is necessary to build a "psychology-market-policy" triadic model, adopt differentiated policy toolkits, and guard against the risks of emotional bubbles.</p>

            <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The emotional economy, financial inclusion, and emotional pricing of climate change collectively form the core elements of the new financial paradigm in the digital era. This paradigm not only reveals the significant role of irrational factors in financial markets but also presents new policy challenges and research directions. Moving forward, how to identify genuine emotional signals in algorithms? How to maintain investment independence in algorithm-driven environments? How to expand financial inclusion while avoiding cognitive exploitation? These questions are not only technical challenges but also critical issues in the evolution of financial ethics and market culture.</p>
            <p>By delving into emotional economy, financial inclusion, and emotional pricing of climate change, we can potentially build a more intelligent, humane, and sustainable financial ecosystem. Such an ecosystem would not only enhance market efficiency but also promote social equity and economic development, providing a new methodological perspective for the future of finance in the digital era. Simultaneously, researchers, policymakers, and market participants need to collaborate closely to address these emerging challenges, ensuring that financial innovation genuinely serves the sustainable development of society.</p>
