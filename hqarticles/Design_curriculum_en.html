            <h2>Introduction: From Instrumental Rationality to Ethical Practice</h2>
            <p>In the dual context of accelerating technological iteration and escalating social complexity, the traditional model of design education—centered on "skill transmission"—is facing a systemic crisis. Design is no longer merely the mediation between aesthetics and function; it has become an ethical practice embedded within social, ecological, and technological networks. This article proposes a new paradigm for design education grounded in "responsibility topology" as a theoretical framework and "anti-skill" as a pedagogical strategy, with "systems thinking" and "embodied cognition" at its core. The goal is to shift design education from instrumental rationality toward ethical practice.</p>

            <h3>1. Responsibility Topology: Reconstructing the Ethical Coordinates of Design Education</h3>
            <p>"Responsibility Topology" is the core theoretical construct of this article, emerging from a critical reflection on the phenomenon of "responsibility diffusion" in technology ethics. In complex systems, the consequences of design actions often exceed the control boundaries of individuals or organizations, rendering traditional linear causality inadequate for understanding how responsibility is distributed and transmitted. Inspired by Latour's (2005) "Actor-Network Theory" (ANT), responsibility topology emphasizes that responsibility is not a static attribution but a dynamic configuration and reconfiguration enacted through heterogeneous actors—humans, objects, institutions, environments—within networks. Design education must guide students to understand the "topological" impacts of their actions—i.e., how minor design decisions may trigger systemic consequences through nonlinear feedback loops.</p>
            <p>Under this framework, the curriculum no longer focuses on *how* to design, but on *why* to design, *for whom*, and *how* design reshapes social relations. For example, in a sustainable product design course, students are required to map "responsibility networks," identifying ethical nodes across material extraction, manufacturing, distribution, usage, maintenance, and disposal, while assessing the potential impacts of design choices on marginalized communities, ecosystems, and future generations. This pedagogical practice transforms responsibility from an abstract value into an operational analytical tool, achieving the "de-abstractification" of ethics education.</p>

            <h3>2. Anti-Skill: A Pedagogical Strategy Beyond Technicism</h3>
            <p>Traditional design education overemphasizes "skill mastery" (e.g., software operation, modeling techniques, visual representation), narrowing design ability into a quantifiable, trainable set of operations. However, in the face of systemic complexity, singular skills often exacerbate "technical blind spots"—where designers, dependent on tools, overlook deeper social structures. To counter this, this article proposes the "anti-skill" (anti-skill) pedagogical strategy. It does not reject skills, but uses "deskillification" processes to break the cult of tools and stimulate critical reflection.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Skill Delay</strong>: In the early stages of a course, avoid teaching software. Instead, use non-technical media such as hand-drawing, collage, and scenario simulation to guide students to focus on the essence of problems rather than expressive forms;</li>
                <li><strong>Skill Deconstruction</strong>: Encourage students to deconstruct mature design cases, revealing underlying power structures, cultural biases, and market manipulation—e.g., analyzing how a brand's packaging conceals environmental costs;</li>
                <li><strong>Skill Substitution</strong>: Introduce non-traditional media (e.g., body movement, sound, scent) for design expression, activating "embodied cognition"—the idea that knowledge is not generated solely by the brain, but through the interaction between body and environment (Varela et al., 1991). For instance, in service design courses, students role-play the physical limitations experienced by people with disabilities in public service systems, generating more empathetic solutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This strategy effectively prevents cognitive rigidity caused by premature skill acquisition, enabling students to build systemic and critical cognitive foundations *before* mastering technical skills.</p>

            <h3>3. Systems Thinking: The Cognitive Foundation for Interdisciplinary Integration</h3>
            <p>Design problems are fundamentally complex systems problems, involving interwoven variables from technology, society, economics, and ecology. Therefore, the curriculum must anchor cognition in "systems thinking," helping students identify feedback loops, leverage points, and delay effects within systems. Drawing from Meadows' (2008) theory of systems intervention, the course introduces tools such as causal loop diagrams and system dynamics models to train students to understand design impacts holistically, rather than in isolation.</p>
            <p>In a "redesign of urban public space" project, students must build a system model incorporating variables such as population flow, microclimate, social equity, and maintenance costs, simulating the long-term effects of different design proposals. For example, while increasing greenery improves aesthetics, it may lead to marginalization of low-income communities due to rising maintenance costs. Such exercises push students beyond "visual optimization" into the realm of "systemic adjustment," helping them understand design as "intervention" rather than "beautification."</p>
            <p>Systems thinking also drives interdisciplinary knowledge integration. The course invites experts from sociology, environmental science, and public policy to co-teach, forming a "knowledge co-creation" mechanism. For example, in an ecological design module, ecologists provide data on native species, sociologists analyze community usage patterns, and students synthesize this information into "eco-social co-design" solutions. This collaborative model not only enriches knowledge dimensions but also cultivates students' ability to integrate heterogeneous information in real-world contexts.</p>

            <h3>4. Embodied Practice: The Mechanism of Translation from Cognition to Action</h3>
            <p>Theoretical cognition must be transformed into design capability through practice. This article emphasizes "embodied practice" as the key pathway for pedagogical transformation. Unlike the traditional "learn first, do later" model, embodied practice advocates "learning by doing," achieving internalization of knowledge and ethical awareness simultaneously through bodily engagement, immersive scenarios, and iterative prototyping.</p>
            <p>The curriculum designs three types of embodied activities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scenario Simulation</strong>: e.g., wearing weighted devices to experience the physical challenges faced by the elderly in public spaces;</li>
                <li><strong>Prototype Testing</strong>: deploying design prototypes in real communities to observe user behavior and collect feedback;</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborative Co-Creation</strong>: inviting marginalized groups such as community members, people with disabilities, and indigenous populations to participate in the design process, breaking the monopoly of expert authority.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Such practices not only enhance design effectiveness but also deepen students' ethical responsibility toward the "other." Notably, embodied practice is not merely "experience"—it is embedded within the framework of responsibility topology. Every bodily interaction becomes a node in the responsibility network, requiring students to reflect on their own position and impact within the interaction.</p>

            <h3>5. Implementation Pathways for Interdisciplinary Curricula: From Concept to Institution</h3>
            <p>To institutionalize the above ideas, this article proposes three implementation pathways for interdisciplinary curricula:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Modular Curriculum Structure</strong>: Break down disciplinary silos by building a "core modules + interdisciplinary electives" system. Core modules focus on systems thinking, responsibility topology, and anti-skill strategies; elective modules are co-taught across disciplines (e.g., "Ecology-Design," "Policy-Service"), allowing students to freely combine them based on project needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborative Teaching Mechanism</strong>: Establish a "dual mentorship" system, where design instructors co-supervise projects with domain experts (e.g., sociologists, ecologists). Course evaluation uses a "multi-dimensional assessment matrix," covering depth of systems analysis, quality of ethical reflection, and effectiveness of embodied practice, avoiding a singular focus on technical skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-World Context Integration</strong>: Build long-term partnerships with local governments, community organizations, and non-profits, embedding course projects into real social challenges. For example, linking with urban renewal projects enables students to design under real policy and resource constraints, enhancing the legitimacy of their practice.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Design education is shifting from "making things" to "governing affairs," from "skill transmission" to "cultivating responsibility." Responsibility topology provides a dynamic analytical framework for design ethics, the anti-skill strategy deconstructs technicist illusions, and systems thinking and embodied cognition build the cognitive and practical foundations for interdisciplinary learning. Future curricula should transcend disciplinary boundaries, anchor themselves in real-world social problems, and achieve a deep transformation from "design education" to "responsibility education" through modular structures, collaborative teaching, and real-world integration. Only in this way can design become a systemic force for social good.</p>
