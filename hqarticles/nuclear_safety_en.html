            <h2>A Comprehensive Perspective on Technology, Tracking, and Policy</h2>
            <p>As the global demand for clean energy continues to grow, the importance of nuclear safety has become increasingly prominent. Nuclear energy, as an efficient and low-carbon energy form, is particularly significant. In this context, innovations in artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain technology, and hybrid energy systems offer new possibilities for nuclear safety monitoring, nuclear material tracking, and the integration of nuclear energy with sustainable energy. This article aims to delve into the applications of these technologies and their contributions to building a safe, stable, and sustainable nuclear future.</p>

            <h3>Revolutionary Role of Artificial Intelligence in Nuclear Safety Monitoring</h3>
            <p>Artificial intelligence, through advanced machine learning algorithms and big data analysis, has brought revolutionary changes to nuclear safety monitoring. Real-time data analysis and fault prediction technologies use high-precision sensors and real-time data collection systems to continuously monitor reactor parameters, promptly detect abnormal signals, and even predict potential failures before they occur. For example, Google's DeepMind team has collaborated with a UK nuclear company to develop an AI system that can predict equipment failures and issue early warnings by analyzing data from nuclear power plant cooling systems, significantly reducing unplanned downtime and enhancing the operational efficiency and safety of nuclear facilities.</p>

            <h3>Key Role of Blockchain Technology in Nuclear Material Tracking</h3>
            <p>The decentralized and tamper-proof nature of blockchain technology offers new possibilities for building an efficient and transparent nuclear material tracking system. Through blockchain technology, a global nuclear material tracking system can be constructed, where the source, processing, transportation, storage, and final use of each nuclear material are meticulously recorded on the blockchain. This immutability and transparency not only help in promptly detecting and preventing illegal activities but also enhance international trust in nuclear material management. For instance, the real-time nature of blockchain allows all parties to instantly access the latest nuclear material information, promptly detecting and preventing anomalies.</p>
