            <h3>1. The Seed of Ancient Greece: The Blending of Geometry and Number Theory</h3>
            <p>The history of Pell's Equation can be traced back to ancient Greece, where the Pythagorean school's pursuit of integer solutions initiated the investigation. Equations of the form \( x^2 - 2y^2 = 1 \) piqued the interest of early mathematicians, although their research remained at a preliminary stage. Archimedes also touched upon similar problems in his works, but a systematic theory did not emerge. Greek mathematicians laid the foundation for the study of Pell's Equation through the blending of geometry and number theory, demonstrating the transition from concrete to abstract mathematical problems.</p>

            <p>The real systematic study of Pell's Equation began in India in the 7th century. Mathematician Brahmagupta systematically investigated Pell's Equation in his work "Brahmasphutasiddhanta," and introduced the "Brahmagupta Identity." This identity shows that if \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) are solutions to the equation, then \( (x_1x_2 + Ny_1y_2, x_1y_2 + x_2y_1) \) is also a solution. This discovery provided a theoretical basis for generating new solutions from known ones, laying the core framework for the theory of Pell's Equation. The contributions of Indian mathematicians not only demonstrated the systemization capability of theoretical mathematics but also provided powerful tools for subsequent mathematicians.</p>
