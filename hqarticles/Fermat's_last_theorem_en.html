            <h2>Multidimensional Interpretation of Fermat's Last Theorem: The Fusion of History, Education, and Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Fermat's Last Theorem is one of the most famous unsolved problems in the history of mathematics, proposed by French mathematician Pierre de Fermat in 1637. While reading the works of the ancient Greek mathematician Diophantus, Fermat wrote a famous note in the margin of the book:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"I have a truly marvelous proof of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The proposition states:</p>
            <p><strong>For any integer \( n \) greater than 2, the equation \( x^n + y^n = z^n \) has no positive integer solutions.</strong></p>
            <p>Fermat's statement sparked over three and a half centuries of exploration and debate in the mathematical community, culminating in its proof by British mathematician Andrew Wiles in 1994. This achievement marked a significant milestone in mathematical history, profoundly influencing the development of mathematics, educational practices, and philosophical thinking. In the following sections, we will explore the multifaceted significance of Fermat's Last Theorem from the perspectives of history and culture, education and inspiration, and science and philosophy.</p>

            <h3>Historical and Cultural Perspective: A Mathematical Legend Across Time</h3>
            <p>Fermat's Last Theorem is not only a significant problem in the history of mathematics but also holds profound cultural significance. Fermat lived in the 17th century, a period of transition from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment era in Europe. As an amateur mathematician, Fermat's interests spanned number theory, analytic geometry, probability theory, and more. However, Fermat's Last Theorem became one of his most prominent legacies.</p>
            <p>The simplicity of its statement, which almost anyone can understand, contrasts starkly with its extremely complex proof, which took centuries of effort by mathematicians. This duality has made Fermat's Last Theorem a symbol of mathematical challenges, frequently referenced in literature, film, and popular culture. For instance, Simon Singh's bestselling book, "Fermat's Last Theorem," documents the history of this mathematical legend in detail, further bringing it into the public eye.</p>
