            <h2>Fermat's Last Theorem</h2>
            <p>Fermat's Last Theorem is one of the most famous problems in the history of mathematics, proposed by the 17th-century French mathematician Pierre de Fermat and not proven until 1995 by Andrew Wiles. Its solution process not only demonstrated the triumph of mathematical thinking but also reflected the profound psychological journey of humanity, highlighting the significant contributions of modern technology, particularly computer science, in mathematical proofs.</p>

            <h3>Historical Context and Cultural Impact</h3>
            <p>In 17th-century Europe, at the dawn of the mathematical revolution, the aftermath of the Renaissance brought about the liberation of knowledge, with science and mathematics beginning to break free from the constraints of religion and philosophy. Fermat, a lawyer and amateur mathematician, reflected this era's relentless pursuit of knowledge and truth.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Systematization of Mathematical Methods:</strong> Descartes introduced analytic geometry, providing mathematics with a new tool. Fermat's work in number theory also unfolded in this context, advancing mathematics through concise yet profound insights.</li>
                <li><strong>Rise of Number Theory:</strong> Fermat is hailed as a pioneer of number theory; his "Fermat's Little Theorem" and "Fermat's Last Theorem" provided theoretical foundations for future mathematicians, inspiring deep exploration into the properties of integers.</li>
                <li><strong>Publication and Communication:</strong> The advancement in printing technology allowed for wider dissemination of mathematical works. Fermat participated in academic exchange through correspondence and annotations on classical mathematical texts, influencing the development of mathematics in Europe.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Psychological Journey: Persistence, Frustration, and Achievement</h3>
            <p>From a psychological perspective, the experiences of mathematicians in pursuit of Fermat's Last Theorem reflect humanity's desire for knowledge and the drive to conquer the unknown:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Persistence and Determination:</strong> Fermat's Last Theorem seemed simple but was incredibly complex to prove, fueling mathematicians' persistence and determination. This persistence was not just an intellectual exercise but also an emotional investment, challenging personal cognitive boundaries.</li>
                <li><strong>Frustration and Resilience:</strong> Mathematicians faced numerous failures and setbacks. Wiles also encountered significant obstacles during the proof process but demonstrated psychological resilience by reflecting and adjusting strategies, ultimately achieving success.</li>
                <li><strong>Sense of Achievement and Self-Realization:</strong> When Wiles succeeded in proving the theorem, he experienced the highest level in Maslow's hierarchy of needsâ€”self-actualization. This was not only a personal honor but also a victory for collective human wisdom.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Contributions of Modern Technology</h3>
            <p>The proof process by Andrew Wiles marked the importance of computer technology in mathematical proofs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Computer Assistance:</strong> Wiles used computers to verify complex calculations and logical steps during the proof, ensuring accuracy and completeness.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Proof Systems:</strong> Some researchers have used automated proof systems to formally verify Wiles's proof, enhancing its reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact and Prospects:</strong> Computer science not only increased the reliability of proofs but also pushed forward the development of new mathematical fields like computational mathematics and numerical analysis.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The resolution of Fermat's Last Theorem is a victory across disciplines, showcasing the deep integration of historical and cultural contexts, the psychological journey of humanity, and the application of modern technology. From the 17th-century mathematical environment, through the psychological journey of mathematicians, to the use of computer science in mathematical proofs, this process was not just a mathematical exploration but also a reflection of human spirit and technological advancement.</p>
