            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In 2023, Chinese Pingju opera celebrated its 120th anniversary. Originating from a folk "bengbeng opera" that was once marginalized by mainstream traditional opera, Pingju has evolved into a respected "national drama" and a major regional opera today. The century-long transformation of Pingju not only mirrors the development of Chinese opera art but also serves as a vivid example of the传承 and innovation of Chinese culture. With its unique artistic charm and profound cultural内涵, Pingju has showcased a spectacular transformation from grassroots art to high art. However, with the advent of the "Internet+" era, Pingju faces new opportunities and challenges. How to maintain its traditional "people-oriented" essence while leveraging new media to achieve deep integration of art and the times has become an urgent issue for Pingju in the new century.</p>

            <h3>I. Grassroots Foundation: The Original Form and Vitality of Pingju</h3>
            <p>Pingju originated from the folk storytelling art of "Lianhua Luo" in the Luan County area of Hebei Province. This art form, with its simple performances,通俗唱腔, and贴近生活 themes, was deeply loved by the lower class. Early Pingju performers mostly came from the lower stratum of society. They used simple language to tell folk stories and sincere emotions to express the hearts of the people. This deep integration with people's lives infused Pingju with a strong vitality.</p>
            <p>In terms of artistic expression, Pingju inherited the virtualized and stylized features of traditional Chinese opera, while boldly innovating to create a unique "bengbeng opera" style. This performing method was flexible and versatile, with both the solemnity of opera and the lively nature of folk art. Pingju's grassroots nature determined that its creation was always closely tied to real life. From early works like "Yang Sanjie's Appeal" to modern ones like "Flower as a Mediator," Pingju works always reflected social changes and the people's hearts. This profound social concern kept Pingju vibrant among the masses.</p>

            <h3>II. The Soul of Innovation: The Development and Evolution of Pingju's Artistic Forms</h3>
            <p>The first artistic innovation in Pingju occurred in the early 20th century. Artists like Cheng Zhaocai, based on Lianhua Luo, absorbed elements from Peking opera, Bangzi opera, and other forms, creating Pingju's distinctive唱腔 and performing stylization, transforming it from a simple storytelling art into a mature opera genre. The mid-20th century modernization reform was a pivotal turning point in Pingju's history. New literary workers systematically reformed Pingju, introducing modern theater theory while preserving tradition, enriching the performing forms, and expanding artistic expression. This innovation significantly elevated Pingju's artistic level, enabling it to engage in dialogues with mainstream opera.</p>
            <p>Throughout different stages of development, Pingju's innovation always maintained an organic connection with tradition. Whether in唱腔 design, performing stylization, or script creation, Pingju aimed to achieve breakthroughs while preserving its essence. This innovation was not a departure from tradition but a creative transformation. Pingju's innovative spirit laid a solid foundation for its dissemination and acceptance in the new era.</p>

            <h3>III. The Sound and Color of the Jianghu: The Artistic Practice on the Pingju Stage</h3>
            <p>Pingju's "sound" and "color" are the core of its artistic charm. Unlike the rich, soothing唱腔 of Peking opera or the elegant唱腔 of Kunqu, Pingju carries a strong folk atmosphere. Artists skillfully shift between真假声 on stage, vividly portraying the joys and sorrows of life. Every turn of the tune, every breath, reflects the artist's profound pursuit of art.</p>
            <p>Pingju's stage movements also stand out. Unlike the exaggerated strength of Peking opera or the ethereal grace of Kunqu, Pingju's movements convey a simple and warm beauty. Actors use rich body language and subtle facial expressions to reveal the characters' inner worlds to the audience. Each gesture, each glance, is an externalization of the artist's inner emotions. This meticulous attention to artistic details keeps Pingju's stage performance uniquely charming.</p>

            <h3>IV. Pingju's New Media Breakthrough: Rediscovering the Lost "People-Oriented" Essence</h3>
            <p>In the "Internet+" era, Pingju faces unprecedented opportunities and challenges. The massive user base, convenient dissemination, and precise targeting of new media platforms offer Pingju vast development space. However, how to maintain its traditional "people-oriented" essence while achieving modern artistic transformation through new media has become a critical issue for Pingju in the new century.</p>
            <p>Pingju's "people-oriented" essence stems from its close connection with the masses. From "Lianhua Luo" to "bengbeng opera," Pingju has always maintained a "telling people's stories, singing people's feelings" creative tradition. Whether in love stories like "Flower as a Mediator" or rebellious spirits like "Liu Qiaor's Resistance," Pingju always expresses the most sincere emotions in the simplest ways. This "grounded" quality gives Pingju immense vitality.</p>
            <p>The emergence of new media platforms provides Pingju with unprecedented dissemination opportunities. "Pingju singing challenge" on short video platforms, "Pingju emoticons" on social media, and live streams by Pingju actors—these innovative forms bring Pingju closer to young audiences in a more relaxed and approachable manner. However, new media is also a "double-edged sword." Its fast-paced nature poses a risk of fragmenting Pingju's art form. Some hastily produced "fast-food" works, driven by click-through rates, are eroding Pingju's artistic depth. Balancing dissemination heat with artistic quality is a critical issue for Pingju artists.</p>
            <p>Pingju's new media breakthrough should not be a simple "opera + internet" but a rediscovery of Pingju's value in the "internet+" context. First, it must remain rooted in tradition, preserving Pingju's "grassroots" nature, and touching hearts with life-related stories. Second, it must innovate expression by leveraging new media technologies to expand performing forms and rejuvenate traditional art. Pingju artists need to embrace change with an open attitude while steadfastly adhering to artistic principles. Through precise content positioning and innovative dissemination methods, Pingju can truly find its place in the "internet+" era, becoming a cultural bridge connecting tradition and modernity.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Pingju's century-long transformation has witnessed its evolution from grassroots art to national drama. In this process, Pingju not only accomplished its artistic self-renewal but also, with its unique "people-oriented" essence and profound cultural内涵, became a standout in Chinese opera. In the "Internet+" era, Pingju's new media breakthrough is not merely a technical innovation issue but also a cultural awakening. Only when Pingju art truly returns to its "people-oriented" origin can it find its artistic path in the new era and continue to nourish the spiritual world of modern people.</p>
