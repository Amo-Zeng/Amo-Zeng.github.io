            <h3>1. From Subtractive to Additive: A Revolutionary Change in Manufacturing Paradigms</h3>
            <p>Traditional subtractive manufacturing forms final products by removing excess material. While it has a long history and wide applications, its limitations—such as severe resource waste, limited design freedom, and long processing cycles—are becoming increasingly evident. In contrast, additive manufacturing builds products layer by layer, offering significant advantages such as high material utilization, extreme design freedom, and dramatically improved production efficiency.</p>
            <p>The disruptive nature of additive manufacturing is not only technical but also profoundly reshapes traditional manufacturing. In aerospace, lightweight titanium alloy structural components printed with 3D technology not only reduce aircraft weight but also enhance engine performance. In healthcare, the realization of personalized medicine brings patients 3D-printed bone and organ tissues that precisely match their needs. In automotive manufacturing, lightweight body parts and rapid prototyping shorten development cycles and improve market responsiveness.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, additive manufacturing will deeply integrate with technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics, achieving intelligent manufacturing, the digital, networked, and intelligent industrial internet, and diversified applications of composite material additive manufacturing, further propelling the evolution of material processing technology.</p>

            <h3>2. The Green Revolution: A Necessary Path for Sustainable Development</h3>
            <p>Since the Industrial Revolution, material processing technology has significantly propelled human societal progress but also brought severe environmental issues. Problems such as resource waste, energy consumption, and waste emissions have become increasingly prominent, compelling us to re-examine traditional material processing methods and seek more environmentally friendly and sustainable solutions.</p>
            <p>Green processing technologies provide new paths for the sustainable development of material processing by optimizing processes, reducing resource consumption, and minimizing waste emissions. Technologies such as dry machining, low-temperature machining, laser machining, ultrasonic machining, and additive manufacturing not only enhance material utilization and reduce energy consumption but also significantly lower waste and pollutant emissions.</p>
            <p>The practice of circular economy principles in material processing emphasizes the recycling and reuse of resources, reducing the generation of waste. Measures such as recycling and reusing old materials, treating and reusing wastewater, and repurposing waste materials not only reduce resource consumption and waste emissions but also lower production costs and improve economic efficiency for enterprises.</p>
            <p>Building a green manufacturing system requires addressing green design, green production, and green management across the entire industrial chain to achieve sustainable development. The joint efforts of governments, businesses, and the public will drive the green revolution in material processing, contributing greater strength to the sustainable development of human society.</p>
