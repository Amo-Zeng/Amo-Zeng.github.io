            <h2>Multidimensional Applications of Group Theory: From Deep-Sea Mining to Natural Language Processing</h2>
            <p>As a branch of mathematics, group theory, with its profound understanding of symmetry and structure, has demonstrated powerful application potential in multiple fields. This article will explore the multidimensional applications of group theory in deep-sea mining, neural network optimization, and natural language processing, revealing its unique value in complex system modeling, optimization, and analysis.</p>

            <h3>I. Deep-Sea Mining Robots: Resource Optimization and Cooperative Operations from a Group Theory Perspective</h3>
            <p>The deep sea, covering 71% of the Earth's surface, is a mysterious realm rich in mineral resources. However, the complexity of the deep-sea environment (such as high pressure, low temperature, darkness, and currents) poses significant challenges to mining operations. To address these challenges, deep-sea mining robots have emerged, and group theory provides new modeling and optimization ideas for them.</p>
            <h4>1. Group Modeling and Communication Optimization</h4>
            <p>Treating deep-sea mining robots as a group, models are created using graph theory and network flow concepts in group theory. Each robot is represented as a node in the graph, with communication links as edges, optimizing communication protocols by analyzing the structural characteristics of the graph.</p>
            <h4>2. Formation and Cooperative Operations</h4>
            <p>Drawing on group behavior models in group theory, self-organizing formation algorithms are designed to enable robots to form stable formation structures without central control.</p>
            <h4>3. Resource Allocation and Path Planning</h4>
            <p>Using network flow theory in group theory, resource allocation is modeled as a multi-source multi-sink network flow problem, determining the types and quantities of minerals each robot should collect and the transportation paths.</p>

            <h3>II. Neural Network Optimization: Revealing Symmetry Group Structures and Deep Learning's Invariance and Generalization</h3>
            <p>Neural networks excel in deep learning, but their theoretical foundations remain challenging. Group theory offers a new perspective on understanding the essence of neural networks, particularly the symmetry group structure of their weight matrices, revealing the invariance and generalization capabilities in deep learning.</p>
            <h4>1. Symmetry Group Structure of Weight Matrices</h4>
            <p>Neural network weight matrices possess rich symmetries, such as row-column exchange symmetry, rotational symmetry, and translational symmetry.</p>
            <h4>2. Invariance and Generalization</h4>
            <p>The invariance of neural networks is explained by the symmetry group of their weight matrices, while generalization capability is associated with the structure of the symmetry group.</p>
            <h4>3. Utilization and Breaking of Symmetry</h4>
            <p>In neural network design, symmetry can be leveraged to enhance network performance. For example, introducing weight matrices with specific symmetries can strengthen the network's invariance to input data.</p>

            <h3>III. Natural Language Processing: Exploring Symmetry and Regularity in Language</h3>
            <p>Natural language processing (NLP) aims to enable computers to understand, generate, and process human language. Group theory provides new tools for analyzing word distributions in language models, revealing symmetries and regularities in language.</p>
            <h4>1. Group Structure and Symmetry of Words</h4>
            <p>Words are treated as a set, with transformations defined between words through operations like synonym replacement and antonym mapping, forming a transformation group.</p>
            <h4>2. Semantic Similarity and Group Structure</h4>
            <p>Semantic similarity describes the closeness of words in meaning. Group theory provides methods based on group structures to describe semantic similarity.</p>
            <h4>3. Applications of Group Theory in Language Generation and Model Optimization</h4>
            <p>In language generation tasks, group theory is used to describe the symmetry of language generation, guiding the model to generate more reasonable words.</p>

            <h4>1. Automatic Discovery of Group Structures</h4>
            <p>Developing automated methods to discover group structures in deep-sea mining robot groups, neural network weight matrices, and language models is an important research direction.</p>
