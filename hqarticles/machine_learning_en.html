            <h3>II. Ethical Challenges: Moral Dilemmas Behind Technology</h3>
            <p>As machine learning technology is widely applied, a series of ethical issues are emerging, becoming challenges that we must face. Algorithmic bias, data privacy, and responsibility attribution are the three major ethical issues that must be addressed in the development of machine learning.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1. Algorithmic Bias: Unconscious Discrimination in Technology</strong>
                    <p>Bias in machine learning models may stem from historical biases in training data or limitations in algorithm design. Addressing algorithmic bias requires data cleansing and balancing, along with enhancing the transparency and interpretability of algorithms.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>2. Data Privacy: The Tug-of-War Between Technological Advancement and Individual Rights</strong>
                    <p>The powerful capabilities of machine learning rely on the collection of vast amounts of data, bringing threats to data privacy. Key solutions include the principle of data minimization, user control and transparency, and data anonymization and encryption.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>3. Responsibility Attribution: The "Black Box" of Algorithmic Decisions and Ethical Paradoxes</strong>
                    <p>As machine learning is widely applied in decision-making, the issue of responsibility attribution becomes increasingly complex. Enhancing the interpretability and transparency of algorithms, and establishing a multi-party ethical framework, can address issues of responsibility attribution.</p>
