            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Modern cosmology faces a series of complex phenomena from the origin of the universe to its evolutionary trajectory, continuously challenging our understanding of physical laws. With the deep development of quantum mechanics and information theory, these fields provide new perspectives and tools for cosmological research. This article attempts to integrate cosmic expansion, quantum entanglement, and information theory to construct a comprehensive multidimensional cosmological model, aiming to understand the dynamic evolution of the universe and its information transmission mechanisms more deeply.</p>

            <h3>I. Cosmic Expansion: Dynamics After the Big Bang</h3>
            <p>The theory of cosmic expansion originates from Edwin Hubble's observations in the 1920s, where he found that the recession velocity of distant galaxies is proportional to their distance from us. This discovery propelled the development of the Big Bang theory and led to subsequent research:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB)</strong>: CMB provides direct evidence of the early state of the universe, strongly supporting the Big Bang theory.</li>
                <li><strong>Inflation Theory</strong>: This theory explains why the universe expanded rapidly in an extremely short time (about 10^-36 seconds), addressing the flatness and horizon problems of the universe.</li>
                <li><strong>Dark Energy</strong>: Recent observations indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, with dark energy believed to be the driving force behind this acceleration.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Quantum Entanglement: The Mysterious Bond of the Microcosm</h3>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is a peculiar phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more particles, despite being spatially distant, can maintain an instantaneous interaction state. Applications of quantum entanglement in cosmology include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Universal Information Transmission</strong>: Quantum entanglement might provide a way of information transmission that transcends the speed of light, which has profound implications for understanding mechanisms of cosmic information propagation.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantum Cosmology</strong>: In the early stages of the universe, quantum entanglement might have played a crucial role in the formation of cosmic structures and the origins of laws.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h3>III. Information Theory: Encoding and Decoding the Universe</h3>
            <p>Information theory is not only fundamental to computer science but also plays a significant role in physics and cosmology:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hawking Radiation and Black Hole Information Paradox</strong>: Stephen Hawking proposed that black holes lose mass through radiation, leading to the so-called information loss paradox. Information theory offers a potential solution, suggesting that information might be encoded and transmitted through radiation.</li>
                <li><strong>Universal Information Capacity</strong>: The universe can be viewed as a vast information processing system, where its information capacity might be related to its physical size and rate of expansion.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>IV. Integrated Model: Fusion of Multiple Perspectives</h3>
            <p>By integrating cosmic expansion, quantum entanglement, and information theory, we can construct a multidimensional cosmological model:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Quantum Entanglement and Cosmic Expansion</strong>: Quantum entanglement might have driven the inflation phase of the universe, promoting rapid expansion.</li>
                <li><strong>Information Theory and Dark Energy</strong>: Dark energy might be related to the universe's information capacity, where the accelerating expansion could be a manifestation of the cosmic information processing system trying to maximize its information capacity.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantum Mechanics and Cosmic Structure</strong>: The structure of the universe might originate from early quantum fluctuations, which spread through the universe via quantum entanglement and information transmission mechanisms, forming the structures we observe today.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>By combining cosmic expansion, quantum entanglement, and information theory, we offer a richer and more complex cosmological model. This model not only explains existing observational phenomena but also opens new avenues for future theoretical and experimental research. With advancements in quantum computing and information technology, we hope to reveal the deep connections between these theories, further pushing our understanding of the essence of the universe.</p>
