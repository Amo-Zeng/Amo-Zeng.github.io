            <h2>Consumer Behavior in the Digital Age: Blind Spots and Risks in Food Choices</h2>
            <p>In today's rapidly advancing digital era, consumer behavior in food choices has undergone profound changes. Social media and review platforms have become significant channels for food recommendations, enabling consumers to make quick purchase decisions through online shopping and short video sharing. However, in this wave of digitalization, the threats to food safety have not diminished; instead, they have become more complex and covert due to the overlapping impacts of new consumption patterns and climate change. Food safety is no longer an isolated issue but a systemic challenge intertwined with consumer behavior in the Digital Age, supply chain risks, and global climate change.</p>

            <h3>1. Consumer Behavior in the Digital Age: Blind Spots and Risks in Food Choices</h3>
            <p>The rise of social media has provided consumers with convenient channels for food recommendations, and trendy food establishments and products quickly gain popularity. Consumers often overlook food safety concerns due to "high aesthetics" or "unique experiences." Behind this phenomenon of blindly following trends, there lies a potential risk of food poisoning.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information Asymmetry:</strong> The content on social media is often carefully curated and beautified, with consumers seeing only what businesses want to showcase.</li>
                <li><strong>Quick Decision-Making:</strong> The immediacy and interactivity of the digital age prompt consumers to make rapid decisions, reducing their in-depth consideration of product quality and safety.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. The "Invisible Crisis" of the Supply Chain: Risks from Farm to Table</h3>
            <p>The supply chain from farm to table is a complex chain involving planting, breeding, processing, transportation, storage, and sales. Each link can potentially be the trigger for a food safety incident, and climate change further exacerbates these risks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Agony of the Source:</strong> Risks of pesticide residues and antibiotic abuse.</li>
                <li><strong>The Pain of Cold Chains:</strong> Risks of temperature失控 and cross-contamination.</li>
                <li><strong>The Worry of Storage:</strong> Risks of improper storage and environmental pollution.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Climate Change's "Crisis on the Table": The Subtle Driver of Food Poisoning</h3>
            <p>Climate change is not just a global environmental issue; it is also affecting our table safety in unexpected ways. The rise in global temperatures and the frequency of extreme weather events are subtly altering every link in the food supply chain, pushing us into an era where the risk of food poisoning continues to rise.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Production Stage:</strong> Risks of extreme weather and pest outbreaks.</li>
                <li><strong>Transportation Stage:</strong> Risks of climate change and transportation disruptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage Stage:</strong> Risks of high temperatures accelerating food spoilage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Technological Empowerment and Multiparty Collaboration: Building a New Defense for Food Safety</h3>
            <p>Facing the dual challenges of the Digital Age and climate change, traditional food safety regulatory models are no longer sufficient, but emerging technologies offer new approaches to addressing this issue.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blockchain and IoT:</strong> Traceability and real-time monitoring of food safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiparty Collaboration:</strong> Shared responsibility of governments, businesses, and consumers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Conclusion: New Challenges to Food Safety in the Digital Age and Under Climate Change</h3>
            <p>Consumer behavior in the Digital Age and global climate change are profoundly reshaping the landscape of food safety. The rise of social media and extreme weather events triggered by climate change have made the risk points in the food supply chain more diverse and complex. Food safety is no longer an isolated issue but a systemic challenge closely intertwined with consumer behavior, supply chain management, and climate change.</p>
