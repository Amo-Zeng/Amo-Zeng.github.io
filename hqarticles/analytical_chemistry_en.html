            <h3>Disruptive Advantages of Quantum Dot Sensors</h3>
            <p>Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor materials with nanoscale dimensions, whose unique physical and chemical properties make them highly promising in the field of sensors. Quantum dot sensors utilize the optical properties of quantum dots, such as fluorescence intensity, wavelength, and lifetime, to detect target molecules. Compared to traditional analytical methods, quantum dot sensors offer significant advantages in sensitivity, selectivity, and real-time analysis.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensitivity:</strong> The sensitivity of quantum dot sensors far surpasses traditional methods. The fluorescence intensity of quantum dots is directly related to the number of molecules bound to their surface, enabling them to detect trace amounts of target substances.</li>
                <li><strong>Selectivity:</strong> The selectivity of quantum dot sensors primarily relies on surface modification techniques. By modifying the surface of quantum dots with specific molecular recognition elements, such as antibodies, aptamers, or nucleic acids, quantum dot sensors can selectively bind target molecules, achieving high selectivity in detection.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Analysis:</strong> Another significant advantage of quantum dot sensors is their ability to perform real-time analysis. Due to the rapid response of quantum dots' fluorescence properties to the binding of target molecules, quantum dot sensors can quickly detect target substances without the need for complex sample pretreatment.</li>
            </ul>
