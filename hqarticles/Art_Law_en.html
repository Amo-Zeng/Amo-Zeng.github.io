            <h2>Digital Palette and Cultural Gene Bank: New Frontiers in Art and Law</h2>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technology has not only fueled the prosperity of digital art but also reshaped the way intangible cultural heritage is disseminated and protected. From the copyright ownership of NFT digital artworks to the display rights of art in virtual spaces, and to the copyright and ethical issues of AI-generated art, digital art blurs the boundaries of traditional art law. Meanwhile, the intangible and传承性 of intangible cultural heritage poses significant challenges in legal protection, as traditional intellectual property law systems struggle to effectively safeguard this cultural gene bank. This article will explore the common challenges faced by digital art and intangible cultural heritage in legal protection and propose new ideas for constructing an art legal framework adapted to the digital era.</p>

            <h3>Legal Boundaries and Challenges of Digital Art</h3>
            <p>The rise of digital art presents unprecedented challenges to art law. NFTs, as representatives of digital art, have given digital art uniqueness and verifiability through blockchain technology, but have also brought challenges in determining copyright ownership and combating piracy. The proliferation of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies provides new platforms for art creation and display, but also introduces legal issues in virtual spaces, such as the special protection of art display and the copyright ownership of virtual objects. AI-generated art challenges traditional concepts of artistic creation, raising questions about copyright ownership and ethical issues, such as whether AI can be considered an "author" and whether AI art creation deprives human artists of their creative rights.</p>

            <h3>New Approaches to Legal Protection of Intangible Cultural Heritage</h3>
            <p>Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) is a vital part of human culture, but its intangible nature and传承性 pose significant challenges in legal protection. Legal recognition of community rights is the foundation of ICH protection, with communities as the main传承主体应当 having control and usage rights over their cultural expressions. The design of benefit-sharing mechanisms should be based on the value chain of intangible cultural heritage, balancing economic benefits and cultural value protection. International cooperation requires the establishment of a unified legal framework and standards, taking into account cultural diversity and cultural sovereignty, to ensure the global sharing and sustainable development of intangible cultural heritage.</p>

            <h3>Legal Boundaries of Art Criticism and Freedom of Speech</h3>
            <p>Art criticism, as an essential part of the art ecosystem, carries the core value of freedom of speech, but it also faces challenges such as the blurring of boundaries between malicious attacks and legitimate criticism, the anonymity and influence in the online environment, and the tension between art censorship and freedom of expression. The law must balance the protection of freedom of speech and the rights of artists' reputation, clarify the boundaries between "malicious attacks" and "legitimate criticism" in art criticism, regulate behavior in the online environment, and seek a balance between art censorship and freedom of expression, ensuring that artistic freedom aligns with social moral norms.</p>

            <h3>Building an Art Legal Framework for the Digital Age</h3>
            <p>The rise of digital art and the protection of intangible cultural heritage present unprecedented challenges and opportunities for art law. In building an art legal framework for the digital age, we need to consider multiple dimensions of technology, law, and ethics. The law must provide clear rights definitions and protection mechanisms for digital art and intangible cultural heritage while also allowing sufficient flexibility for new technologies. Additionally, the law must be aligned with ethical and social values to ensure the prosperity of digital art and the protection of intangible cultural heritage without compromising artists' rights and social equity.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The rise of digital art and intangible cultural heritage presents unprecedented challenges and opportunities for art law. By constructing an art legal framework adapted to the digital age, we can protect creators' rights while promoting the innovation and development of digital art, ultimately achieving a harmonious coexistence of art and technology. By building a new ecosystem for the legal protection of intangible cultural heritage, we can protect cultural diversity while promoting the innovation and development of intangible cultural heritage, ultimately achieving a harmonious coexistence of culture and law. Art criticism, as an essential part of the art ecosystem, should also be given due attention within the art legal framework. By constructing a framework adapted to the times, we can protect the freedom of art criticism while promoting its innovation and development, ultimately achieving a harmonious coexistence of art criticism and artistic creation, providing a solid legal foundation for the healthy development of the art ecosystem.</p>
