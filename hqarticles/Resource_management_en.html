            <h3>Reverse Thinking: System Reconstruction from Consumption to Regeneration</h3>
            <p>Traditional resource management models focus on optimizing allocation, improving utilization, and reducing waste. "Reverse resource management," on the other hand, thinks backward from the endpoint of resources, constructing a system centered on **regeneration and recycling**.</p>
            <h4>Limitations of Traditional Resource Management Models</h4>
            <p>Traditional resource management models are based on linear economic thinking, with the core being "acquire-use-dispose." While this model can meet human resource needs in the short term, it has several major issues in the long run:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resource Depletion:</strong> Overexploitation of non-renewable resources leads to rapid depletion, threatening future sustainable development.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Pollution:</strong> Improper disposal of waste causes soil, water, and air pollution, affecting ecosystem health.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Costs:</strong> The costs of resource acquisition and waste disposal continue to rise, increasing the economic burden on businesses and society.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Inequality:</strong> Uneven resource distribution exacerbates social inequality, widening the gap between resource-rich and resource-poor regions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Core Concepts of Reverse Thinking</h4>
            <p>Reverse thinking is a problem-solving approach that starts from the result and works backward. In resource management, the core of reverse thinking is shifting from resource consumption to resource regeneration, building a closed-loop resource recycling system. This system includes the following key elements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resource Regeneration:</strong> Through technological innovation and ecological design, transform waste into reusable resources, reducing reliance on virgin resources.</li>
