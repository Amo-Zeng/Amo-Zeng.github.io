            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the era of digital economy, data services are undergoing an unprecedented transformation. This revolution encompasses not only technological innovations but also profoundly impacts social operations, economic development and ecological environments. From the paradigm shift from "data-centric" to "human-centric" approaches, to the crucial role of data services in sustainable development, and the global dynamics of data sovereignty versus decentralization, data services are redefining the relationship between humans, data and society.</p>

            <h3>1. The "Humanization Awakening" of Data: From Mechanical Processing to Intelligent Empowerment</h3>
            <p>Traditional data services have long been constrained by technology-oriented approaches, overemphasizing efficient data processing and storage while neglecting the end-users - human individuals. With advancements in AI, natural language processing (NLP), visualization technologies, and low-threshold APIs, data services are undergoing a fundamental transformation from "cold" technical tools to "warm" decision-making assistants.</p>
            
            <p>Breakthroughs in Explainable Data technologies are accelerating this transition. In high-stakes fields like healthcare and finance, data services are significantly enhancing trustworthiness and practical value through transparent model decision processes. For example, doctors can understand diagnostic model reasoning through explainable AI, while business managers can grasp sales prediction logic via visualization tools. These technological advances have transformed data services from "passive processing" to "active empowerment," becoming intelligent assistants accessible to the general public.</p>

            <h3>2. Green Data Revolution: Digital Technologies Driving Sustainable Development</h3>
            <p>Amid global climate crises and resource depletion, data services are becoming key enablers of green economic transformation.</p>
            
            <h4>[Energy Management Revolution]</h4>
            <p>IBM's "Green Horizon Project" integrates big data and AI for real-time air quality monitoring, precise energy consumption forecasting and intelligent weather analysis, reshaping traditional energy management systems.</p>
            
            <h4>[Carbon Footprint Tracking]</h4>
            <p>Data services are building comprehensive carbon emission monitoring networks. Combining IoT, blockchain and cloud computing enables real-time tracking of corporate, urban and individual carbon footprints. Alibaba Cloud's carbon-neutral data centers, for example, have significantly reduced carbon emissions through intelligent server load and cooling optimization.</p>
            
            <h4>[Smart City Practices]</h4>
            <p>Singapore's intelligent transportation system uses sensor networks and data analytics for smart traffic light control and public transport optimization, effectively reducing congestion and emissions, setting a benchmark for smart cities.</p>
            
            <h4>[Agricultural Innovations]</h4>
            <p>Microsoft's "Farm to Table" project combines AI and satellite data to enable precision irrigation, smart fertilization and optimized pesticide use, improving agricultural efficiency while reducing waste and pollution.</p>
            
            <p>Data services themselves are embracing green principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Energy optimization technologies significantly reduce consumption</li>
                <li>Edge computing minimizes data transmission needs</li>
                <li>Data lifecycle management improves resource utilization</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Tech giants like Google and Amazon have pledged 100% renewable energy for their data centers, leading industry's green transformation.</p>

            <h3>3. The Data Rights Revolution: Sovereignty vs Decentralization in Global Contest</h3>
            <p>As data becomes society's core driver, ownership questions have sparked global debates. Data Sovereignty and Decentralization represent two governance paradigms reshaping data rights.</p>
            
            <h4>[The Rise of Data Sovereignty]</h4>
            <p>Major regional data regulations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>EU: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</li>
                <li>China: Data Security Law & Personal Information Protection Law</li>
                <li>India: Digital India Act</li>
                <li>Russia: Data Localization Policies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These have driven "regional data platform" architectures, strengthening national data control.</p>
            
            <h4>[Decentralization Challenges]</h4>
            <p>Emerging technologies bringing change:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blockchain: Reshaping ownership via distributed ledgers</li>
                <li>IPFS & Filecoin: Building decentralized storage</li>
                <li>Federated Learning: Enabling AI modeling without data transfer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These disrupt centralized monopolies but pose regulatory challenges.</p>
            
            <p>Future governance may adopt "hybrid sovereignty" models balancing legal compliance with cross-border data sharing. Federated learning combined with trusted computing offers new solutions for compliant AI collaboration.</p>

            <h3>4. The Future of Data Services: Balancing and Integrating Multiple Values</h3>
            <p>Future data services will evolve in multiple dimensions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Technology: From "tool-based" to "intelligence-based"</li>
                <li>Society: From "data-driven" to "value-driven"</li>
                <li>Economy: From "efficiency-first" to "sustainability-focused"</li>
                <li>Governance: From "centralized" to "multi-centered"</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This transformation redefines data's role: not just as digital economy's core resource, but as key to human development, planetary protection and rights reconfiguration. Enterprises, governments and individuals must all adapt to steer data services toward more human-centric, sustainable and equitable directions.</p>
            
            <p>Fundamental questions of data ownership will determine the digital era's future order and direction. Finding equilibrium between technological innovation, social values and individual rights represents humanity's greatest challenge - and opportunity - in the digital age.</p>
