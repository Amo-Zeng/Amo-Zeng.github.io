            <h2>Introduction: The Digital Distribution Revolution — When Traditional Theories Fail</h2>
            <p>
                Today, as platform economies deepen their integration, global value chains restructure, and artificial intelligence rapidly evolves, income distribution is no longer a matter of simple "wealth gaps" or "tax adjustments." Traditional economic frameworks centered on <strong>employment relations, hourly wages, and geographic specialization</strong> are being upended by a new "digital distribution revolution." Users have become "prosumers," skills are topologically distributed, time has become capital, and cognition has become an asset. Against this backdrop, we propose a <strong>three-dimensional theoretical framework</strong>—anchored in <strong>cognitive capital</strong> (value capture in the platform economy), <strong>skill topology</strong> (technology-institution coupling in the global value chain), and <strong>temporal capital</strong> (cognitive depreciation across generations)—to reveal the systemic mechanisms of income distribution reconstruction in the digital age.
            </p>
            <p>
                These three dimensions are not isolated; they are deeply nested and mutually reinforcing, shaping an unprecedented structure of inequality: a reinforcing cycle of <strong>platform exploitation—global lock-in—intergenerational entrapment</strong>. The fundamental reason traditional distribution theories fail is their inability to grasp the <strong>deep transformation in the logic of value creation</strong> in the digital era:
                <br>• Labor shifts from "physical input" to "cognitive output";
                <br>• Capital shifts from "material accumulation" to "control over data and attention";
                <br>• Time shifts from "linear consumption" to a "productive resource" that is investable, depreciable, and redistributable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only by understanding this three-dimensional revolution can we escape the dual traps of "technological determinism" and "institutional fatalism," and move toward genuine <strong>digital justice</strong>—a new distributive order that recognizes cognitive value, ensures skill mobility, and respects the dignity of time.

            <h2>Part I: Cognitive Capital Premium and Attention Rent — The Value Capture Mechanism in the Platform Economy</h2>
            <p>
                The rise of the platform economy marks the emergence of a new value capture mechanism: the <strong>cognitive capital premium</strong>. Under this mechanism, users are no longer mere consumers or laborers but <strong>prosumers</strong>—they continuously contribute <strong>attention, emotional labor, social capital, and data assets</strong> to platforms through content creation, social interaction, and behavioral feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                Platforms quantify immaterial labor via algorithms into metrics such as watch time, completion rates, engagement rates, and follower growth curves, transforming these into "attention flows" that are then commodified as "traffic assets." This process generates <strong>attention rent</strong>—the platform's <strong>extraction of surplus value</strong> from users' cognitive labor. Its essence: platforms acquire high-density cognitive output from users at near-zero cost, then resell it to advertisers, brands, and capital markets at premium prices—a practice we call <strong>cognitive arbitrage</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Platforms achieve "non-employment exploitation" through <strong>algorithmic power</strong>:
                <br>• <strong>Labor de-subjectification</strong>: User labor is broken down into algorithm-optimizable "behavioral units" like "likes," "shares," and "comments";
                <br>• <strong>Unequal returns</strong>: Platforms capture over 90% of traffic revenue, while creators receive only fragmented tips or ad shares;
                <br>• <strong>Risk externalization</strong>: Compliance, emotional exhaustion, and psychological anxiety are borne by users;
                <br>• <strong>Algorithmic opacity</strong>: Distribution rules are non-transparent, turning users into "digital tenants" trapped in a cycle of "effort—exposure—harvesting."
            </p>
            <p>
                A classic case is the Douyin (TikTok) ecosystem: the top 1% of creators capture 90% of traffic and income, while 90% of "long-tail creators" earn less than ¥10 per day. Platforms use algorithms to create a "Matthew effect," converting most users' cognitive labor into <strong>free data fuel</strong>, while paying a premium only to a few "algorithmically selected" individuals—this is the very essence of the <strong>cognitive capital premium</strong>: platforms reward individuals with high "attention conversion capacity" identified by algorithmic filtering.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                More profoundly, this distribution structure creates <strong>participatory inequality</strong>: high-traffic creators gain social influence, forming a "cognitive hegemony"; the silent majority, though contributing data, lack channels for voice. Platforms have become new <strong>cognitive infrastructures</strong>—whoever controls traffic, controls interpretation. As sociologist Byung-Chul Han observes: "In the digital panopticon, we voluntarily become observed prisoners, merely to obtain the illusion of being seen."
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Part II: Skill Topology Differentiation and Global Stratification — Spatial-Skill Asymmetry under Technology-Institution Coupling</h2>
            <p>
                Driven by the dual forces of global value chain (GVC) division of labor and technological change, the geographic logic of income distribution is being reshaped by <strong>skill topology differentiation</strong>. Traditional "core-periphery" theories, based on geographic space, fail to explain today's non-linear, asymmetric transnational income stratification. We introduce the concept of <strong>skill topology differentiation</strong>—the way countries' positions in the GVC couple with frontier technologies (e.g., AI, automation), creating a topological structure of <strong>high-skill enclaves</strong> and <strong>low-skill lock-in</strong> across space, organization, and social structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Spatial asymmetry</strong>: High-skill jobs cluster in global innovation hubs (Silicon Valley, Shenzhen, Bangalore), while low-skill service jobs are "decentralized" in peripheral cities. For example, AI R&D is concentrated in San Francisco, while data labeling is outsourced to Indonesia and Kenya—creating a "brain-limb" spatial split. This <strong>geographic decoupling</strong> prevents even diffusion of technological dividends.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Organizational asymmetry</strong>: High-skilled workers are embedded in <strong>elastic innovation networks</strong>, enjoying autonomy, intellectual property, and career pathways; low-skilled workers are locked into <strong>platform-controlled organizations</strong>, where labor is algorithmically decomposed and performance quantified, depriving them of bargaining power and skill accumulation. For instance, Amazon warehouse workers and Google AI engineers, though both in the "tech ecosystem," occupy vastly different positions in the skill topology.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Skill structure asymmetry</strong>: High skills emphasize "cognitive flexibility" and "system integration" (e.g., interdisciplinary modeling, algorithmic ethics), while low skills rely on "procedural execution" and "emotional labor" (e.g., customer service scripts, emotional management). This divergence is not about skill levels, but about <strong>the position of skills within technological systems</strong>—the former are "designers," the latter "executors."
            </p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Institutional resilience</strong> acts as a "filter" for technology diffusion and an "amplifier" of income stratification:
                <br>• <strong>China's manufacturing upgrade</strong>: "New whole-nation system" drives "intelligent manufacturing," but the education system remains exam-oriented, creating a "skills gap during technological catch-up";
                <br>• <strong>India's IT outsourcing</strong>: Leverages English advantage and low-cost engineers to become a global software hub, but lax labor policies trap it in a "middle-skills trap";
                <br>• <strong>U.S. AI R&D</strong>: Built on elite universities and venture capital, forming a "technological enclave," but high education costs exacerbate domestic income polarization.
            </div>
            <p>
                Global inequality is no longer a linear gap between nations, but a <strong>multi-dimensional stratification within the skill topology network</strong>: high-skilled groups form transnational "global innovation classes," while low-skilled groups are locally locked as "regional labor reserves." This <strong>skill topology divide</strong> allows technological dividends to be captured by a few nodes, trapping peripheral regions in "digital dependency."
            </p>

            <h2>Part III: Temporal Capital Imbalance and Intergenerational Fracture — Lifetime Income Dynamics under Aging and AI Acceleration</h2>
            <p>
                Under the dual waves of population aging and rapid AI evolution, traditional models based on "static lifetime income" face fundamental challenges. When the population over 65 exceeds 14%, and AI models double in capability every 18 months, workers' "cognitive assets" no longer accumulate linearly, but exhibit <strong>generationally heterogeneous depreciation patterns</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Cognitive depreciation rate</strong> refers to the speed at which an individual's existing skills rapidly lose value in the face of technological change, due to aging, declining neuroplasticity, slower information processing, and reduced learning motivation. This rate <strong>rises exponentially with age</strong>. Young workers (20–35) are at cognitive peak, with "high temporal capital elasticity"; older workers (45+) face a triple challenge:
                <br>1. <strong>Reduced neuroplasticity</strong>: Slower learning, longer skill acquisition cycles;
                <br>2. <strong>Higher opportunity costs</strong>: Time capital for retraining is squeezed by family, mortgages, and health;
                <br>3. <strong>Increased psychological inertia</strong>: Long-term career path dependence creates cognitive lock-in, making paradigm shifts difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Temporal capital</strong> is the "non-productive time" individuals can invest in skill development, career exploration, and network rebuilding. Its distribution is highly intergenerationally imbalanced:
                <br>• <strong>Youth</strong>: Time capital is relatively abundant, but face "fast-cycle" careers with skill half-lives of 2–3 years, creating a "high-depreciation—high-investment" consumptive model;
                <br>• <strong>Mid-career</strong>: Time capital is constrained by family and debt, with short retraining windows and high transition costs;
                <br>• <strong>Elderly</strong>: Time capital is nearly depleted, digital divides deepen, leading to "technology-dependent poverty."
            </p>
            <p>
                The traditional assumption that "income rises monotonically with tenure" no longer holds. Instead, workers aged 45–55 may face an "income cliff" due to skill gaps, while those under 30 may experience "non-linear income leaps" through AI empowerment. For example, a 50-year-old traditional engineer who fails to learn Python or ML may see stagnant wages, while a 25-year-old AI trainer, with rapid learning, could double income in three years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Worse, <strong>intergenerational fracture</strong> is emerging: parents' "industrial-era skills" cannot transfer to children, while children's required "digital-native competencies" lack systematic cultivation. This <strong>temporal capital gap</strong> erodes intergenerational mobility, deepening social entrapment.
            </p>

            <h2>Part IV: Three-Dimensional Nesting and Systemic Risk — The Reinforcing Cycle of "Platform Exploitation—Global Lock-In—Intergenerational Entrapment"</h2>
            <p>
                The three dimensions are not isolated; they form a <strong>mutually nested, mutually reinforcing systemic cycle</strong>, constructing a "digital inequality ecosystem":
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Platform Exploitation → Global Lock-In</strong>:
                    <br>Platforms commodify user attention via algorithms, creating "cognitive capital premiums," but their underlying data depends on global low-skilled workers (e.g., Southeast Asian data labelers, African content moderators). These workers are locked into platform-controlled organizations, unable to transfer skills, becoming "global digital laborers"—the <strong>global extension of platform exploitation</strong>. For example, Meta's content moderators in Kenya earn under $300/month but endure intense psychological stress.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Global Lock-In → Intergenerational Entrapment</strong>:
                    <br>Developing-country workers, due to weak institutional resilience (e.g., education-job mismatch, poor labor protection), struggle to convert technological dividends into skill upgrades, falling into a "low-skills trap." Their children grow up in digital divides, lacking quality digital education, further accelerating intergenerational cognitive depreciation—creating a <strong>poverty of cognitive intergenerational transmission</strong>. The "digital starting line" gap between rural Indian children and Silicon Valley elites is evolving into a "cognitive generational chasm."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Intergenerational Entrapment → Platform Exploitation</strong>:
                    <br>Middle-aged and older workers, facing high cognitive depreciation, are pushed into platform economies (e.g., delivery riders, ride-hailing drivers), where their "temporal capital" is optimized by algorithms, maximizing labor intensity while stagnating income. Platforms use "flexible employment" to evade responsibility, creating "<strong>elderly digital tenants</strong>"—the <strong>age-dimensional expansion of platform exploitation</strong>. For example, the share of China's ride-hailing drivers over 60 is rising, with average daily work exceeding 12 hours.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <blockquote>
                More dangerously, this cycle is <strong>accelerating technological monopolization</strong>: platforms accumulate user behavior data, global skill distribution maps, and intergenerational learning curves as core production assets, further entrenching their distributive dominance. <strong>Who controls data, controls distribution</strong>. Algorithms are not just tools—they are <strong>apparatuses of power</strong>.

            <h2>Part V: Regulatory Pathways — Institutional Innovation toward the Trinity of "Cognitive Justice, Skill Redistribution, and Temporal Capital Reinvestment"</h2>
            <p>
                To break this cycle, we must build a trinity of regulatory mechanisms, shifting from "traffic distribution" to "capability distribution":
            </p>
            <h3>1. Cognitive Justice (Platform Dimension)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recognition of cognitive labor</strong>: Establish a "data contribution rights" system, granting users revenue-sharing rights over their generated data, as in the EU's Digital Markets Act's "data portability";</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic transparency</strong>: Mandate platforms to disclose core algorithm parameters (e.g., traffic allocation, revenue calculation), establishing "algorithmic audits";</li>
                <li><strong>Platform revenue sharing</strong>: Explore "digital labor dividends," allocating a share of ad revenue to a "Cognitive Laborers' Fund";</li>
                <li><strong>Antitrust expansion</strong>: Extend antitrust regulation to include platform monopolies over attention and data, preventing the formation of "cognitive cartels."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Skill Redistribution (Global Dimension)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Skill redistribution systems</strong>: Promote "lifelong learning accounts," cross-industry skill certification, and industry-university joint training, establishing "skill banks";</li>
                <li><strong>Institutional coordination reform</strong>: Developing countries must strengthen labor protection and reform education; developed countries should assume "skill spillover responsibility";</li>
                <li><strong>Global digital governance</strong>: Establish transnational data taxes, algorithmic transparency standards, and digital labor rights conventions, embedding the principle of "skill justice," as in the UN's Global Digital Compact initiative.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Temporal Capital Reinvestment (Intergenerational Dimension)</h3>

            <h2>Conclusion: From "Traffic Distribution" to "Digital Justice" — Global Governance in the Digital Age</h2>
            <p>
                Income distribution in the digital age has shifted from "wealth distribution" to <strong>capability distribution</strong>, and from "geographic competition" to <strong>cognitive competition</strong>. Attention rent in the platform economy, skill topology differentiation in the global value chain, and temporal capital imbalance across generations collectively form a systemic inequality structure. The challenge ahead is not just technological, but <strong>institutional</strong>: Can we build a new distributive order that recognizes cognitive labor, ensures equitable skill mobility, and guarantees reinvestment in temporal capital?
            </p>
            <div class="conclusion">
                Only by advancing the trinity of <strong>cognitive justice, skill redistribution, and temporal capital reinvestment</strong> can we break the vicious cycle of "platform exploitation—global lock-in—intergenerational entrapment." This is not merely an economic issue, but the <strong>reconstruction of the social contract in the digital age</strong>. Amid globalization, digitization, and aging, we urgently need a global dialogue on <strong>digital justice</strong>—from "traffic distribution" to "cognitive distribution," from "technological hegemony" to "human dignity."
                <br><br>
                <strong>Justice should not merely redistribute wealth, but also empower cognition, skills, and time.</strong>
