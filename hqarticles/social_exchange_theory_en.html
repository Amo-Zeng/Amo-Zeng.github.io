            <h2>Multidimensional Exploration of Social Exchange Theory: The Convergence of the Digital Age, Intimate Relationships, and Social Capital</h2>
            <p>The Social Exchange Theory (SET), founded by George C. Homans and further developed by scholars such as Peter M. Blau, has gradually become a core theoretical framework for analyzing interpersonal interactions, resource distribution, and power dynamics. The central idea of SET is that individuals satisfy their needs through the exchange of resources (such as information, emotions, economic support) during social interactions, thereby constructing complex power structures and value systems. With profound social transformations, especially the rapid development of digital technology, the application scenarios of SET have extended from traditional interpersonal interactions to multiple dimensions such as the digital age, intimate relationships, and social capital. This article aims to integrate research in these fields, delve into the manifestations and theoretical extensions of SET in different social contexts, and reveal its broad applicability and profound explanatory power in modern society.</p>

            <h3>I. Social Exchange in the Digital Age: Algorithms, Attention Economy, and Value Reconstruction</h3>
            <p>The advent of the digital age has completely disrupted the forms and content of social exchange. Algorithms, data analysis, and the attention economy have become the core driving forces of social exchange in the new era, reshaping the modes of information acquisition, resource distribution, and value exchange.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Algorithm-mediated social exchange</strong>: On digital platforms, algorithms serve as important intermediaries in social exchange, not only determining the information users can access but also profoundly influencing their social interactions and value identification.</li>
                <li><strong>Exchange patterns under the attention economy</strong>: In the digital age, the attention economy treats users' attention as a scarce resource, leading to profound changes in the exchange relationships among platforms, content creators, and users.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital labor and value reconstruction</strong>: With the普及 of digital technology, forms of digital labor such as user-generated content (UGC) and data contribution have gradually become important components of social exchange, driving the reconstruction of value systems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Social Exchange Theory and Emotional Labor: Value Exchange and Power Dynamics in Intimate Relationships</h3>
            <p>Emotional labor refers to the expression, regulation, and support of emotions by individuals in intimate relationships to meet their partners' emotional needs. Social exchange theory provides a framework for understanding the exchange mechanisms of emotional investment, emotional return, and power dynamics in intimate relationships.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quantification and exchange of emotional labor</strong>: Emotional labor can be seen as a resource, similar to time, energy, and emotional support. In intimate relationships, the quantification of emotional labor can be assessed through time investment, energy consumption, and the frequency and quality of emotional support.</li>
                <li><strong>Exchange inequality in intimate relationships</strong>: Although the exchange of emotional labor is ideally reciprocal, in reality, unequal exchange often occurs, leading to emotional exploitation and neglect.</li>
                <li><strong>Gender and emotional labor exchange</strong>: Gender roles play a significant role in the distribution and exchange of emotional labor. Traditional gender roles suggest that women are more adept at emotional labor, so in intimate relationships, women often bear more emotional labor responsibilities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>III. Social Exchange Theory and Social Capital: Resource Exchange and Power Dynamics in Network Relationships</h3>
            <p>The theory of social capital posits that social capital is the collection of resources individuals obtain through social network relationships. Social exchange theory provides an important perspective for understanding resource exchange, power dynamics, and social capital accumulation in network relationships.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accumulation and exchange of social capital</strong>: The accumulation of social capital depends on an individual's position in the social network and the strength of relationships. By establishing and maintaining social relationships, individuals can obtain resources such as information, opportunities, and support from the network.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource exchange in network relationships: Weak ties vs. Strong ties</strong>: Different types of network relationships (such as weak ties vs. strong ties, online vs. offline relationships) exhibit significant differences in resource exchange patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Power dynamics and exchange mechanisms in network relationships</strong>: In network relationships, the core of power dynamics lies in resource control. Individuals who possess more resources or control over specific resources hold an advantageous position in the exchange process.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Social Exchange Theory demonstrates its powerful explanatory power and application potential in multiple fields such as the digital age, intimate relationships, and social capital. Through the exploration of algorithm-mediated social exchange, exchange patterns under the attention economy, and the reconstruction of digital labor and value, we see the adaptability of social exchange theory in addressing challenges of the digital age. The quantification and exchange of emotional labor, exchange inequality, and the influence of gender roles on emotional labor exchange further reveal the complex interactions and power dynamics in intimate relationships. The accumulation and exchange of social capital, resource exchange, and power dynamics in network relationships provide theoretical support for understanding resource distribution and power dynamics in broader social networks.</p>
