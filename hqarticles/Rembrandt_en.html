            <h3>Rembrandt's Use of Light and Shadow and Its Psychological Significance</h3>
            <p>Rembrandt is renowned for his masterful use of light and shadow, which is particularly prominent in his works. He often uses contrast between light and dark to highlight the subject, creating a dramatic effect. This technique not only enhances the visual impact but also reflects Rembrandt's deep understanding of human emotions and psychological states.</p>
            <p>In Rembrandt's works, light is often used to symbolize hope, revelation, or inner light. For example, in his masterpiece "The Night Watch," light enters from the left side of the painting, illuminating the faces and actions of the figures, creating a tense and mysterious atmosphere. This contrast of light and shadow not only increases the drama of the scene but also reflects Rembrandt's understanding of the complexity of human nature. The use of light is not just a technical skill but also a profound psychological insight.</p>
            <p>From a psychological perspective, Rembrandt's use of light and shadow can be seen as a form of projection, where external light and shadow are used to express inner emotions and psychological states. This technique allows the viewer to more intuitively feel the emotional fluctuations and inner world of the figures in the painting. Through the changes in light and shadow, Rembrandt externalizes the inner world of the figures into visual effects, allowing the viewer to gain a deeper understanding of their emotions and psychological states.</p>

            <h3>Color Selection and Emotional Expression</h3>
            <p>Rembrandt's choice of colors also has deep psychological significance. He often uses warm tones to express the emotions and inner world of the figures. For example, in his "The Jewish Bride," the use of warm tones not only adds warmth to the scene but also conveys a sense of intimacy and warmth.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Rembrandt is skilled at using color contrast to enhance emotional expression. For example, in his "Revelation" series, he uses deep, cool tones to express the terror and despair of the end times, while in "The Return of the Prodigal Son," he uses soft, warm tones to express repentance and hope.</p>
            <p>Through this color selection, Rembrandt not only depicts external scenes but also expresses inner emotions and psychological states. This use of color gives his works greater emotional depth and psychological layers. The changes in color are not just visual contrasts but also emotional contrasts, allowing Rembrandt to externalize the inner world of the figures into visual effects, enabling the viewer to gain a deeper understanding of their emotions and psychological states.</p>

            <h3>Rembrandt's Self-Portraits: Self-Reflection and Psychological Exploration</h3>
            <p>Rembrandt's self-portraits are an important part of his artistic creation. Through these self-portraits, we can see Rembrandt's deep self-reflection and psychological exploration. His self-portraits are not just depictions of his appearance but also revelations of his inner world.</p>
            <p>In his self-portraits, Rembrandt often uses the contrast between light and dark to emphasize his facial expressions and emotional states. For example, in "Self-Portrait" (1659), his face is illuminated by light while the background is shrouded in shadow, which not only increases the drama of the scene but also reflects Rembrandt's deep exploration of his inner world.</p>
            <p>From a psychological perspective, Rembrandt's self-portraits can be seen as a form of self-projection, using self-portraits to express inner emotions and psychological states. This self-reflection and psychological exploration give Rembrandt's self-portraits deep emotional depth and psychological layers. Through his self-portraits, Rembrandt not only demonstrates his superb artistic skills but also reflects the diversity and complexity of society at that time through his deep self-reflection.</p>

            <h4>Economic Prosperity of the Dutch Golden Age and Rembrandt's Art</h4>
            <p>In the 17th century, particularly in Amsterdam where Rembrandt lived, the Netherlands was experiencing the economic prosperity of the Dutch Golden Age.
