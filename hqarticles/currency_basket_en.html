            <h3>Merging Ecological Economics with Monetary Policy</h3>
            <p>The core of ecological economics is the harmonious coexistence of economic activities with the natural environment, requiring monetary policy to not only focus on economic growth but also promote environmental protection and sustainable development.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Green Currency:</strong> Design one or more currencies whose value is directly linked to environmental projects like renewable energy investments, green technology R&D.</li>
                <li><strong>Investment Incentives:</strong> Use monetary policy tools like low-interest loans or tax incentives to encourage investment in sustainable projects.</li>
                <li><strong>Internalizing Environmental Costs:</strong> Adjust monetary values to incorporate environmental costs into economic decisions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Innovative Role of Blockchain Technology</h3>
            <p>Blockchain technology, with its decentralization, transparency, and immutability, provides an innovative solution for the management of currency baskets:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Decentralized Management:</strong> Blockchain allows for the creation of a global, decentralized currency basket.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> Automatically adjust the proportions of currencies in the basket via smart contracts.</li>
                <li><strong>Increase Transaction Efficiency and Security:</strong> Blockchain technology can reduce intermediary steps in cross-border payments, lowering transaction costs.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Interaction of Cultural Values with Currency Baskets</h3>
            <p>Currency is not just a tool for economic transactions but also a carrier of cultural values. The design of currency baskets should reflect the economic values and social structures of different cultures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weight Allocation and Cultural Sensitivity:</strong> Consider different cultural perceptions and uses of money.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Symbols and Education:</strong> Include currencies with cultural significance in the basket.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Diplomacy and Cultural Exchange:</strong> Adjust the currency basket to facilitate economic diplomacy between nations.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Implementation Effects and Challenges</h3>
            <p>Introducing this new type of currency basket requires global cooperation and faces technical implementation challenges like performance bottlenecks in high-frequency trading and the need for data accuracy.</p>

            <h3>Future Outlook</h3>
            <p>By integrating principles of ecological economics, blockchain technology, and cultural values into the design of currency baskets, we can create a more inclusive, transparent, and sustainable global financial system. This integration is not just an innovation in financial tools but a profound transformation of the global economic ecosystem.</p>
