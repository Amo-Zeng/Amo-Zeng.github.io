            <h2>Water Pollution Management: Global Perspectives and Deep Challenges</h2>
            <p>Water pollution has become a global issue, but its causes, impacts, and response strategies vary by region, presenting diverse management needs and challenges.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>1. Developed Countries: Industrial Legacy and Emerging Pollution</h3>
            <p>During industrialization, developed countries faced severe water pollution issues, such as industrial discharges in London's Thames River and Detroit River. After long-term management, water quality has improved, but industrial pollution and chemical residues still pose threats, as seen in the Flint water crisis in Michigan. Additionally, emerging pollutants—microplastics, pharmaceuticals, and personal care product residues—present new challenges to water bodies. Developed countries need to strengthen emission standards, monitoring technologies, and public education to address these complex issues.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>2. Developing Countries: Domestic Sewage and Agricultural Non-Point Source Pollution</h3>
            <p>Developing countries face more severe water pollution challenges, primarily from domestic sewage and agricultural non-point source pollution. The pollution in India's Ganges River is a typical example; agricultural runoff containing fertilizers, pesticides, and livestock waste causes eutrophication, triggering algal blooms and oxygen depletion. These countries urgently need to enhance sewage treatment facilities, promote ecological agriculture, and improve public environmental awareness to break the pollution cycle.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>3. Less Developed Areas: Resource Scarcity and Vicious Cycle of Pollution</h3>
            <p>In less developed areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, lack of clean water sources forces residents to use polluted river water, exacerbating disease transmission and water resource pollution. These regions require international aid to construct basic water infrastructure and conduct training in water resource management and protection to break the vicious cycle of resource scarcity and pollution.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Global Cooperation: Addressing Transboundary Pollution and Technology Sharing</h3>
            <p>Water pollution management requires global cooperation. Developed countries should provide technological and financial support to developing countries to enhance their management capabilities. The international community needs to establish stricter water pollution control standards and address transboundary pollution issues. Global cooperation not only facilitates technology sharing but also promotes policy coordination, forming a collaborative global network for management.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Regional Differences: Tailored Management Strategies</h3>
            <p>Different regions have varying causes, levels of pollution, and management capabilities, requiring targeted management measures. Developed countries should focus on emerging pollutants and industrial pollution management, while developing countries need to strengthen sewage treatment facilities and agricultural non-point source pollution control. Less developed areas require international assistance to break the vicious cycle of water resource scarcity and pollution.</p>

            <h2>The Profound Impact of Water Pollution on Ecosystems: In-Depth Analysis and Response Strategies</h2>
            <p>The long-term impacts of water pollution on ecosystems are complex and profound, threatening biodiversity and disrupting ecological balance, posing severe challenges to Earth's life support systems.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>1. Loss of Biodiversity: Degradation of Ecosystem Functions</h3>
            <p>Water pollution leads to the loss of biodiversity, not only reducing species numbers but also degrading ecosystem functions. For example, water pollution in the Yangtze River basin has caused the extinction of endemic fish species, which not only affects fishery resources but also weakens the stability of the entire river basin ecosystem.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>2. Disruption of Food Chains: Ecological Chain Reactions</h3>
            <p>Pollutants are transmitted through food chains, causing chain reactions. Mercury pollution in the Baltic Sea has led to a decline in the reproductive ability of seabirds and seals, disrupting the balance of the marine ecosystem. This bio-amplification effect reveals the profound impact of pollutants on higher trophic level organisms.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>3. Habitat Degradation: Loss of Ecosystem Functions</h3>
            <p>Water pollution causes the degradation of habitats such as wetlands, destroying ecosystem functions. The eutrophication problem in Lake Taihu has led to cyanobacterial blooms, resulting in the degradation of wetland ecosystems. Many waterbirds and fish have lost their habitats, affecting the stability of the lake ecosystem.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>4. Disruption of Ecological Balance: Species Replacement and Adaptive Changes</h3>
            <p>Water pollution alters species competition relationships, leading to the disruption of ecological balance. Pollution in the Thames River in the UK has caused the proliferation of pollution-tolerant species and the disappearance of sensitive species, changing the ecological structure of the river and affecting the ecosystem services of the watershed.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>5. Groundwater Pollution: Covert and Profound Impact</h3>
            <p>Groundwater pollution poses a long-term threat to ecosystems and human health. The groundwater pollution problem in Northern Mexico has been transmitted through the food chain, eventually affecting human health, revealing the covert and widespread impact of groundwater pollution.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Response Strategies: Integrated Management and Ecological Restoration</h3>
            <p>Addressing the long-term impacts of water pollution requires integrated management and ecological restoration strategies. Strengthening source control to reduce pollutant emissions; conducting ecological restoration to recover damaged ecosystems; enhancing monitoring and research to formulate scientifically sound protection measures are key to addressing the long-term impacts of water pollution.</p>
