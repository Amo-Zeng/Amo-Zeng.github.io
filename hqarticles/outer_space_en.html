            <h2>The Potential and Insights of Space Ecosystems</h2>
            <p>The concept of space ecosystems is based on Earth's ecological environment, exploring the possibility of life existing and evolving on other planets or satellites. Scientists are focusing on celestial bodies like Mars and Europa, which have ancient oceans that may provide the basic conditions for life, such as liquid water and essential chemical elements.</p>
            <p>If we find microorganisms in space and these life forms evolve following natural selection similar to Darwin's theory, it would offer a new perspective on understanding the essence of life. The hypothesis of panspermia provides theoretical support for the possibility of interstellar life dissemination.</p>

            <h2>The Rise of Space Culture and the Deep Integration of Sociology</h2>
            <p>Human exploration of space not only drives technological advancements but also gives rise to new cultural trends. The themes of alien civilizations and interstellar adventures inspire us to rethink the meaning of our existence.</p>
            <p>Space exploration has profound impacts on global politics and social structures. International cooperation has become the main theme, with the construction of the International Space Station being a model of multinational collaboration.</p>

            <h2>The Space Resource Economy: Unlocking Potential and Facing Challenges</h2>
            <p>On Earth, where resources are increasingly scarce, the space resource economy shows tremendous potential. The abundant minerals on asteroids and the moon, along with renewable energy like solar power, paint a picture of a resource-rich landscape.</p>
            <p>However, developing space resources faces numerous technical, legal, and economic challenges. The technical barriers to large-scale development have not been completely overcome, and the massive investments coupled with uncertain economic returns increase the risk.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Space exploration is no longer the domain of a few countries or elites, but a shared mission for all humanity towards the future. Only through interdisciplinary dialogue and global collaboration can we navigate towards a brilliant new space era.</p>
