            <h2>Governance Challenges: How to Build a Sustainable Rural Social Governance System under Ecological Agriculture Model?</h2>
            <p>Ecological agriculture, as a new agricultural model emphasizing environmental protection, sustainable resource use, and social equity, is gradually transforming the traditional rural social governance landscape. The promotion of ecological agriculture not only brings new economic models, interest patterns, and social relationships but also poses new challenges and requirements for rural social governance. How to build a sustainable rural social governance system under the ecological agriculture model has become an urgent and important issue to be addressed.</p>

            <h3>Governance Challenges under Ecological Agriculture Model</h3>
            <p>The implementation of the ecological agriculture model brings various challenges, mainly manifested in the balance between economic development and environmental protection, the adjustment of the interest pattern, and the realization of social equity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balance between Economic Development and Environmental Protection:</strong> Ecological agriculture requires balancing economic and ecological benefits during production, necessitating finding a balance point in planning production and environmental protection measures. For instance, scientifically planning land use, water resource management, and the use of pesticides and fertilizers to ensure that production activities do not negatively impact the environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjustment of Interest Patterns:</strong> The promotion of ecological agriculture changes traditional agricultural production models, bringing new interest patterns. Farmers need to adapt to new cooperative models, actively participate in ecological agriculture projects, and obtain fair shares in the interest distribution.</li>
                <li><strong>Realization of Social Equity:</strong> Ecological agriculture emphasizes social equity, particularly the interests of vulnerable groups. Establishing sound social equity mechanisms to ensure the legitimate rights and interests of all farmers are safeguarded during project implementation is a significant challenge.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Building a Sustainable Rural Social Governance System</h3>
            <p>Under the ecological agriculture model, building a sustainable rural social governance system requires comprehensive consideration of economic development, environmental protection, and social equity. Here are some key measures:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Develop Scientific Production Planning:</strong> Based on local ecological environment and resource conditions, formulate scientific production methods and environmental protection measures to ensure sustainable agricultural development.</li>
                <li><strong>Establish Cooperative Mechanisms:</strong> Promote cooperation and sharing among farmers through cooperative organizations such as farmer cooperatives and ecological agriculture associations, ensuring fair distribution of interests.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthen Social Equity Mechanisms:</strong> Include interest distribution mechanisms, rescue mechanisms, and supervision mechanisms to ensure fair distribution of farmers' interests, with special attention to the needs of vulnerable groups.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Synergistic Cooperation among Government, Enterprises, and Farmers</h3>
            <p>Under the ecological agriculture model, the collaborative cooperation among the government, enterprises, and farmers is crucial for achieving sustainable rural social governance. The three parties should work together to establish sound legal, policy, and social service systems related to ecological agriculture.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Establish Legal and Regulatory Systems:</strong> The government needs to establish sound legal and regulatory systems to ensure the smooth implementation of ecological agriculture, such as enacting the "Ecological Agriculture Promotion Law" and the "Environmental Protection Law."</li>
                <li><strong>Provide Social Services:</strong> Governments and social organizations should provide comprehensive social services to support the development of ecological agriculture, such as technical support, market information services, and financial services.</li>
                <li><strong>Corporate Social Responsibility:</strong> Enterprises should take on social responsibility, actively participate in the development of ecological agriculture, such as investing in ecological agriculture projects, providing technical support, and participating in social services.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Rural social governance under the ecological agriculture model faces new challenges and opportunities. By formulating scientific production planning, establishing cooperative mechanisms, and strengthening social equity mechanisms, sustainable rural social governance under the ecological agriculture model can be achieved. At the same time, the collaborative cooperation among the government, enterprises, and farmers is key to achieving sustainable rural social governance. In the future, as ecological agriculture deepens, rural social governance will focus more on environmental protection, social equity, and sustainable development, realizing the goal of rural revitalization.</p>
