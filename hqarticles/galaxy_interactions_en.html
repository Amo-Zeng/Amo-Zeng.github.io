                <p>On the grand stage of the universe, galaxies do not exist in isolation. They attract, collide, and merge with one another, forming a complex and intricate "social network." This network is not maintained through language or information exchange, but through gravity, dark matter, and the flow of gas. Galactic interactions are not merely material exchanges but also a transmission of "evolutionary genes." We might poetically call this—a "genetic engineering" project spanning billions of light-years. It is through these cosmic "collisions and mergers" that galaxies, as if possessing life, undergo processes of "inheritance" and "evolution."</p>

                <h3>Prologue: The Analogy from Biological DNA to Galactic DNA</h3>
                <p>If we consider biological DNA as the blueprint that determines an organism's traits and evolutionary potential, then on a cosmic scale, a similar "galactic DNA" quietly plays its role. This isn't actual genetic code but rather a set of measurable astrophysical parameters: the age distribution of stellar populations, metallicity (heavy element content), angular momentum, dust distribution, and even the mass and activity of black holes. These parameters, like a galaxy's "genome," are "read," "recombined," and even "edited" during galactic interactions.</p>

                <h3>Galactic "Social Behavior": Gravity as the Bridge of Communication</h3>
                <p>Galactic "social behavior" begins with gravity. This fundamental cosmic force not only draws galaxies closer in space but also generates intense tidal effects and structural disturbances. Their interactions are not simple "collisions" but rather a "cosmic dance"—a gravitational interplay lasting millions or even billions of years.</p>
                <p>In these interactions, gravitational tugs between gas clouds trigger "baby booms" of star formation and stretch out spectacular "galactic arms" and "stellar streams." These phenomena not only alter a galaxy's appearance but, more importantly, transmit the "genes" of stellar populations—young stars and metal-rich gas clouds are injected into new galaxies, becoming seeds of evolution.</p>

                <h3>Dark Matter: The Invisible "Information Mediator"</h3>
                <p>Behind galactic interactions, dark matter functions like "neural signals." Although dark matter itself doesn't emit or interact with light, its gravitational framework maintains the skeleton of galaxies. During galactic mergers, dark matter halos act as "carriers of hidden information," encoding the future orbits, velocities, and even destinies of galaxies.</p>
                <p>Astronomical simulations reveal that the uneven distribution of dark matter determines which galaxies merge, when they merge, and the resulting stable structures. Much like regulatory sequences in DNA control gene expression, dark matter plays the role of a "genetic regulator" in galactic evolution.</p>

                <h3>Social Alliances: The Formation of Galaxy Groups and Cosmic Networks</h3>
                <p>Galaxies don't interact chaotically; they often form "galactic alliances"—galaxy groups or clusters—around certain "central members." These alliances resemble human social networks: core galaxies act as "opinion leaders," while smaller galaxies "interact, learn, and transform" around them.</p>
                <p>For example, the Milky Way is currently engaged in a "slow cannibalization" process with several dwarf galaxies, most notably the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy. The resulting "stellar streams" are like "fracture marks" in galactic DNA, revealing which galaxies the Milky Way has absorbed over billions of years and what components it has inherited.</p>

                <h3>The Evolution of Galactic DNA: Shaping Identity from Ancestors to Modern Times</h3>
                <p>In the universe, no galaxy has a "pure lineage." Just as humans inherit genetic codes from diverse ancestors, our Milky Way has absorbed "genes" from multiple ancient galaxies. By observing stellar streams in the galactic halo, the chemical composition of globular clusters, and even the mass of the central black hole, scientists can reconstruct the Milky Way's evolutionary history.</p>
                <p>For instance, the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite has uncovered multiple stellar streams originating from absorbed galaxies. By analyzing the trajectories and metallicities of these stars, astronomers can "read" the "original genes" these galaxies once possessed and understand how the Milky Way gradually built its present form.</p>

                <h3>Aesthetics and Evolution: How Cosmic Art Tells the Story of Evolution</h3>
                <p>Galactic collisions are not just evolutionary processes—they are also visual spectacles: the Antennae Galaxies stretch out long tidal arms, while the Tadpole Galaxy leaves behind a luminous "tail." Scientists and artists reinterpret these structures and patterns, creating a unique interdisciplinary "cosmic art" that makes evolutionary history tangible.</p>
                <p>These images are not just scientific tools but also windows for the public to understand cosmic evolution. What we see is not just stars, gas, and gravity but also a beauty of evolution—a cosmic philosophy where destruction gives birth to new life and chaos builds order.</p>

            <section class="conclusion">
                <h3>Epilogue: The Future of Galactic "Genome" Research</h3>
                <p>The study of galactic DNA is at the forefront of astronomy. In the future, with larger telescopes and more spectroscopic and kinematic data, we will be able to "decode" more clues about galactic inheritance. Perhaps one day, we won't just identify the Milky Way's "distant relatives" but also "trace back" to those early cosmic "ancestors" that have completely merged and become nearly undetectable.</p>
                <p>In this sense, galaxies are not just fundamental structural units of the universe but living entities with evolutionary histories. Within their "genes" lie the secrets of the universe's journey from chaos to order, from youth to maturity.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The evolution of galaxies is no longer just about physical formulas and data assembly—it is a cosmic epic of "identity" and "inheritance."</p>
