            <h3>1. Emotional Design: Enhancing User Experience Through Emotional Connection</h3>
            <p><strong>Emotional Design</strong> enhances user experience by capturing and responding to the emotional state of users. This design approach focuses not only on aesthetics but also on understanding the psychological and behavioral aspects of users. In today's market, emotional design has become a crucial strategy for enhancing product competitiveness and user loyalty.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emotion Recognition Technology</strong>: Using AI and sensor technology to real-time identify the emotional state of users. For example, through facial expressions, voice tone, and heart rate monitoring, systems can determine the user's emotional state and provide personalized services.
                    <ul><li><em>Case</em>: Intelligent car systems can detect when a driver is feeling fatigued or stressed, automatically adjusting the seat, playing soothing music, or prompting for coffee.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Interface Design</strong>: Automatically adjusts the visual effects and interaction methods of the interface based on the user's emotional state. For example, when a user feels stressed, the interface can switch to softer tones and offer relaxation suggestions.
                    <ul><li><em>Case</em>: Health apps recommend deep breathing exercises or meditation music when the user is stressed.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Interactive Feedback Design</strong>: Incorporates humanized interactive feedback in product design, making users feel understood and empathized with. For example, smart home devices provide emotional feedback through sounds, lights, or vibrations.
                    <ul><li><em>Case</em>: Smart home systems enhance the feeling of belonging with light changes and warm welcome messages when users return home.</li></ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The significance of emotional design lies in increasing user satisfaction and loyalty, enhancing product competitiveness, and promoting psychological health. As technology advances, emotional design will become more intelligent and widespread, becoming one of the major trends in design.</p>

            <h3>2. Circular Design: Promoting Sustainable Development through Ecological Optimization</h3>
            <p><strong>Circular Design</strong> considers the environmental impact over the entire lifecycle of a product to promote sustainability. This is not just a technical and aesthetic challenge, but also a philosophical and ethical embodiment.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resource Efficiency and Material Selection</strong>: Choose renewable, recyclable, or biodegradable materials to reduce dependency on finite resources. For example, using recycled plastics, regenerated fibers, or fast-growing materials like bamboo.
                    <ul><li><em>Case</em>: A brand's sneakers use recycled plastic for the soles, reducing the demand for new plastic production.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Product Lifecycle Extension</strong>: Design products that are easy to repair, upgrade, or repurpose to extend their lifespan. For example, modular designs allow for independent replacement of parts.
                    <ul><li><em>Case</em>: Modular smartphones allow users to replace batteries, cameras, etc., extending the product's lifespan.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Circular Economy Model</strong>: Design products with the end of their lifecycle in mind, considering how they can be recycled, reused, or transformed into new products. For example, designing products that can be easily disassembled for material recovery.
                    <ul><li><em>Case</em>: IKEA introduced furniture series that can be completely recycled, ensuring that products do not become waste at the end of their lifecycle.</li></ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The significance of circular design lies in reducing environmental degradation, promoting sustainable use of resources, shifting economic activities from linear to circular, and enhancing economic resilience. In the future, circular design will become a core concept of design, driving society towards a more sustainable direction.</p>
