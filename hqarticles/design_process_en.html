            <h2>Design Process: From Logic to Narrative</h2>
            <p>Traditional design processes are often viewed as rational, function-oriented structures. However, in the evolving field of user experience design, the process itself is gradually being recognized as a "temporal narrative" â€” no longer just a path to complete tasks, but an unfolding process of emotional and meaningful exchange between users and products.</p>
            <p>This shift in perspective transforms design from a mere problem-solving tool into an experiential space that builds user memories and emotional connections.</p>

            <h3>From Linear Processes to Immersive Experiences</h3>
            <p>In early human-computer interaction design, the emphasis was on efficiency and clarity. Users moved from point A to B, completed tasks, and the simpler the process, the better. But in today's content-driven products, the process itself can become an experience, an unfolding narrative.</p>
            <p>For example, an e-commerce registration process is no longer just an information-gathering form, but a narrative moment that builds trust, generates anticipation, and even conveys brand values through gradual user interaction.</p>

            <h3>Design Process as "Storyboard"</h3>
            <p>Viewing the design process as a "storyboard" represents a new design thinking approach. Designers now consider: What is the user's emotional state at each stage? Are they feeling confused? Excited? In control?</p>
            <p>This perspective encourages designers to incorporate "contextual resonance," using interface language, interactive feedback, and visual rhythm to construct a journey with emotional highs and lows.</p>

            <h3>How Technology Supports Narrative Processes</h3>
            <p>With advances in front-end and interaction technologies, the "emotional curve" of processes can now be programmed and optimized. For instance, micro-interactions can enhance engagement during the process, while progressive loading can guide users to the next stage.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, AI-driven personalized processes can dynamically adjust user experience pathways, making each user's "story" unique.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Design is Not Just Process, But the Writing of Experience</h3>
            <p>The design process is transforming from a functional tool into a stage for emotional narratives. In the future of product experience design, the process itself will become part of the brand story, serving as a bridge for deep connections between users and products.</p>
            <p>Thus, designers are not just builders of functional flows, but narrators of experiential stories and orchestrators of emotional rhythms.</p>
