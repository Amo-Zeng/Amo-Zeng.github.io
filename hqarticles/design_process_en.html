            <h2>The Transformation of the Design Process: From Linear to Intelligent and Circular</h2>
            <p>In today's rapidly iterative design environment, the design process is undergoing unprecedented changes. Traditional design processes follow a linear model, from requirement analysis to final delivery, focusing on functional implementation and user experience optimization. However, with the rise of sustainable development concepts and the deep application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the design process is no longer limited to simple functional orientation or linear thinking. Today, the design process is evolving towards a more intelligent, circular, and user-centered direction, with the designer's role transitioning from a mere executor to a multidimensional collaborative innovator.</p>

            <h3>1. User Flow: The Psychological Foundation of the Design Process</h3>
            <p>User flow is an indispensable psychological foundation in the design process. It describes the psychological state and behavioral path of users when interacting with products, covering a complex process from cognition, decision-making to emotional reactions. Traditional design processes often neglect the psychological experience of users during product use, while modern design needs to integrate user flow into every design stage to enhance user emotional resonance and product stickiness.</p>
            <h4>1.1 From Functional Needs to Psychological Needs</h4>
            <p>During the requirement analysis phase, designers not only need to focus on users' functional needs but also deeply understand their emotional and cognitive needs. For example, can users quickly understand the core functions of the product when they first encounter it? Designers can meet users' cognitive needs by simplifying interface design and optimizing navigation paths. Additionally, users' emotional experience while using the product is equally important. Designers can enhance user emotional resonance and product attractiveness through visual design and brand tone.</p>
            <h4>1.2 Optimizing Key Nodes in User Flow</h4>
            <p>In the prototype design phase, designers need to incorporate key nodes in user flow into interaction design. For example, when users first use the product, designers can help them quickly understand the product's functions and operation logic through visual hierarchy and motion guidance. During the user decision-making phase, designers can assist users in making quicker and more expected decisions by reducing options and providing intelligent recommendations. In the emotional reaction phase, designers can enhance users' positive emotional experience through feedback mechanisms and emotional design.</p>

            <h3>2. Sustainable Design: From Linear to Circular Design Thinking</h3>
            <p>With global environmental issues becoming increasingly severe, the limitations of traditional linear design processes are becoming more apparent. Linear design processes rely on limited natural resources, and products are often directly discarded at the end of their life cycle, leading to significant waste of resources and environmental pollution. In this context, sustainable design thinking has emerged, driving the design process from a linear to a circular model.</p>
            <h4>2.1 Core Principles of Circular Design</h4>
            <p>Circular design draws on the natural circular system, aiming to achieve a closed product lifecycle through design. Its core principles include resource efficiency, design recyclability, extended product lifespan, recycling and remanufacturing, and user participation. For example, designers can ensure that products can be effectively disassembled and reused after their lifecycle by using modular design and easy-to-dismantle design. Additionally, designers need to consider the sustainability of materials, prioritizing renewable and recyclable materials to minimize environmental impact.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Practical Applications of Circular Design Process</h4>
            <p>Under the guidance of circular design, every stage of the design process undergoes profound changes. During the requirement analysis phase, designers not only analyze user needs but also assess whether these needs align with sustainable development principles. In the design phase, designers need to consider dimensions such as material renewability, production energy consumption, and product recyclability. During the product use phase, designers can extend the product's lifespan through software updates and module upgrades. In the scrapping and recycling phase, designers need to create products that are easy to recycle and reuse, ensuring they can be effectively recovered and recycled.</p>

            <h3>3. AI Collaboration: From Tool Empowerment to a Paradigm Shift</h3>
            <p>With the rapid development of AI technology, it has evolved from a mere design tool to a collaborative partner in the design process, and in some cases, it even leads design thinking. AI is no longer just a tool for executing design tasks; it now deeply participates in the decision-making process of design, becoming a "partner" of the designer.</p>
            <h4>3.1 AI's Data-Driven Design Thinking</h4>
            <p>The core advantage of AI lies in its powerful data processing capabilities. By analyzing vast amounts of design data, AI can reveal design patterns and trends that traditional designers may overlook. For example, AI can predict users' preferences for certain designs by analyzing user behavior data, helping designers identify target users' needs at the beginning of the design process. This data-driven design decision-making allows designers to innovate more objectively without relying on personal intuition or experience.</p>
