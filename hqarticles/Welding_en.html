            <p>Amid the wave of industrial intelligence, welding—a "craft" once heavily reliant on experience and intuition—is quietly undergoing a cognitive revolution. Artificial intelligence, through deep learning of subtle data from welder operations—the rhythm of current adjustment, the arc of torch movement, the timing of arc initiation—is gradually reproducing and even surpassing the indescribable "craftsmanship sensibility" of human welders. This technological leap not only enhances the stability of welding quality but also profoundly triggers deep reflection on <strong>the ownership of tacit knowledge, the redefinition of human skill value, and the ethics of technological responsibility</strong>.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>I. The Mechanism of AI Acquiring "Craftsmanship Sensibility": Datafication and Deconstruction of Tacit Knowledge</h3>
                <p>In traditional welding, a master welder's "craftsmanship sensibility" is a composite judgment integrating vision, hearing, and even touch. For instance, when welding stainless steel pipelines, welders adjust parameters in real-time based on molten pool color, arc sound, and spatter state—a type of knowledge difficult to textualize yet decisive for weld strength and sealing. Today, AI collects tens of thousands of operational data points via high-precision sensors and uses spatiotemporal sequence models (such as LSTM networks) to map the relationship between process parameters and welding quality, thereby forming a "virtual craftsmanship sensibility."</p>
                <p>Germany's CLOOS intelligent welding system can already autonomously generate parameter plans based on groove width, base material thickness, and ambient humidity, with dynamic adjustment precision surpassing even senior welders. However, this process本质上 (essentially) involves the "extraction" and "encoding" of human tacit knowledge: the experience accumulated by welders over years is dissected into data labels, and individualized "embodied knowledge" is transformed into portable algorithm models. This raises the first ethical question: <strong>When enterprises replace welders with AI systems, to whom do the rights of these digitally extracted "knowledge assets" belong?</strong> Is it necessary to establish a data compensation mechanism for welders' experience?</p>

                <h3>II. Devaluation of Experience and the Fog of Responsibility: Restructuring and Conflict in Human-Machine Relationships</h3>
                <p>As AI takes over core process decisions, the welder's role shifts from "operator" to "monitor." Research by the European Welding Federation shows that in factories adopting intelligent welding platforms, over 60% of welders are only responsible for equipment inspection and anomaly handling. This "deskilling" trend leads to a dual crisis:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Erosion of the Professional Value System</strong>: Welding craftsmanship is downgraded from a "craftsmanship skill" requiring long-term training to a low-cognitive-load ordinary job, impacting the professional identity of young practitioners;</li>
                    <li><strong>Formation of a Knowledge Transmission Gap</strong>: The non-digitized experience of older welders risks being lost, creating a "cognitive gap" between humans and machines.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>More critically, the "black box" decision-making of AI leads to accountability dilemmas. In 2022, a shipbuilding company faced large-scale quality disputes because an intelligent welder autonomously increased current, causing weld embrittlement, yet the AI's decision basis could not be traced—was it due to biased training data? Model overfitting? Or instantaneous sensor error? The current responsibility system struggles in the gap between "algorithmic responsibility" and "human responsibility."</p>

                <h3>III. The Boundary of AI's "Creativity": Philosophical Paradoxes in Process Innovation</h3>
                <p>When AI goes beyond imitation and uses reinforcement learning to generate process solutions beyond human experience, ethical issues intensify further. For example, at General Electric in the U.S., for aircraft engine blade welding, AI proposed a "pulse-continuous current alternating welding method," increasing fatigue life by 18%—a solution never seen in any manual or welder practice. Does this mean AI already possesses "creativity"? If so:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Should patents for AI-generated processes belong to the developer, the company, or the AI itself?</li>
                    <li>After providing training data, have welders become "silent knowledge contributors"?</li>
                    <li>When AI solutions conflict with human experience and intuition (e.g., increasing safety risks to improve efficiency), which should take precedence?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This touches on the core debate in the philosophy of technology: <strong>Must creativity be rooted in human consciousness and intentionality?</strong> When process innovation divorces from human contextual understanding, how should its value assessment criteria be reconstructed?</p>

                <h3>IV. Towards Intelligent with a Human Touch: Building an Industry Ethical Framework</h3>
                <p>Facing the above dilemmas, a response framework needs to be constructed from three dimensions: technical design, institutional norms, and industry ecology:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Knowledge Ethics Dimension</strong>: Establish mechanisms for rights confirmation and profit-sharing of welder experience data, e.g., recording data contribution trails via blockchain;</li>
                    <li><strong>Human-Machine Collaborative Design</strong>： Legally and technically retain human ultimate veto power and right to request explanations for AI decisions, adhering to the "Human-in-the-loop" principle;</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsibility Mechanism Innovation</strong>： Promote "AI Fault Liability Insurance" and algorithm auditing standards to balance technological innovation and risk distribution.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The intelligentization of welding is not merely a process evolution but also a <strong>renegotiation of power relations between human cognition and technological systems</strong>. Future intelligent welding should not be about "replacing craftsmen" but about融合 (integrating) human experiential wisdom with AI's superhuman computing power into a new form of "symbiotic intelligence." Only then can a balance be found between efficiency leaps and ethical guardianship, allowing the technological revolution to truly serve the enhancement of human value.</p>
