            <h3>I. Ecological Design and Wood Regeneration</h3>
            <p>The essence of <strong>ecological design</strong> is to reduce environmental impact through the design of products or systems while increasing resource efficiency. Wood, with its renewable, biodegradable, and natural characteristics, becomes the ideal material for ecological design:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Material Selection and Regeneration:</strong> Ecological design focuses on using renewable resources. Wood regeneration technologies not only decrease reliance on virgin forests but also reduce waste through innovative material uses like composite and recycled wood. This cycle of recycling and regeneration manages resources effectively and protects the environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Life Cycle Assessment (LCA):</strong> The entire life cycle of wood products, from raw material acquisition to final disposal, is assessed to ensure sustainability in environmental, economic, and social aspects.</li>
                <li><strong>Design Strategies:</strong> Modular design and disassembly-oriented design allow wood products to be easily maintained or recycled, extending their lifespan and reducing waste.</li>
            </ul>
