            <h2>Redefining the Future of Design Education: Design Thinking, Interdisciplinary Integration, and Localization Practice</h2>
            <p>In today's rapidly changing era, design education faces unprecedented challenges and opportunities. Traditional design education often gets trapped in the rut of "prioritizing tools over thinking." Students spend a significant amount of time learning the operation skills of design software but overlook the more important design thinking and philosophies. This phenomenon has led to deficiencies such as inadequate innovation capabilities, limited problem-solving abilities, and lack of empathy among design talents, making it difficult for them to adapt to the ever-evolving design requirements. To address these challenges, design education needs profound transformation, organically integrating design thinking, interdisciplinary integration, and localization practice, to cultivate truly innovative and globally-minded design talents.</p>

            <h3>Design Thinking: A User-Centered Innovation Methodology</h3>
            <p>Design thinking is not merely an abstract concept but a user-centered, systematic, and iterative design methodology. It emphasizes approaching problems from the user's perspective, solving them innovatively, and ultimately creating solutions that meet user needs and have social value. Integrating design thinking into the curriculum system is not just about adding a course; it involves infusing the essence of design thinking into every aspect of the curriculum and throughout the students' entire learning journey.</p>

            <h3>Interdisciplinary Integration: The Innovation Engine Breaking Disciplinary Barriers</h3>
            <p>In contemporary society, rapidly changing and increasingly complex, the knowledge system of a single discipline is no longer sufficient to address real-world challenges. The design field is no exception; interdisciplinary collaboration is emerging as a crucial force driving innovation and breakthroughs. Through the integration of architecture with psychology for therapeutic space design and product design with data analysis for user experience optimization, we can see the enormous potential of interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>

            <h3>Localization Practice: The Fusion of Cultural Heritage and Innovative Design</h3>
            <p>In the context of globalization, design education faces an important question: how to maintain innovative spirit while cultivating students' profound understanding and pride in local culture? The "localization" practice of design courses provides an effective path, enabling students to focus on regional cultural characteristics, thereby enhancing cultural confidence and innovative design capabilities while increasing the practical value and social impact of design works.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Pathway to the Future of Design Education</h3>
            <p>Combining design thinking, interdisciplinary integration, and localization practice represents a profound transformation in design education. It is not just a change in educational models but a change in mindset. Only by breaking the shackles of traditional design education, which "prioritizes tools over thinking," can we cultivate future design talents who are truly innovative, problem-solving, and empathetic. Through interdisciplinary integration, we can break down disciplinary barriers and nurture innovative design talents capable of addressing future challenges. Through localization practice, we can protect and传承local culture, cultivating design innovators with global vision and cultural confidence.</p>
