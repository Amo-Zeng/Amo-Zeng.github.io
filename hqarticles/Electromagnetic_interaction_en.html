            <h2>Introduction: The Transcendent Role of the Electromagnetic Field</h2>
            <p>Electromagnetic interaction is far more than the force between electric charges—it is a deep thread weaving through <strong>physics, life, and philosophy</strong>. In artificial systems, it encodes topological information; in living organisms, it transmits coordinating signals; in quantum reality, it is itself the generator of relational existence. The electromagnetic field (EMF) is no longer a passive "medium for force" in classical physics, but rather a <strong>unified entity: information carrier, structural medium, and relational reality</strong>. This article, using the conceptual framework of "EMF as X," reveals its multidimensional landscape from three dimensions: <strong>as the physical realization of information structure, as the informational language of life, and as an ontological node of relational existence</strong>. Together, these perspectives point toward a fundamental proposition: electromagnetic interaction is the <strong>primary foundation</strong> of cosmic informational order.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Part I: Topological Electromagnetics — EMF as the Physical Realization of Information Structure</h2>
            <p>In artificial electromagnetic systems, the EMF exhibits <strong>topologically protected robustness</strong>, making it an ideal platform for encoding quantum information. Topological Electromagnetics designs photonic crystals and metamaterials with non-trivial topological order (e.g., non-zero Chern number, Z₂ invariant, or higher-order corner states) to induce topologically protected boundary states. These boundary states are immune to defects, disorder, and geometric perturbations, realizing the physical mapping of "structure as information."</p>

            <p>The <strong>core insight</strong> is: <strong>the topological structure of the EMF directly determines the stability and controllability of information</strong>. For example, in two-dimensional photonic topological insulators, edge states propagate unidirectionally along boundaries, forming "topological waveguides" (Wang et al., <em>Nature</em>, 2009), which can be used to construct fault-tolerant quantum communication channels. A MIT team (<em>Science</em>, 2020) demonstrated topologically protected qubit readout in a superconducting-microwave cavity system, achieving fidelity above 99% even under strong noise, validating the protection of information integrity by topological order.</p>

            <p>Even more profoundly, <strong>higher-order topological insulators</strong> (HOTIs) localize multi-dimensional qubits via corner states (Benalcazar et al., <em>Science</em>, 2021), offering a new paradigm for high-dimensional quantum information processing. Here, the EMF is no longer a "background"—it is the <strong>physical embodiment of information structure</strong>: topological order is informational order, and boundary states are information channels.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>Analogy</strong>: Topological boundary states are like "information highways," whose robustness stems from global symmetry protection—just as in biological systems, where electric field propagation pathways depend on the topological integrity of tissues.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Part II: Biological Electromagnetic Fields — EMF as the Informational Language of Life</h2>
            <p>In biological systems, the EMF also serves an informational function, but its mechanism arises from <strong>evolutionarily selected natural topology</strong>. From the electric field spread of neuronal action potentials, to electric potential gradients in embryonic development, to macroscopic synchronization in heart and brain waves, Biological Electromagnetic Fields (BEFs) exhibit multidimensional encoding via <strong>frequency, phase, spatial gradient, and topological structure</strong>.</p>

            <p>The <strong>core insight</strong> is: <strong>the EMF is a "lingua franca" for non-chemical communication between cells</strong>, forming what we call the "electromics"—a network of electromagnetic signals within and between cells. A 2021 study in <em>PNAS</em> found that electric field gradients (~10–100 mV/mm) in zebrafish embryos directly regulate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, guiding cell migration and morphogenesis, indicating that electric fields are the <strong>physical script of developmental programs</strong>. <em>Science Advances</em> (2023) further confirmed that cardiomyocytes achieve synchronized contraction via ephaptic coupling (electric field coupling) without chemical synapses, at speeds three orders of magnitude faster than calcium diffusion.</p>

            <p>Even more strikingly, <strong>electric field propagation pathways in biological tissues possess topological properties</strong>: the connectome topology of neural networks determines modes of electric field synchronization (<em>Nat. Neurosci.</em>, 2022), while electric field disorder ("electro-disorder") in tumor microenvironments correlates positively with invasiveness (<em>Cell Syst.</em>, 2023). This suggests: <strong>the EMF in living systems is essentially a "natural topological waveguide"</strong>, whose informational function depends on the topological order of tissue structure.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>Cross-Domain Analogy</strong>: Topological boundary states in photonic crystals ↔ electric field synchronization in neural ensembles ↔ both determined by <strong>structural topology</strong>, revealing the deep consistency of "EMF as a unity of structure and information."
            </blockquote>

        <section>
            <h2>Part III: Relational Ontology — EMF as a Relational Node of Reality</h2>
            <p>When we ask, "What is the EMF itself?" the answer undergoes a radical shift in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). The EMF is no longer a classical entity, but an <strong>operator-valued field</strong> $\hat{A}_\mu(x)$, whose existence depends on quantum fluctuations, virtual photon exchange, and observation. In Carlo Rovelli’s Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM), <strong>physical quantities are defined only within system-observer relations</strong> (Rovelli, 1996).</p>

            <p>The <strong>core insight</strong> is: <strong>the EMF has no independent ontological status—it is an expression of relational existence</strong>. The Unruh effect (accelerated observers perceive thermal radiation) shows that the vacuum is not "empty," but a <strong>dynamic field configuration dependent on the reference frame</strong>. Vertices in Feynman diagrams are not "points of action," but <strong>nodes of relational intersection</strong>—each virtual photon exchange repositions the EMF within a relational network.</p>

            <p>We propose a <strong>Dynamic Relational Ontology</strong>: the EMF is a <strong>dynamic node within a network of interactional relations</strong>. It does not "exist in space," but is <strong>generated through measurement, coupling, and interaction</strong>. Karen Barad (2007) further argues in her "agential realism" that measurement is constitutive of phenomena. In this framework, the essence of electromagnetic interaction is <strong>the construction of relations</strong>, not the action of entities.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>Philosophical Elevation</strong>: The relational nature of field operators ↔ observer-dependence in cellular electric synchronization ↔ boundary-condition dependence of topological states—all reveal: <strong>the "reality" of the EMF emerges from its functional manifestation within a relational network</strong>.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Conclusion: Toward an "Electromagnetic Ontology" — The Triple Unity of Information, Structure, and Reality</h2>
            <p>These three perspectives are deeply <strong>isomorphic</strong>: together, they reveal the EMF as a unified entity of <strong>information-structure-reality</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>In Topological Electromagnetics</strong>, the EMF realizes <strong>information</strong> through <strong>artificial structure</strong> (topological order);</li>
                <li><strong>In Biological EMFs</strong>, it realizes <strong>information</strong> through <strong>living structure</strong> (tissue topology);</li>
                <li><strong>In Relational Ontology</strong>, it realizes <strong>reality</strong> through <strong>relational structure</strong> (observer-environment coupling).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We thus propose a new paradigm: "<strong>Electromagnetic Ontology</strong>":</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>The EMF is not merely a fundamental force, but the most basic relational information medium in the universe</strong>. It bridges quantum and classical, artificial and natural, physical and biological—it is the <strong>unified field of information generation, structure formation, and reality construction</strong>.
            </blockquote>

            <p>This paradigm will drive three interdisciplinary frontiers:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Quantum Technology</strong>: Build "topological-biological hybrid systems" enabling seamless EMF-based information interfaces between artificial and living systems;</li>
                <li><strong>Synthetic Life</strong>: Design "EMF-genetic" feedback loops to use electromics to regulate self-organization in synthetic cells;</li>
                <li><strong>Foundational Physics</strong>: Reconstruct spacetime from relational field theory, proposing "Electromagnetic-Relational Spacetime" to challenge substance-based ontology.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Electromagnetic interaction will ultimately become the <strong>first-principles foundation</strong> for understanding the informational essence of the universe. It teaches us: <strong>reality is not composed of "things," but woven from "relations"</strong>—and the EMF is the very warp and weft of this relational fabric.</p>

                The EMF is no longer just a "field," but the <strong>topological language of cosmic informational order, the bioelectric code of life, and the relational grammar of reality</strong>. We stand at the threshold of an ontological revolution—and the key is in the hands of electromagnetism.
