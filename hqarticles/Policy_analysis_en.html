            <h2>Policy Networks and Governance in the Digital Age: From Invisible Players to Long-termism Challenges and Breakthroughs</h2>
            <p>Against the backdrop of rapid digital technology advancement, the composition and operation of policy networks are undergoing profound transformations. Traditional policy participants such as governments, legislative bodies, interest groups, and the public remain the core forces in policy-making and implementation. However, with the rise of social media, data companies, and online platforms, these "invisible players" are increasingly becoming significant forces shaping policy agendas, influencing public preferences, and regulating policy dissemination. Meanwhile, the "last mile" dilemma of policy implementation and the long-term perspective of policy outcomes further reveal the complex challenges faced in policy formulation and implementation. This article will explore the new dynamics in policy networks during the digital age from these three perspectives and propose potential solutions.</p>

            <h3>I. Invisible Players: Digital Technology Reshaping Policy Networks</h3>
            <p>In traditional policy analysis frameworks, the setting and implementation of policy agendas often rely on the interactions of explicit participants. However, with the rise of social media, data companies, and online platforms, "invisible players" in policy networks have gradually gained significant importance. These invisible players, through technical means such as algorithmic recommendations, content moderation, and information dissemination, not only shape public issue attention but also profoundly impact policy agenda setting and dissemination effectiveness.</p>

                <li><strong>Data Companies:</strong> Algorithmic Recommendations and Policy Preferences</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>II. The "Last Mile" of Policy Implementation: Dilemmas and Breakthroughs</h3>
            <p>Although many policies are scientifically and reasonably designed and planned, they often face numerous challenges during implementation at the grassroots level. The "last mile" of policy implementation refers to the critical link from central and local government policy formulation to the actual benefit of grassroots citizens. In this link, resource constraints, information asymmetry, and goal conflicts are particularly prominent.</p>

                <li><strong>Information Asymmetry:</strong> Bottlenecks in Policy Transmission</li>
                <li><strong>Goal Conflicts:</strong> Intrinsic Contradictions in Policy Implementation</li>

        <section>
            <h3>III. The Long-termism Perspective: Reshaping Future Policy Evaluation</h3>
            <p>Traditional policy evaluation methods often focus on short-term effects, neglecting the profound long-term impacts of policies on the economy, society, and the environment. This shortsighted evaluation approach may result in policies appearing successful in the short term but leading to unforeseen negative consequences in the future. Therefore, adopting a "long-termism" perspective for policy evaluation is not only a profound reflection on policy science but also a key to ensuring sustainable development and long-term societal well-being.</p>

            <h3>IV. Conclusion: Governance Innovation from Invisible Players to Long-termism</h3>
            <p>In the digital age, invisible players in policy networks profoundly affect policy agendas, public preferences, and dissemination effectiveness through technical means. The "last mile" dilemma of policy implementation and the long-termism perspective further reveal the complex challenges in policy formulation and implementation. To address these challenges, policymakers need to focus on the following aspects:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Balancing Technology and Policy:</strong> Emphasizing the role of social media, data companies, and online platforms in policy networks, establishing transparent and fair content moderation mechanisms, and avoiding information polarization and the homogenization of policy preferences.</li>
                <li><strong>Overcoming Resource Constraints and Information Asymmetry:</strong> Through grassroots innovation and market mechanisms, addressing resource shortages, establishing smooth information transmission mechanisms, and ensuring that the needs of grassroots citizens are accurately reflected in policy formulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Transitioning from Short-termism to Long-termism:</strong> Introducing a long-termism perspective in policy evaluation, focusing on the profound impact of policies on future labor markets, intergenerational equity, and long-term development, ensuring policy sustainability.</li>
            </ol>
