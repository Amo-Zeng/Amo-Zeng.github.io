            <h2>AI in Education: Opportunities and Ethical Dilemmas</h2>
            <p>As AI enters the field of education, it has the potential to break down resource barriers but may also exacerbate existing inequalities. Intelligent education systems can now provide adaptive learning paths, but data privacy breaches place hundreds of millions of students at risk of profiling and discrimination. Admission evaluation systems driven by algorithms show an error rate that is 12.6% higher among minority groups, reshaping patterns of educational resource distribution.</p>

                <p>"Technology should not become a new carrier of privilege, but rather a catalyst for educational equity." - UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence in Education</p>

            <h3>Three Dimensions of the Technology Gap</h3>
            <p>Significant structural biases exist in global AI-based education systems:</p>
            <div class="data-visualization">
                <ul>
                    <li>Digital Divide: 83% of rural areas in developing countries lack basic AI education infrastructure</li>
                    <li>Algorithmic Discrimination: Students from low-income families have a 27% higher misclassification rate in AI admission models</li>
                    <li>Data Monopolies: The top five tech companies hold 61% of education data, hindering fair academic research</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Ethical Action Roadmap</h3>
            <p>Building an educational technology ethics framework requires:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Transparency Reform</strong> - Open source core educational algorithms and establish third-party auditing mechanisms</li>
                <li><strong>Inclusive Design</strong> - Guarantee that marginalized groups constitute at least 30% of datasets</li>
                <li><strong>Compensatory Mechanisms</strong> - Establish an AI in Education Fund to support disadvantaged groups in technology adoption</li>
            </ol>
