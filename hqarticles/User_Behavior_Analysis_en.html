In the Chinese education system, “Shu Jia” (数甲) typically refers to the **High School Mathematics Type A textbook** (简称“数学甲”), which is a colloquial term for the more advanced mathematics textbooks or courses designed for science track students in high school. Below is a detailed overview of “Shu Jia”:

---

### **1. Background and Definition**
- **Scope of Application**: Commonly found in science classes or key high schools in certain provinces of China (such as Shanghai, Zhejiang, etc.) as an extended curriculum for the science track math section of the Gaokao (National College Entrance Examination).
- **Difficulty Level**: More advanced than regular high school math (“Shu Yi” 数乙 or liberal arts math), covering pre-university topics such as calculus, linear algebra, probability, and statistics.
- **Historical Development**: In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a textbook titled *“Senior High School Algebra (Type A)”*. Currently, most “Shu Jia” courses are locally or school-developed versions.

### **2. Main Content**
A typical Shu Jia curriculum may include:
- **Introduction to Calculus**: Limits, derivatives, integrals (e.g., polynomial functions).
- **Linear Algebra**: Matrix operations, determinants, vector spaces.
- **Probability and Statistics**: Conditional probability, distributions, hypothesis testing.
- **Extended Geometry**: Spatial analytic geometry, parametric equations.

### **3. Connection to the Gaokao**
- **Science Math Paper**: Some content may appear in the final challenging questions of the Gaokao science math paper (e.g., comprehensive derivative applications).
- **University Admission and Competitions**: Mastery of Shu Jia knowledge benefits university independent admissions (e.g., the "Strong Foundation Plan") and math competitions (such as the first round of the national mathematics league).

### **4. Comparison with Other Math Courses**
| Type               | Depth of Content                | Target Students           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Shu Jia (Science)  | High; includes pre-university content | Science students aiming for top universities (e.g., Project 985) |
| Shu Yi (Liberal Arts)| Basic; emphasizes practical application | Liberal arts students     |
| Math Competition   | Competition techniques, advanced theory  | Math talents             |

### **5. Learning Suggestions**
- **Solidify Fundamentals**: Ensure mastery of the compulsory textbooks of People’s Education Press (Volumes 1-5 and elective 2-1).
- **Practice Real Exam Questions**: Study challenging questions from Gaokao science math papers (e.g., Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces).
- **Reference Materials**:
  - *High School Mathematics Type A* (older textbook, useful for conceptual understanding)
  - *Have You Really Mastered Gaokao Math? (Functions/Sequences Volume)*
