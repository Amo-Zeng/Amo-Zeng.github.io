            <h2>Applications of Fermat's Little Theorem in Modern Cryptography</h2>
            <p>Fermat's Little Theorem's application in the RSA encryption algorithm demonstrates the close integration of mathematical theory and practical applications, especially in ensuring information security. The security of the RSA algorithm relies on the difficulty of factoring large integers, and Fermat's Little Theorem provides the mathematical foundation for this challenge by ensuring certain properties of modular arithmetic. However, with the development of quantum computing, Fermat's Little Theorem faces new challenges. Exploring how to reevaluate and apply Fermat's Little Theorem in quantum-secure algorithms will be an important direction for the future development of cryptography.</p>
