            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Traditional contrastive learning methods often limit their comparisons to a single dimension, overlooking the complex structures within objects and the multiple influences of the external environment. This superficial comparison fails to reveal the essential differences of objects, especially in the analysis of complex systems, often leading to conclusions that are one-sided and limited. To better understand the intrinsic differences and similarities of contrastive objects, we can adopt a multidimensional fusion approach. By integrating dimensional decomposition, external environment perspectives, and interdisciplinary perspectives, we can achieve a deeper extension of contrastive learning. This method not only provides a more comprehensive analytical perspective but also reveals the uniqueness and commonalities of objects across different dimensions, thereby offering more reliable grounds for decision-making and optimization.</p>

            <h3>Theoretical Basis and Application of Dimensional Decomposition Method</h3>
            <p>The core idea of the dimensional decomposition method is to break down complex objects into several relatively independent dimensions, then analyze each dimension in depth. These dimensions usually represent the key features or attributes of the object, with each dimension representing the performance or characteristics of the object in a certain aspect. By comparing these dimensions one by one, we can better understand the differences and similarities between objects, avoiding misunderstandings caused by one-sided analysis of a single dimension.</p>
            <p>In the process of dimensional decomposition, we need to follow the following basic principles:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Comprehensiveness</strong>: The chosen dimensions should comprehensively cover the core features of the object, avoiding the omission of important analysis points.</li>
                <li><strong>Independence</strong>: Each dimension should be as independent as possible, avoiding overlapping between dimensions, to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Relevance</strong>: Although dimensions should be independent, they are not entirely isolated, and potential correlations between dimensions should be considered during the analysis.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Contrastive Learning from the External Environment Perspective</h3>
            <p>In contrastive learning, we often focus on the object's own features and internal structure, neglecting the profound impact of the external environment. This inward-looking contrastive method, while revealing some intrinsic differences, may overlook many critical external factors that often play a crucial role in the object's adaptability and competitiveness. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of contrastive objects, it is necessary to attempt a contrastive analysis from the external environment perspective. This method not only reveals the performance of objects in different environments but also helps us predict their adaptability and competitiveness in future environmental changes.</p>
            <p>The core idea of the external environment perspective is to closely link the features and performance of the object with its environment. By analyzing the key elements of the external environment, we can understand the object's adaptability and competitiveness in these environments. These external environment elements typically include but are not limited to the international trade environment, resource endowments, political systems, market competition, technological innovation, etc. Through in-depth analysis of these external environmental factors, we can better understand the performance and trends of objects in these environments, thereby providing more comprehensive grounds for decision-making and optimization.</p>

            <h3>Deep Contrastive Learning from an Interdisciplinary Perspective</h3>
            <p>In traditional contrastive learning, we often limit ourselves to the perspective of a single discipline, overlooking the unique methods and profound insights of other disciplines. This single-disciplinary contrastive method, while providing valuable information in some cases, may limit our comprehensive understanding and in-depth analysis of complex issues. To overcome this limitation, it is necessary to adopt an interdisciplinary approach to contrastive learning, integrating theories and practices from different disciplines to view contrastive objects from a new perspective, discovering their intrinsic correlations and regularities. This method not only reveals the essential differences of objects but also provides richer ideas for innovation and optimization.</p>
            <p>The core idea of interdisciplinary contrast is to integrate methods and perspectives from different disciplines into contrastive learning through multi-dimensional analysis, revealing the intrinsic correlations and regularities of objects. The advantage of this method lies in the unique research methods and theoretical frameworks of different disciplines, which can reveal the essence of problems from different angles. For example, psychology can help us understand consumer behavior and decision-making processes, sociology can reveal the influence of social culture on market strategies, and brain science and cognitive science can provide scientific grounds for educational models. Through interdisciplinary contrastive analysis, we can gain a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding, thereby providing more scientific grounds for decision-making and optimization.</p>

            <h3>Practical Application: Business Model Comparison under Multidimensional Fusion Perspective</h3>
            <p>To better illustrate the application of the multidimensional fusion perspective, we can take the comparison analysis of business models as an example. Traditional business model comparisons often simply compare the profitability and market share of two models, overlooking the intrinsic complexity and diversity of business models. Through a multidimensional fusion method, we can conduct in-depth analysis from the following multiple angles:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Value Proposition</strong>: The core of a business model is the value it provides to customers. Different business models may have significant differences in value propositions, such as low-price strategies, personalized services, premium experiences, etc. By comparing the value propositions of two business models, we can understand their target customer groups and market positioning.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Structure</strong>: Cost structure is a key factor for the sustainability of a business model. Different business models may have significant differences in cost structure, such as the ratio of fixed costs to variable costs, the ratio of production costs to operating costs, etc. By comparing the cost structures of two business models, we can understand their operational efficiency and financial risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Revenue Model</strong>: The revenue model is the core goal of a business model. Different business models may have significant differences in revenue models, such as direct sales, subscription services, advertising revenue, etc. By comparing the revenue models of two business models, we can understand their revenue sources and profitability.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer Relations</strong>: Customer relations are a crucial factor for business model success. Different business models may have significant differences in customer relations, such as direct sales, agents, partners, etc. By comparing the customer relations of two business models, we can understand their market expansion capabilities and customer loyalty.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Allocation</strong>: Resource allocation is a key factor for business model implementation. Different business models may have significant differences in resource allocation, such as human resources, technical resources, financial resources, etc. By comparing the resource allocation of two business models, we can understand their execution capabilities and market competitiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>International Trade Environment</strong>: The international trade environment is an important external factor for a business model. Different business models may show significant differences in coping with changes in the international trade environment, such as open economy models and closed economy models. By comparing the performance of two business models in the international trade environment, we can understand their openness and resilience to external shocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Innovation</strong>: Technological innovation is an external driving force for a business model. Different business models may show significant differences in technological innovation, such as technology-driven economies and labor-intensive economies. By comparing the technological innovation performance of two business models, we can understand their technological levels and future development potential.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumer Psychology</strong>: Consumer psychology is an external influence on a business model. Different business models may show significant differences in consumer psychology, such as brand loyalty and acceptance of new products. By comparing the performance of two business models in consumer psychology, we can understand their market acceptance and user loyalty.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Through this multidimensional fusion method, we can comprehensively and deeply compare the strengths and weaknesses of two business models, thereby providing more scientific grounds for strategic decision-making of enterprises.</p>
