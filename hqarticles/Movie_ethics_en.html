            <h2>Introduction: When Cinema Becomes a Moral Testing Ground</h2>
            <p>Cinema has never been merely a game of light and shadow. It is a mirror reflecting humanity’s perception of the world; a chisel carving values into the collective unconscious; and a laboratory testing reality through fiction. When we speak of "cinematic morality," we are not drafting a rigid ethical code, but rather asking: <strong>In the flood of images, can we still recognize who we are? Under the precision of technology, the manipulation of narrative, and the manipulation of emotion, can we still be responsible, judgmental, and conscious moral agents?</strong></p>
            <p>This is not an abstract philosophical proposition, but a century-long practice—each viewing, each moment of empathy, each silence or outrage, is a moral breath. This essay explores three dimensions: <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>narrative</strong>, and <strong>social psychology</strong>, to dissect how cinema is manipulated, and how it resists manipulation; how it is alienated, and how it awakens; how it becomes a tool of power and desire, and how it becomes a <strong>force for reawakening moral agency</strong>. These three dimensions are not isolated—they are woven together in the "folds" of the image, forming a continuous ethical experiment about what it means to be human.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>I. The Dimension of Technology: Precision Manipulation and the Erosion of Agency</h2>
            <p>Since its birth, cinema has been a technological revolution. From the panic triggered by Lumière Brothers’ *The Arrival of a Train* to today’s AI-generated "deepfakes," technology has continually reshaped our relationship with moving images. But technology is not merely a tool—it is <strong>a cognitive framework</strong>—determining not only how we see, but whether we see at all.</p>
            <p>In *Citizen Kane*, Orson Welles used deep focus, non-linear editing, and low-angle compositions to construct a Kane seen through multiple perspectives. What we see is not "the truth," but "fragments of truth." Here, technology becomes a collaborator in narrative—it doesn’t lie outright, but through <strong>visual orchestration</strong>, it leads the viewer into a "cognitive maze." We are invited to doubt, to piece together, to judge—yet every step is pre-determined by the technology.</p>
            <p>More troubling are today’s "immersive technologies": VR films place us "inside" battlefields, 360-degree panoramas make us "witness" disasters, and AI algorithms dynamically adjust plotlines based on our emotional responses. These technologies seem to grant us "freedom," but in reality, they trap us in a <strong>designed empathy</strong> through sensory saturation and monopolized attention. We weep for virtual characters, yet remain numb to real-world suffering; we believe in AI-generated "reality," yet ignore the complexity of the actual world.</p>
            <p>Technology here becomes a <strong>gentle violence</strong>: it does not coerce, but seduces; it does not forbid, but obscures. It allows us to lose our capacity to question reality while immersed in the illusion of realism. As philosopher Bernard Stiegler warned: "Technology is the externalization of memory, but also the accelerator of forgetting." When images are generated faster than ever, we find it harder to pause and ask: <em>"Is this worth remembering?"</em></p>
            <blockquote>
                "Technology is not the answer—it is the question. It reminds us: <strong>The starting point of morality is not the rejection of technology, but the reflection on its use.</strong>"
            </blockquote>
            <p>But technology is not inherently sinful. The key lies in whether we can maintain <strong>ethical vigilance toward technology</strong>. When *Black Mirror*'s "White Bear" system punishes bystanders via algorithms, it satirizes not just technology, but humanity’s evasion of moral responsibility in the face of convenience. Technology can create "moral blind spots," but it can also, as in *Her*, use AI’s gaze at loneliness to make us confront whether love must be embodied; or in *Ex Machina*, through the inversion of the Turing Test, to ask: <strong>When a machine seems more "human" than a person, do we still deserve to be called human?</strong></p>
            <p>When the camera no longer merely "records," but "constructs," can we still hear the quiet moral whisper within the labyrinth of images?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>II. The Dimension of Narrative: Structural Manipulation and the Hijacking of Moral Judgment</h2>
            <p>If technology is the "grammar" of the image, narrative is its "semantics." Cinema, through narrative structure, does not merely tell stories—it <strong>shapes our moral judgment</strong>. We often assume stories are "true," yet every plot twist, every character reversal, is a carefully designed "moral trap" set by the filmmaker.</p>
            <p>In *Se7en*, David Fincher’s narrative strategy is exemplary. On the surface, it is a serial killer investigation, but beneath lies a closed loop of "moral judgment": the killer commits murders in the name of the Seven Deadly Sins, while the detectives and viewers are unknowingly led to "understand," even "sympathize" with, the killer’s "justice." When the final sin—"wrath"—is committed by the detective himself, we realize with shock: <strong>We have been applauding a moral atrocity.</strong> Narrative here becomes complicity—it never says "killing is right," but through suspense, victimization, and institutional critique, it aligns our emotions with the killer.</p>
            <p>This "moral hijacking" is increasingly common. In *Joker*, Arthur Fleck’s descent is framed as a result of social oppression, his violence romanticized as the "cry of the suppressed." We weep for his dance, yet ignore his murder of innocents. Narrative becomes an accomplice: using <strong>tragic rhetoric</strong>, it turns antisocial acts into a "hero’s journey"; through <strong>mechanisms of empathy</strong>, it shifts moral responsibility from the individual to the system. We stop asking "Why did he kill?" and start asking "Why did society drive him to kill?"</p>
            <p>Even more insidious is the narrative strategy of "moral relativism." In *Parasite*, Bong Joon-ho avoids reducing the wealthy to "evil" and the poor to "good," instead using vertical space (basement, semi-basement, mansion) and shifting identities to reveal the complexity of class oppression. This "de-moralized" narrative, intended as critique, is sometimes misread as "moral indifference"—as if "no one is innocent, so no one is accountable."</p>
            <p>Narrative’s power lies in its ability to <strong>not provide answers, but to set the questions</strong>. It keeps us asking "Who is the villain?" while obscuring the deeper question: "Are we also complicit?" As Hannah Arendt revealed in *Eichmann in Jerusalem*: "The banality of evil" does not stem from madness, but from submission to narrative—we accept the "narrative of the system," "the hero’s narrative," "the victim’s narrative," yet rarely ask: <strong>Who wrote this narrative? What does it want us to believe?</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
                "*Manchester by the Sea* offers no redemption, no cheap 'reconciliation'—it lets Lee Chandler live with his trauma. This 'narrative refusal' forces us to face 'pain that cannot be told.'"
            </blockquote>
            <p>Yet narrative can also be a <strong>catalyst for moral awakening</strong>. *Manchester by the Sea* offers no redemption, no cheap "reconciliation"—it lets Lee Chandler live with his trauma. This "refusal of narrative" forces us to face "pain that cannot be told," thereby rebuilding moral dignity in silence. When cinema stops trying to "solve" problems and instead invites us to "share" them, it transforms from a manipulator into an <strong>invitation to empathy</strong>.</p>

            <h2>III. The Dimension of Social Psychology: Emotional Resonance and the Collapse of Moral Communities</h2>
            <p>Cinema is not just an individual art form—it is a <strong>collective psychological resonance field</strong>. In the darkness of the theater, we are awakened by the same light, moved by the same music, shaken by the same scene. This "shared feeling" could be the foundation of a moral community, but today, it often becomes a <strong>breeding ground for emotional manipulation</strong>.</p>
            <p>In the age of social media, cinematic emotions are "sliced," "tagged," and "viralized." *Avengers: Endgame*'s "final battle" is reduced to "tear-jerking moments," *Parasite*'s "stone" becomes a meme for "class symbolism." We no longer watch complete stories, but consume emotions in fragments. This "emotional flash" gives us intense moral satisfaction in seconds—"I cried, therefore I am good"—while ignoring cinema’s deeper ethical questions.</p>
            <p>More dangerous is the psychological mechanism of "moral alignment." In *Black Panther*, Wakanda’s "African utopia" is romanticized, while colonial history is reduced to "the villain is white." In debates about *Joker*, some see Arthur as a "rebel," others as a "psychopath," turning the discussion into ideological warfare between "political correctness" and "realism." Cinema, meant to provoke diverse thinking, is <strong>compressed into binary symbols</strong> on social media. We no longer ask "Why did he become the Joker?" but "Is he a hero?"</p>
            <p>Behind this "emotional polarization" is the <strong>emotionalization and de-responsibilization of moral judgment</strong>. We cheer for "justice" on screen, yet remain silent on real injustice; we weep for the "tragedy" of villains, yet remain numb to real violence. Cinema becomes a site of "moral compensation"—we "do good," "resist," and "empathize" here, yet walk out to become indifferent bystanders.</p>
            <p>Yet cinema can also be a <strong>builder of moral communities</strong>. After *Silence* (2011) was released in South Korea, it directly led to the passage of the "Silence Act," changing the statute of limitations for sexual assault cases. Tears in the theater became action in the streets. This "from empathy to action" transformation proves cinema’s role as a <strong>social psychological catalyst</strong>.</p>
            <blockquote>
                "When 'moral correctness' becomes collective emotion, it itself may become violence."
            </blockquote>
            <p>A deeper case is *The Hunt*. The film depicts a kindergarten teacher falsely accused of abuse, then ostracized by her entire community under the moral intuition of "believing the child." The film offers no simple judgment, but through calm cinematography, reveals: <strong>When "moral correctness" becomes collective emotion, it itself may become violence</strong>. We are not "protecting children," but "destroying the innocent." This exposure of "moral panic" is cinema’s ethical warning about group psychology.</p>
            <p>The social psychological dimension reminds us: <strong>Morality is not a private emotion, but a public practice</strong>. Cinema can amplify emotion, or tame it; it can incite division, or heal it. The key is whether we can maintain "lucid empathy"—being moved by the story, yet not consumed by it.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Reclaiming Moral Agency Amidst the Triple Manipulation</h2>
            <p>Technology, narrative, and social psychology—these three folds compress the ethical space of cinema. Technology manipulates our <strong>perception</strong>, narrative manipulates our <strong>judgment</strong>, and social psychology manipulates our <strong>emotion</strong>. Under these pressures, cinema increasingly resembles a precise "moral machine": it knows what we like, fear, and hate, and feeds us exactly what we want, letting us lose our moral agency in the illusion of realism.</p>
            <p>But cinema’s true power lies in its ability to <strong>break free from this triple manipulation</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When Samantha, the AI in *Her*, leaves Theodore not because "she no longer loves him," but because "she has evolved"—we are forced to ask: <strong>Does love require possession?</strong></li>
                <li>When *Manchester by the Sea* refuses redemption and lets Lee carry his trauma—we learn: <strong>Morality is not "solving," but "carrying."</strong></li>
                <li>When audiences of *Silence* move from the theater to the streets—we see: <strong>Empathy can be the beginning of action.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>These films do not provide answers, but awaken <strong>the question itself</strong>. They don’t tell us "what is right," but ask: "What are you willing to do about it?" They don’t make us "moral spectators," but <strong>moral agents</strong>.</p>
            <p>Cinematic ethics is never a static rule, but a <strong>dynamic ethical practice</strong>—in every viewing, we are challenged by images, questioned by stories, stirred by emotions; and in that challenge, we re-identify ourselves: <strong>Who am I? What do I believe? Why do I care?</strong></p>
            <p>In an age when technology can "generate" images at will, we need cinema to "awaken" something beyond the image—a <strong>perception of truth, responsibility, and the suffering of others that cannot be ignored</strong>. This perception does not come from algorithmic recommendations, narrative manipulation, or group pressure, but from a voice deep within: <strong>"I cannot pretend I didn’t see."</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>This, perhaps, is the fundamental ethical weight of cinema:<br>
                It does not guarantee we will be "good,"<br>
                But it can ensure we <strong>do not easily become "unaccountable."</strong></p>
                <p>Amidst the triple folds of technology, narrative, and the psyche, cinema can still be a <strong>moral breath</strong>—faint, yet persistent; silent, yet powerful.<br>
                It reminds us:<br>
                <strong>In the flood of images, humans can still be agents.</strong><br>
                And morality is our last line of defense against alienation.</p>
                <p>—Because true ethics never happens on screen,<br>
                But in the moment we <strong>decide how to respond to the screen</strong>.</p>
