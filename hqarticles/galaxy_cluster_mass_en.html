            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The mass of galaxy clusters consists of visible matter (like stars, interstellar gas) and dark matter. Traditional measurement methods rely mainly on single-wavelength observations, which have significant limitations. Combining multi-wavelength observations with gravitational lensing effects, and comparing with simulation data, not only overcomes these limitations but also provides more accurate mass measurements. The importance of galaxy cluster mass measurement goes beyond its direct impact on cosmic structures; it also helps us to verify and improve cosmological models.</p>

            <h3>I. Comprehensive Analysis of Multi-Wavelength Observations</h3>
            <p>By integrating data from X-ray, optical, radio, etc., we can perform cross-validation, multi-scale analysis, and compare simulations with observations to validate and enhance results.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>X-ray Observations:</strong> These primarily detect hot gas in clusters, estimating gas mass through brightness and temperature spectra, thereby inferring total mass. For example, in the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster, X-ray observations show differences in gas temperature compared to simulation results.</li>
                <li><strong>Optical Observations:</strong> Mass is estimated by measuring the velocity dispersion of member galaxies, but this is limited by the range of observations and interference from foreground and background galaxies.</li>
                <li><strong>Radio Observations:</strong> Using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) to measure gas pressure distribution independently of distance.</li>
                <li><strong>Gravitational Lensing Effects:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Strong Gravitational Lensing:</em> Provides high-precision mass constraints in the central regions of clusters.</li>
                        <li><em>Weak Gravitational Lensing:</em> Offers global mass distribution information through the distortion of background galaxies' shapes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Application of Gravitational Lensing</h3>
            <p>Combining weak and strong gravitational lensing offers the following advantages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Accuracy and Coverage: Strong lensing accurately measures mass in central regions, while weak lensing provides a global perspective.</li>
                <li>Complementarity in Mass Estimation: The two methods complement each other, reducing systematic errors and increasing result reliability.</li>
                <li>Model Validation and Improvement: Data from both lensing effects can cross-verify the accuracy of galaxy cluster mass models.</li>
                <li>Constraints on Cosmological Parameters: Provides precise constraints on fundamental cosmological parameters, aiding in understanding cosmic evolution.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h3>III. Comparison Analysis Between Simulations and Observations</h3>
            <p>By comparing N-body simulations, fluid dynamics simulations with observational methods, simulation parameters can be calibrated, and observational methods improved.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simulation Methods:</strong> Reproduce the evolution of cosmic structures, calculate mass distribution and mass function.</li>
                <li><strong>Observational Methods:</strong> Include X-ray observations, weak gravitational lensing, and dynamic analysis.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>IV. Challenges and Future Outlook</h3>
            <p>Although multi-wavelength observations, gravitational lensing, and simulation analysis provide rich information, challenges such as data calibration, model dependency, and observational limitations still exist.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>V. Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Through the integration of multi-wavelength observations, gravitational lensing, and comparison analysis between simulations and observations, our understanding of galaxy cluster masses has greatly advanced. This comprehensive approach not only enhances measurement precision but also reveals more details about the formation and evolution of cosmic structures. Future research will continue to innovate in theory and observational technology, further unveiling the deep mysteries of the universe.</p>
