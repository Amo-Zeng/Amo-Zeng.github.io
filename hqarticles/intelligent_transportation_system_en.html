            <h2>Future Development of Intelligent Transportation Systems</h2>
            <p>With the further advancement of smart city construction, intelligent transportation systems are facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges. While the traditional "technology-driven" model has significantly improved traffic efficiency and reduced accidents, its limitations are becoming increasingly apparent. Future intelligent transportation systems must break away from the "technology-driven" mindset, return to the core concept of "people-oriented," and create a safe, convenient, comfortable, and green travel environment. This will lead to a transformation from "vehicle-road collaboration" to "vehicle-city symbiosis" and from "autonomous driving" to "mobility as a service."</p>

            <h3>1. From "Vehicle-Road Collaboration" to "Vehicle-City Symbiosis": Ecological Integration of Smart Transportation</h3>
            <p>The traditional "vehicle-road collaboration" model focuses on the information exchange between vehicles and roads, but its limitation is the difficulty in meeting the needs of sustainable urban development in the future. The future intelligent transportation system needs to build an "vehicle-city symbiosis" ecosystem, achieving deep integration of transportation with other urban systems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Breaking information silos, building a comprehensive data sharing platform</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Creating a digital twin city with a combination of virtual and real</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Promoting green and shared mobility</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. From "Autonomous Driving" to "Mobility as a Service": Redefining Future Travel</h3>
            <p>The development of autonomous driving technology has brought new possibilities to intelligent transportation systems, but the future direction should not be limited to "autonomous" and "driving." Instead, it should deeply integrate autonomous driving technology with the concept of the sharing economy, building a comprehensive "Mobility as a Service" (MaaS) platform.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creating an all-in-one travel service platform</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Providing personalized travel solutions</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Exploring new business models</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. From "Technology-Driven" to "Humanistic": Returning to User Needs, Enhancing User Experience</h3>
            <p>The ultimate goal of intelligent transportation systems is to serve people and enhance their travel experience. Therefore, the future development needs to shift from "technology-driven" to "humanistic," focusing on user needs and improving user experience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Focusing on vulnerable groups, providing equal travel services</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Optimizing interaction methods, enhancing user experience</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening traffic safety education</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>From "technology-driven" to "humanistic," from "vehicle-road collaboration" to "vehicle-city symbiosis," from "autonomous driving" to "mobility as a service," the future development of intelligent transportation systems requires us to change our mindset, return to the core concept of "people-oriented," focus on user needs, enhance user experience, and build a safe, convenient, comfortable, and green travel environment. Only in this way can intelligent transportation systems truly serve people, allowing technological progress to benefit every participant in transportation and contribute to building a better urban transportation system.</p>
