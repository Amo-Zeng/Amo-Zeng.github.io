This separated process was not only time-consuming but also prone to data loss or damage. However, with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, intelligent equipment is achieving true seamless connection, automatically synchronizing data, and greatly simplifying the post-production process.</p>
            <p>For example, some high-end cameras can directly connect to computers, tablets, and other devices via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, transmitting shooting data in real-time. Creators can immediately view materials during shooting, or even remotely control camera parameters such as focus and exposure. This real-time synchronization feature not only improves work efficiency but also allows creators to enter the post-production stage immediately after shooting, avoiding the complexity of material management.</p>
            <p>Moreover, intelligent post-production software can automatically identify key frames in materials through AI technology, generate rough cuts, and even recommend the best editing solutions based on the creator's shooting intentions. This automated processing not only reduces the time cost of post-production work but also provides creators with more creative freedom. For example, during video editing, the system can automatically adjust the colors and lighting effects of the picture, making the final work more in line with the creator's artistic vision.</p>
