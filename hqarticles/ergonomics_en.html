            <h2>Health Crisis in the Digital Age: From "Digital Detox" to "Digital Health"</h2>
            <p>As the digital wave sweeps across the globe, electronic devices have become the core of our lives and work. However, the accompanying health issues—such as cervical spine problems, vision deterioration, and mental stress—have become a shared challenge for hundreds of millions worldwide. In this context, ergonomics, as a discipline studying the interaction between humans and their environment, has evolved from a mere health protection tool to a significant force driving social change.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Negative Impacts of Digital Devices on the Body</h3>
            <p>The widespread use of smartphones, computers, and tablets has led to various health issues. Problems like cervical spine problems, vision deterioration, wrist pain, and more not only impact work efficiency but also disrupt daily life. Moreover, information overload and excessive use of social networks pose significant challenges to mental health.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Ergonomic Solutions</h3>
            <p>To address these issues, ergonomics offers a range of scientific designs and behavioral adjustments. For instance, adjusting the height and distance of monitors, choosing ergonomic keyboards and mice, can effectively reduce fatigue in the neck, wrist, and fingers. Additionally, the "20-20-20" rule helps alleviate eye strain, while regular breaks and moderate physical exercise can mitigate the physical burdens of prolonged sitting. Importantly, psychological regulation is equally crucial.</p>

            <h3>Smart Technology and Future Trends</h3>
            <p>Future digital health will become more intelligent. Wearable devices will be instrumental in monitoring bodily data, smart office furniture will automatically adjust to fit different users' physical characteristics, and virtual reality technology will, through scientific wear designs, help users maintain a healthy balance between the virtual and real worlds. These technologies will transform "digital health" from a concept into reality, offering more health safeguards for our digital lives.</p>

            <h2>From Offices to Third Spaces: Ergonomics Reshaping the Workplace</h2>
            <p>With the rise of remote work, flexible work, and shared workspaces, the traditional fixed office model is gradually being disrupted. Working from home has become the norm, and cafes and co-working spaces have become new choices for many. This diversification of work scenarios requires us to rethink how to design more flexible, comfortable, and efficient work environments.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Ergonomics in Third Spaces</h3>
            <p>Ergonomics optimizes these new work scenarios through scientific design. For example, at home, choosing an office chair that matches the body's curves and appropriate lighting can effectively relieve lower back pain and eye fatigue. In cafes and shared workspaces, portable seats and laptop stands help users adjust their sightlines, reducing neck strain, while noise-canceling headphones and soundproof pods provide a focused work environment.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Smart and Personalized Future Workplaces</h3>
            <p>In the future, smart office furniture will automatically adjust based on users' height and habits, and smart lighting and temperature control systems will optimize according to environmental changes. Meanwhile, the application of virtual reality technology will make remote collaboration more immersive, offering new possibilities for future work models.</p>

            <h2>From "Elderly" to "All-Age": Ergonomics Driving Inclusive Society</h2>
            <p>As global aging intensifies, the quality of life and safety of the elderly are receiving increasing attention. Issues such as mobility difficulties, vision deterioration, and joint pain not only affect the daily lives of the elderly but also pose higher demands on public facilities and product design. However, traditional "elderly-specific" designs often overlook the universality and inclusivity of the design.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>From "Targeted Design" to "All-Age Design"</h3>
            <p>The core goal of ergonomics is to optimize the relationship between humans and products or environments to make them more comfortable, safe, and efficient. This goal applies not only to the elderly but also to people of all ages and physical conditions. For example, barrier-free designs not only benefit the elderly using wheelchairs but also provide convenience for other groups; the application of smart temperature control systems and eco-friendly materials meets the demand for sustainable development.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Smart Aging and the Future of Inclusive Society</h3>
            <p>Future smart aging models will use IoT, artificial intelligence, and big data technology to provide the elderly with more intelligent and personalized life services. For instance, smartwatches and health monitoring devices, designed ergonomically, will better suit the elderly's usage habits, while multi-functional community facilities will offer shared spaces for people of all ages. These designs not only enhance social inclusivity but also promote interaction and integration across generations.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion: The Deep Integration of Ergonomics and Society</h2>
            <p>From "Digital Detox" to "Digital Health," from traditional offices to third spaces, from the elderly to all ages, ergonomics is helping us address health challenges in the digital age through scientific designs and innovative solutions, reshaping diverse work environments, and driving the realization of an inclusive society. The future society will be smarter, more flexible, and more inclusive, and the widespread application of ergonomics is a crucial step toward achieving this goal.</p>
