            <h2>Cross-Disciplinary Integration: Redefining the Future of Immersive Audio-Visual Experiences</h2>
            <p>In our era of intertwined technology and culture, art forms are undergoing an unprecedented transformation. This transformation is not only evident in the innovation of stage design and performance methods but also in the profound reshaping of the relationship between the audience and the art. This article delves into the rise of immersive theatre, the voices of marginalized groups, and the cross-disciplinary integration of audio-visual experiences, exploring how these elements collaborate to construct a new era of art.</p>

            <h3>Immersive Theatre: Transcending Traditional Boundaries</h3>
            <p>The proscenium stage was once the standard form of theatre performance. However, with the diversification of audience aesthetic needs, immersive theatre has gradually become a new trend. Immersive theatre emphasizes audience participation and interaction, using multi-layered spatial design and flexible performance methods to allow audiences to freely move through performance spaces, even becoming part of the story. A typical example is "Sleep No More" produced by the British theatre company Punchdrunk, where audiences can freely wander through hotel rooms, interact closely with actors, and experience different storylines.</p>
            <p>Technological advancements provide strong support for the development of immersive theatre. The application of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and holographic projection technologies makes stage design more flexible and varied, allowing audiences to switch freely between different perspectives and scenes. Through VR technology, audiences can "enter" the story world, experiencing a stronger sense of immersion. Additionally, the use of wearable devices and real-time interactive systems makes interactions between the audience and actors more natural and fluid.</p>

            <h3>Focussing on Marginalized Groups: The Power of Social Resonance</h3>
            <p>In the rapid development of contemporary society, marginalized groups are often overlooked by mainstream society. These groups are not only part of social diversity but also crucial to understanding the full spectrum of society and driving social progress. Focusing on these marginalized groups can not only trigger social resonance but also prompt us to reflect on social injustice, driving social equity and justice.</p>
            <p>Marginalized groups often face multiple predicaments. Economic poverty makes it difficult for them to obtain basic living security, social weakness makes it lack of voice and influence, and cultural minority makes it hard to find self-identification in mainstream culture. However, these marginalized groups are not voiceless. Their voices may be weak, but they are real and powerful. They express their demands and wishes through various ways, hoping to be heard and understood by society.</p>
            <p>The power of social resonance lies in its ability to amplify individual voices, making them part of social consensus. When the voices of marginalized groups are heard and valued, social injustice and prejudice begin to be challenged and changed. This resonance is not only support for marginalized groups but also reflection and reconstruction of the entire social structure.</p>

            <h3>Cross-Disciplinary Integration: A New Era of Audio-Visual Experiences</h3>
            <p>"Cross-disciplinary integration" is breaking down the barriers between art and technology in an unprecedented manner, reshaping our experiences of audio-visual extravaganzas. This integration involves not only the innovation of art forms but also the redefinition of the relationship between the audience and performers, as well as between art and technology.</p>
            <p>Crossing disciplines is an inherent requirement of art. The dialogue between music and dance, the fusion of theatre and fine arts, the collision of literature and images, each interdisciplinary exploration is a journey to find resonance. It breaks the limitations of single art forms, allowing inspiration from different fields to interact, creating richer and more diverse artistic expressions. For example, from Lin Hwai-min's "Moonwater" to Wang Ya-bin's "The Red Dress," from "Raise the Red Lantern" to "Farewell My Concubine," cross-disciplinary integration has injected new vitality into art creation, providing the audience with deeper emotional experiences.</p>
            <p>Integration represents the infinite possibilities of technology. When artificial intelligence meets music creation, when virtual reality combines with theatre performance, when digital images intertwine with stage art, technology provides endless possibilities for the presentation of art. It can break the limitations of time and space, bringing the audience into an imaginative world; it can magnify the details of art works, allowing the audience to more genuinely feel the emotions and thoughts of artists; it can achieve interactive experiences, making the audience a part of the art creation.</p>
            <p>Cross-disciplinary integration is not a simple superposition but a chemical reaction of 1+1>2. It requires artists to have interdisciplinary knowledge, technical teams to understand and respect artistic creation, and both parties to collide in communication and cooperation. A successful cross-disciplinary integration case is the perfect combination of art and technology, capable of bringing the audience unprecedented audio-visual enjoyment and deeper reflections and resonances.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The rise of immersive theatre, the social resonance of focusing on marginalized groups, and the cross-disciplinary integration of audio-visual experiences together constitute a new era of art. Through the integration of technology, culture, and art, we not only redefine the relationship between the audience and art but also provide new possibilities for the survival and development of marginalized groups. In the future, with the continuous development and improvement of immersive theatre, we have reason to believe that art will be presented in more diverse and vivid ways, bringing us more resonance and reflections.</p>
