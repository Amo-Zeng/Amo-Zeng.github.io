            <h2>Comets: The Universe's "Time Capsule," Culture's "Dual Mirror," and the Galaxy's "Interstellar Messenger"</h2>
            <p>Comets, those celestial bodies with dazzling tails, not only captivate the night sky but also play multiple roles in science and culture. They are both "time capsules" from the birth of the solar system, carrying primordial materials from 4.6 billion years ago, and symbols of disaster and rebirth in human history. Moreover, they serve as "interstellar messengers" connecting the solar system and the galaxy. Through comets, we can glimpse the mysteries of the universe, understand the evolution of human psychology, and explore the exchange of materials and the spread of life within the galaxy.</p>

            <h3>Comets: The Solar System's "Time Capsule" and Primordial Memory</h3>
            <p>Comets are known as the "time capsules" of the universe because they preserve the original materials from the early stages of the solar system's formation. These materials are mainly found in the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud, where they remain largely undisturbed by subsequent evolutionary processes due to their distance from the Sun. When comets approach the Sun, their frozen materials vaporize, forming comas and tails. Scientists can analyze their composition through spectroscopy, revealing secrets from the infancy of the solar system.</p>
            <p>The Rosetta probe's exploration of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko discovered organic molecules such as glycine and phosphorus, key elements for life. This suggests that comets may have played a significant role in the origins of life on Earth by delivering organic materials. Additionally, the orbits and composition of comets provide important clues for studying the dynamics of the solar system's formation, helping us understand planetary formation mechanisms and the evolutionary history of the solar system.</p>

            <h3>Comets: Dual Identity in Culture and Psychological Evolution</h3>
            <p>Throughout human history, comets have been both omens of disaster and symbols of change and rebirth. Ancient civilizations often saw comets as manifestations of divine will. For example, the "Records of the Grand Historian" documented comets as harbingers of calamity, while the "Bayeux Tapestry" linked Halley's Comet to the Norman conquest of England. These cultural interpretations reflect humanity's anxiety toward the unknown and attempts to explain fate through celestial phenomena.</p>
            <p>In modern times, comets have gradually transformed from objects of fear to symbols of scientific exploration. The success of the Rosetta mission turned comets from mysterious celestial bodies into subjects of study. In science fiction, comets have become icons of interstellar travel, embodying humanity's awe and desire to conquer the mysteries of the cosmos. This cultural shift mirrors the psychological journey from superstition to rationality, seeking a balance between technology and imagination.</p>

            <h3>Comets: The Galaxy's "Interstellar Messenger" for Material Exchange</h3>
            <p>In recent years, the discovery of interstellar comets has provided opportunities to understand the composition of other star systems. The 2019 observation of Comet 2I/Borisov, moving at an extremely high velocity through the solar system, indicated its origin from distant interstellar space. Such interstellar objects challenge the traditional astronomical notion that all comets belong to the solar system, offering insights into the mechanisms of material exchange within the galaxy.</p>
            <p>By studying the orbits and composition of interstellar comets, scientists can infer the characteristics of their parent stars, expanding our understanding of galactic diversity. Furthermore, interstellar comets may carry materials from other star systems, including organic molecules or even microorganisms. These materials have undergone various physical and chemical changes during their interstellar journey, providing new clues in the search for extraterrestrial life. For instance, the orbital characteristics of Comet 2I/Borisov suggest it may have originated from a red dwarf system, where planets could potentially support life.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Multifaceted Identity of Comets and the Significance of Human Exploration</h3>
            <p>Comets are not only "time capsules" of the solar system's evolution but also "dual mirrors" of human culture and psychological evolution, as well as "interstellar messengers" connecting the solar system and the galaxy. Through the study of comets, we can explore the evolution of the universe, understand the transformations in human history, and investigate the exchange of materials and the spread of life within the galaxy. The multifaceted identity of comets enriches our understanding of the cosmos and inspires us to continually pursue the mysteries of the unknown.</p>
            <p>In the future, advancements in exploration technology will bring even deeper insights into the universe and life through comet research. Comets, these fateful lights traversing the cosmos, will continue to guide us in our journey through the vastness of the universe, exploring the intersections of science and culture, and revealing the profound connections between humanity and the cosmos.</p>
