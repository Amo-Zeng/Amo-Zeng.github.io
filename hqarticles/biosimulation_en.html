            <h3>I. Biologically Inspired Distributed Intelligence: From Natural Paradigms to AI Innovation</h3>
            <p>Biological systems in nature, such as ant colonies, bee swarms, and neural networks, are exemplars of distributed intelligence. These systems demonstrate remarkable adaptability and efficient task execution in complex environments through decentralized self-organizing mechanisms. In contrast, traditional AI systems often rely on centralized architectures, making them less capable of handling dynamically changing complex scenarios. Therefore, drawing inspiration from biological systems to construct distributed intelligent systems has become an important research direction in the field of AI.</p>
            <h4>1.1 Distributed Intelligence Mechanisms in Biological Systems</h4>
            <p>Intelligence in biological systems is manifested as collective wisdom, where individuals coordinate global behavior efficiently through simple local rules and interactions. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ant Colony Path Planning:</strong> Ants achieve globally optimal path planning without central control through pheromone release and local communication.</li>
                <li><strong>Distributed Information Processing in Neural Networks:</strong> Each neuron responds to local stimuli, yet the entire network can perform complex cognitive tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Organizing Behavior in Bee Colonies:</strong> Bees complete complex tasks like foraging and nest-building through simple rules without centralized command.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.2 Applications of Distributed Intelligence in AI</h4>
            <p>Inspired by biological systems, the AI field has begun exploring the construction of distributed intelligent systems, achieving significant progress:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ant Colony Optimization (ACO):</strong> Mimicking ant colony pheromone mechanisms, ACO achieves global optimal solutions through distributed local optimization, widely applied in path planning and combinatorial optimization.</li>
                <li><strong>Federated Learning:</strong> By decentralizing data to multiple nodes for training, it avoids data bottlenecks in centralized architectures, enhancing privacy and security.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Agent Systems (MAS):</strong> Drawing from the self-organizing behavior of biological groups, MAS uses multiple agents to collaborate on complex tasks, such as drone formations and intelligent transportation systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.3 Advantages and Challenges of Distributed Intelligence</h4>
            <p>Distributed intelligent systems offer the following notable advantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Robustness and Fault Tolerance:</strong> The system does not rely on a single node, offering high fault tolerance.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability and Flexibility:</strong> Computational power can be extended by adding nodes, adapting to dynamic environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy and Security:</strong> Data is stored across multiple nodes, reducing risks of single-point failures and privacy breaches.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, issues such as communication overhead, consistency maintenance, and complexity management in distributed systems still require further research and optimization.</p>
            <h4>1.4 Future Outlook</h4>
            <p>Future distributed intelligent systems will further integrate emerging technologies like quantum computing and edge computing to enhance adaptability and learning capabilities. At the same time, the application of distributed intelligence may raise ethical and societal issues, such as privacy protection and accountability, requiring collaboration between researchers and society.</p>
