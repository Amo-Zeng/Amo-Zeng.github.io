                <li><strong>Conflict and Turning Points</strong>: Show event development and changes in public reaction with real-time data to build suspense and climax.</li>
                <li><strong>Resolution and Insight</strong>: Provide solutions or future predictions through deep data analysis.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Character Development:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public Characters</strong>: Shape group representatives or typical reactions through social media data.</li>
                <li><strong>Expert Characters</strong>: Introduce research data and expert opinions to add authority to the story.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Emotional Connection:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong>: Incorporate public emotional responses into the story to resonate with readers.</li>
                <li><strong>Narrative Techniques</strong>: Use literary devices like first-person narrative, dialogues, to make the story more engaging.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>4. Data-Driven Interactive Experience:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interactive Charts</strong>: Allow readers to explore data based on their interest, enhancing personalized experience. For example, in articles about climate change, readers can select different countries to view temperature trends.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Data Display</strong>: Use animated charts to illustrate the process of data changes, helping readers understand complex data. For example, showing the impact of economic policies on cash flows.</li>
            </ul>
