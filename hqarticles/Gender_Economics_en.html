            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the 21st century, the importance of gender perspectives in various socio-economic fields is becoming increasingly evident. This article will explore gender differences and their impacts from three dimensions: digital finance, climate change, and entrepreneurship, and propose corresponding policy recommendations to achieve more equitable and inclusive social development.</p>

            <h2>1. Gender and Access and Use of Digital Finance</h2>
            <p>Digital finance has become an essential part of global economic activities, from mobile payments to online investments, from digital banking to fintech applications. Digital finance not only changes people's payment methods but also significantly promotes financial inclusion. However, gender differences in this field are particularly pronounced.</p>
            <h3>Current Situation and Causes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Economic Status and Income Levels:</strong> Women are often at a disadvantage in the labor market in many countries, with incomes generally lower than those of men, which limits their ability to access and use digital financial tools.</li>
                <li><strong>Educational Levels and Technical Knowledge:</strong> Women have relatively fewer educational opportunities, which directly affects their understanding and ability to use digital financial tools.</li>
                <li><strong>Social and Cultural Factors:</strong> In some social and cultural environments, women's roles in families and communities limit their economic activities, such as the belief in some cultures that women should not be involved in financial decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal and Policy Barriers:</strong> In some countries, women face more legal restrictions, such as property ownership and inheritance rights, which also affect their ability to use digital financial tools.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Impacts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> Gender differences not only limit women's economic opportunities but also affect the economic development of the entire society. Improving women's financial inclusion can promote economic growth and reduce poverty.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Impact:</strong> Unequal access to digital finance exacerbates gender inequality, affecting women's social status and rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Family Impact:</strong> In many families, women are the primary financial managers, and unequal access to digital finance limits their ability to manage household finances, affecting family well-being.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Policy Recommendations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improving Women's Economic Status:</strong> By providing more job opportunities and increasing women's income levels, enhance their economic independence.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening Education and Training:</strong> Governments and non-governmental organizations should increase efforts to educate and train women, especially in digital financial knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>Changing Social and Cultural Perceptions:</strong> Through media and education, change traditional perceptions of women's roles in society, encouraging women to participate in economic activities and financial decision-making.</li>
                <li><strong>Improving Laws and Policies:</strong> Develop and implement laws and policies that benefit women, eliminate gender discrimination, and protect women's property and inheritance rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Driving Technological Innovation:</strong> Develop more digital financial products and services suitable for women, such as simplifying operation processes and providing multilingual support, to lower the usage threshold.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Gender Perspectives on Climate Change and Economic Adaptation</h2>
            <p>Climate change is one of the most severe global challenges of the 21st century, with far-reaching and profound impacts. The introduction of a gender perspective provides a new dimension for understanding the impacts of climate change and its response strategies.</p>
            <h3>Special Impacts of Climate Change on Women</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Socioeconomic Status:</strong> Women have a lower status in socioeconomic structures, limited access to resources, and low participation in decision-making processes. For example, women are often responsible for agricultural production and water resource management in households, and extreme weather events caused by climate change directly impact these activities, increasing the workload and living pressures on women.</li>
            </ul>
