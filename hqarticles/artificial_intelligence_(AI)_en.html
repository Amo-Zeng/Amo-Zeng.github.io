            <h2>From "Tool" to "Companion": How AI Reshapes Emotional Connections</h2>
            <p>Initially seen as a tool to enhance efficiency and solve complex problems, AI technology has gradually evolved from a cold tool to a warm human companion, thanks to breakthroughs in affective computing and natural language processing (NLP). AI has now become an indispensable part of human emotional life.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Breakthroughs in Affective Computing and NLP:</strong> Affective computing enables AI to recognize and respond to human emotions. By analyzing voice, facial expressions, and emotional tones in text, AI not only senses human emotional states but also provides personalized emotional support.</li>
                <li><strong>Rise of AI Companions:</strong> AI companions, such as virtual girlfriends or boyfriends, are becoming a social phenomenon. These virtual companions can engage in everyday conversations and simulate human emotional responses, offering emotional companionship.</li>
                <li><strong>Philosophical and Ethical Challenges:</strong> The emotional connections between AI and humans raise profound philosophical and ethical questions. For instance, does AI possess true emotional understanding? How might AI companions change human intimate relationships?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>"Digital Immortality": How AI Challenges Human Perception of Death</h2>
            <p>AI not only changes our relationship with technology but also redefines the boundaries of life through the concept of "digital immortality," challenging traditional human perceptions of death.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>From Physical to Digital: The Possibility of "Immortality" through AI:</strong> The core of "digital immortality" lies in using AI technology to digitize human memories, consciousness, and personality, allowing these traits to continue in the virtual world.</li>
                <li><strong>Disruption of Death Perception: From Fear to Anticipation?:</strong> The advent of "digital immortality" is shaking fundamental human perceptions of death. AI advancements seem to offer a way to escape mortality.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Dilemmas: The Double-Edged Sword of Digital Immortality:</strong> While digital immortality provides a potential escape from death, it also raises significant ethical issues. For example, is the digitized "me" still "me"?</li>

            <h2>"Algorithmic Bias and Cultural Hegemony": How AI Shapes Cultural Identity in the Global Age</h2>
            <p>In the global age, AI not only plays a crucial role in emotional connections and life perception but also profoundly influences the formation and evolution of cultural identity through algorithmic bias and cultural hegemony.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic Bias: The Silent Engine of Cultural Hegemony:</strong> AI algorithms are not neutral tools; their functioning is deeply influenced by training data, cultural backgrounds, and values.</li>
                <li><strong>Reproduction of Cultural Hegemony: Power Restructuring in the Age of AI:</strong> AI is not just a technological tool but also a medium of power. Through algorithms and the distribution of cultural products, AI redefines the boundaries of cultural hegemony in the global age.</li>
                <li><strong>Countering Cultural Hegemony in the Age of AI: Exploring Diversity and Balance:</strong> Facing cultural hegemony in the age of AI, we need to adopt multi-faceted strategies to ensure that cultural identity in the global age truly reflects diversity and balance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>AI technology is profoundly transforming human life and perception in multiple dimensions: it evolves from a "tool" to a "companion," reshaping our ways of emotional connection, challenging traditional perceptions of death through "digital immortality," and redefining the boundaries of life. Meanwhile, AI's application in the global age also deeply influences the formation and evolution of cultural identity through algorithmic bias and cultural hegemony.</p>
