            <h2>Bertolt Brecht: Enlightenment of Theatrical Revolution and Social Change</h2>
            <p>In the theatrical landscape of the twentieth century, Bertolt Brecht revolutionized traditional dramatic concepts with his pioneering "Epic Theatre" theory and "Verfremdungseffekt" (Alienation Effect), sparking a theatrical revolution. This revolution was not only a transformation of theatrical form but also a redefinition of theatrical function, shifting drama from a mere tool for entertainment and illusion-making to a powerful weapon for social criticism and change. Brecht's theatrical theories and practices not only profoundly influenced the development of theatrical art but also provided ideological enlightenment and practical guidance for social change.</p>

            <h3>1. Disenchantment and Awakening: Brecht's End of Theatrical Illusion</h3>
            <p>Before Brecht, the mainstream of theatrical art was illusionism with the "fourth wall," where playwrights strove to construct a world on stage that seemed real, immersing the audience and making them forget reality. This illusionist theatrical aesthetics, from Ibsen to Chekhov, from Strindberg to Shaw, appeared to be the ultimate pursuit of theatrical art. However, Brecht's emergence was like a lightning bolt that shattered this seemingly self-evident theatrical concept.</p>
            <p>Through the "Alienation Effect," Brecht broke the closed space of the stage, forcing the audience to detach from an immersive dream. In "The Threepenny Opera," he used slogans and subtitles to break the spell of the "fourth wall," allowing the audience to stay清醒, no longer passively accepting the story on stage but actively thinking about the social issues revealed by the drama. This "alienation" was not a betrayal of theatrical craft but a redefinition of the relationship between reality and art. Brecht's drama became a stimulant, awakening the audience's critical consciousness towards reality.</p>
            <p>In "Life of Galileo," Brecht transformed historical events into universally meaningful social allegories through repeated scene recreations and character soliloquies. The audience no longer passively accepted a predetermined story outcome but pondered the connection between history and reality through constant alienation. This dramatic technique broke the shackles of traditional linear narrative, opening up new dimensions in theatrical expression. Brecht's genius lay in his acute awareness that theatre should not be a mere imitation of reality but a tool for reflecting on it.</p>

            <h3>2. From "Telling Stories" to "Speaking Truths": Brecht's Narrative Revolution</h3>
            <p>Brecht's theatrical revolution was not only reflected in the innovation of stage forms but also in the profound change in narrative methods. Traditional drama adhered to the "Catharsis Theory," bringing the audience into a fictional world through a complete story, allowing them to achieve purification and sublimation through emotional resonance. This "telling stories" model essentially dramatized real-world events, providing an imaginative solution through the ups and downs of the plot and the joys and sorrows of the characters, seeking solace in fiction.</p>
            <p>Brecht sharply questioned this. He believed that the traditional "telling stories" model was essentially a "hypnotic spell," numbing the audience's critical consciousness and making them indulge in the illusion of the story, ignoring the harsh reality. He advocated breaking the "fourth wall" and freeing drama from the shackles of "telling stories," shifting to "speaking truths."</p>
            <p>"Speaking truths" was not simply presenting facts but revealing the complexity and contradictions of reality in a dialectical and critical manner. Brecht's "Epic Theatre" employed the "Alienation Effect" to make familiar reality strange, compelling the audience to examine the social issues presented on stage with a clear mind and critical eye. Through techniques such as character debates, event pauses, and the narrator's intervention, Brecht's drama broke traditional linear narratives, guiding the audience to actively participate in thinking and judging reality within fragmented and open-ended narratives.</p>
            <p>Brecht's "speaking truths" did not seek a single, absolute truth but presented the diversity and dialectics of truth. He opposed any form of dogmatism and oversimplification, advocating the complexity of reality through contradictions and oppositions. This dialectical way of thinking enabled his drama to transcend simple moral preaching and become an art form that inspires thinking and critical consciousness.</p>

            <h3>3. The Stage as a Social Laboratory: Political Potential of Brecht's Theatre</h3>
            <p>Brecht was not only a theatrical innovator but also an enlightenment figure for social change. He regarded the stage as a social laboratory, using theatre to reveal social contradictions, stimulate rational thinking among the audience, and thus drive social change. Brecht's theatrical theories and practices contain immense political potential, opening up new possibilities for theatrical art.</p>
            <p>Brecht believed that theatre should not merely reflect reality but also become a weapon for criticizing it. He advocated that theatre should reveal social contradictions, show the conflicts and oppositions between different classes, thus provoking the audience's thinking and criticism of reality. In "The Threepenny Opera," Brecht revealed the corruption and evil of capitalist society with black humor, challenging the audience's traditional moral concepts.</p>
            <p>The "Alienation Effect" was designed to break the audience's immersive experience of the stage, forcing them to maintain a rational distance from the dramatic plot to independently think and judge. Through techniques such as narration, subtitles, and actors directly addressing the audience, Brecht reminded the audience that they were watching a performance, not reality itself. This "alienation" was not to alienate the audience but to make them more clearly recognize the social issues presented in the drama and actively participate in the process of social change.</p>
            <p>Brecht believed that theatre was not merely a form of entertainment but also an educational tool, transmitting knowledge and values to the audience and motivating them to take action. He emphasized that theatre should have practical significance, speak for the working class, and fight for social justice. Brecht's works often had a distinct political stance, using theatre to call for social change and unite people against oppression and injustice.</p>
