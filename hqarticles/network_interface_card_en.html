            <h3>Historical Evolution and Future Outlook</h3>
            <p><strong>Origins and the Advancement of Wired Technology</strong>: The origins of NICs can be traced back to the 1970s, initially serving as simple data transmission devices connecting mainframes to networks. With the rise of Ethernet technology, NICs began supporting higher data transfer speeds, from 10Mbps Ethernet to 100Mbps Fast Ethernet, and then to Gigabit and 10 Gigabit Ethernet, continuously enhancing their performance.</p>
            <p><strong>The Rise of Wireless Technology</strong>: Entering the 21st century, the rise of wireless networking technology enabled NICs to support wireless connections. The introduction of Wi-Fi technology allowed computers and other devices to access networks without physical connections.</p>

            <h3>Role in Modern Data Centers</h3>
            <p>In modern data centers, NICs are not only responsible for data transmission but also play a role in network virtualization, Quality of Service (QoS) management, and network security. High-performance NICs can significantly improve the overall efficiency and response speed of data centers.</p>
