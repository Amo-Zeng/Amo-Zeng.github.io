            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Against the backdrop of accelerating globalization, rapid digital technological advancements, and intensifying climate change, the world economy is undergoing profound structural transformation. Traditional economic models are intertwined with emerging economic forms, not only reshaping the underlying logic of economic operation but also posing new challenges to monetary policy, inflation management, and the labor market. **Attention Economy**, **Green Inflation**, and **Gig Economy** as the three core phenomena of this transformation, are profoundly influencing the macroeconomic mechanism. This article explores economic restructuring in the digital era from these three dimensions, analyzes their far-reaching impact on macroeconomics, and proposes corresponding policy innovation ideas.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Part One: Attention Economy and the Transformation of Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism</h2>
            <h3>1.1 The Rise of the Attention Economy: From Information Overload to Attention Scarcity</h3>
            <p>The information explosion in the digital era and the rapid development of platform economy have made people's attention a scarce resource. The core of the **Attention Economy** is to maximize commercial profits by competing for users' attention time and accurately delivering information, products, and services to target audiences. Platform companies use algorithms and big data analysis to continuously optimize content distribution strategies, attracting and maintaining users' attention.</p>
            <p>However, the prosperity of the Attention Economy has also brought significant negative effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information Overload Weakens Economic Signal Perception</strong>: Users find it difficult to identify important economic signals in a sea of information, such as changes in central bank monetary policy which may be drowned out by popular topics on social media;</li>
                <li><strong>Fragmented Information Affects Expectation Formation</strong>: Short-term, fragmented information更容易 influences the expectations of enterprises and consumers, weakening the effect of monetary policy's expectation guidance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.2 Challenges of the Attention Economy to the Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism</h3>
            <p>The traditional monetary policy transmission mechanism relies on economic agents' perception and reaction to policy signals. However, in an environment of attention scarcity, this mechanism faces severe challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weakened Perception of Economic Signals</strong>: Central bank policy signals may be diluted by entertaining or trending content on platforms, making it difficult for enterprises and consumers to obtain and accurately understand the policy intent in a timely manner;</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Difficulty in Expectation Guidance</strong>: Information overload causes economic agents to focus more on short-term fluctuations rather than long-term trends, thereby weakening the effect of monetary policy's expectation management.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.3 Digital Platform Advertising Expenditure and Economic Signal Distortion</h3>
            <p>Advertising, as a link between enterprises and consumers, is also an important carrier of economic signals. However, in the Attention Economy, fluctuations in advertising expenditure can distort economic signals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Impact of Reduced Advertising Expenditure</strong>: When enterprises cut advertising budgets due to tightening economic environments, platforms may maintain revenue by lowering content quality or increasing advertising frequency, making economic signals more ambiguous;</li>
                <li><strong>Signal Distortion Amplified by Platform Monopolies</strong>: The monopoly position of large platforms enhances their influence on economic signals, potentially further distorting economic signals and weakening the effectiveness of monetary policy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.4 Monetary Policy Innovation in Response to the Attention Economy</h3>
            <p>To address the challenges posed by the Attention Economy, central banks need to innovate monetary policy tools and communication methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Collaborating with Mainstream Platforms to Publish Policy Information</strong>: Central banks can publish important policy information through digital platforms to ensure widespread and timely policy outreach;</li>
                <li><strong>Utilizing Diversified Communication Formats</strong>: Adopt intuitive formats such as charts and short videos to interpret monetary policy, helping users better understand policy intent;</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening Research on the Platform Economy</strong>: Explore ways to incorporate the platform economy into the monetary policy regulatory framework to enhance the precision and effectiveness of monetary policy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Part Two: Green Inflation: Dual Challenges of Climate Change and Economic Transition</h2>
            <h3>2.1 The Economic Cost of Green Transition: The Inevitable Path from High Carbon to Low Carbon</h3>
            <p>Pushed by the global "carbon neutrality" goals, countries are accelerating green transition, which inevitably comes with rising economic costs, leading to **Green Inflation**:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Costs of Energy Structure Adjustment</strong>: The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy involves high costs due to the immaturity of new energy technologies and the high investment in supporting infrastructure, pushing up energy prices;</li>
                <li><strong>Introduction of Carbon Pricing Mechanisms</strong>: The implementation of carbon taxes and carbon trading systems increases the costs of high-carbon enterprises, which are then transmitted through the supply chain to final consumer goods, further driving up inflation;</li>
                <li><strong>Transformation Pressure on High-carbon Industries</strong>: High-carbon industries such as steel and cement need to invest heavily in technological upgrades, with these transformation costs ultimately passed on to consumers through product prices.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.2 Economic Impact of Climate Events: Extreme Weather Intensifies Inflation Pressure</h3>
            <p>Extreme weather events caused by climate change have巨大冲击 global supply chains, further pushing up inflation levels:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Agricultural Production Disruptions</strong>: Extreme weather such as floods and droughts leads to food production declines, driving up international food prices;</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Supply Interruptions</strong>: Extreme weather may damage energy infrastructure, causing energy shortages and pushing up energy prices;</li>
                <li><strong>Supply Chain Bottlenecks</strong>: Extreme weather damages transportation infrastructure, causing supply chain disruptions and pushing up logistics costs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.3 Policy Responses to Green Inflation: Adjustments to the Monetary Policy Framework</h3>
            <p>In the face of the challenges of Green Inflation, the traditional monetary policy framework needs to undergo innovative adjustments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limitations of the Traditional Framework</strong>: Traditional monetary policy primarily focuses on overall inflation levels, overlooking structural factors of inflation;</li>
                <li><strong>Exploration of Green Inflation Targets</strong>: Central banks can set green inflation targets, focusing on the prices of commodities such as energy and food that are greatly affected by climate change;</li>
                <li><strong>Synergistic Efforts of Multiple Policies</strong>: In addition to monetary policy, fiscal and industrial policies need to be coordinated, such as increasing R&D support for clean energy and improving carbon pricing mechanisms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Part Three: Gig Economy: Labor Market Uncertainty and Tax Challenges</h2>
            <h3>3.1 The Rise of the Gig Economy: A New Employment Form in the Platform Economy</h3>
            <p>With the普及 of digital technologies, the Gig Economy has rapidly developed as a new employment form, encompassing various professions such as ride-hailing drivers, food delivery riders, and freelancers. However, the prosperity of the Gig Economy also hides macroeconomic challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Income Instability and Consumption-Savings Behavior</strong>: Gig workers experience significant income volatility, leading to increased savings tendencies and suppressing consumption demand, negatively impacting economic growth;</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Social Security</strong>: Gig workers lack a comprehensive social security system, potentially increasing future government fiscal burdens.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.2 Tax Challenges in the Platform Economy</h3>
            <p>The virtualization and decentralization of the platform economy make traditional tax collection methods difficult to effectively cover:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increased Difficulty in Tax Collection</strong>: Platform companies and gig workers may exploit tax loopholes to evade taxes, leading to tax revenue loss;</li>
                <li><strong>Impact of Reduced Government Revenue</strong>: Tax revenue loss compresses government fiscal space, affecting investment in public services.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.3 Policy Responses to the Gig Economy</h3>
            <p>To address the challenges posed by the Gig Economy, governments need to approach labor regulations, tax systems, and policy support:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Optimizing Labor Regulations</strong>: Clarify the legal status of gig workers, establish a flexible social security system, and protect their basic rights;</li>
                <li><strong>Improving Tax Systems</strong>: Utilize technologies such as big data to achieve full-chain tax supervision of the platform economy;</li>
                <li><strong>Implementing Targeted Policy Support</strong>: Use monetary policy tools such as targeted reserve requirement cuts and re-lending to support the development of the Gig Economy; encourage platform companies to provide training and insurance benefits for gig workers through fiscal subsidies.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Economic restructuring in the digital era is profoundly changing the global economic operational model. The **Attention Economy** poses new challenges to the monetary policy transmission mechanism, **Green Inflation** becomes a dual test of climate change and economic transition, and the **Gig Economy** brings unprecedented impacts to the labor market and tax systems.
