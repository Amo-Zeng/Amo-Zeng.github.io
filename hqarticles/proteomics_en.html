            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Proteins are the central executors of life activities, and their diversity and complexity are crucial for biological processes. Proteomics, as the science studying all proteins in a cell, tissue, or organism at a specific time and under certain conditions, not only provides information on the final products of gene expression but also reveals the functions, modifications, and interactions of these proteins. Through proteomics, we can explore its applications in early disease diagnosis, personalized medicine, and biological adaptation to environments from multiple perspectives.</p>

            <h3>The Role of Proteomics in Early Disease Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>The application of proteomics in disease diagnosis mainly manifests in several aspects:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Discovery of Biomarkers:</strong> By comparing proteomic data between healthy and diseased individuals, researchers can identify proteins related to specific diseases. For example, Aβ and Tau proteins in Alzheimer's disease, PSA in prostate cancer. These markers are not only used for diagnosis but can also provide early warnings years before symptoms appear.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> The key role of Aβ and Tau proteins in Alzheimer's disease.</li>
                        <li><em>Application:</em> These biomarkers can be used to develop strategies for disease prevention and monitoring.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Early Warning Systems:</strong> Utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence, proteomic data can build predictive models to identify early signs of diseases. For instance, monitoring plasma proteome profiles can predict the risk of cardiovascular diseases.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Technique:</em> Application of machine learning and AI in proteomic data analysis.</li>
                        <li><em>Significance:</em> Early warning allows for preventive interventions, reducing the occurrence and progression of diseases.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Personalized Treatment Plans:</strong> Analysis of proteomic data provides the basis for personalized therapy. Understanding the specific protein expression patterns in patients allows for the selection of the most suitable drugs or treatment strategies, enhancing efficacy and reducing side effects.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Case:</em> Improvement in outcomes for HER2-positive breast cancer patients through targeted therapy.</li>
                        <li><em>Advantage:</em> Reducing side effects of treatments, improving patient quality of life.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ol>

            <h3>Proteomics and Customized Healthcare</h3>
            <p>Proteomics further enhances the precision of healthcare in personalized medicine:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Understanding Disease Mechanisms:</strong> Proteomics can more precisely understand how genetic mutations affect protein function, thus identifying new therapeutic targets.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Research Method:</em> Using mass spectrometry to detect changes in proteins.</li>
                        <li><em>Application:</em> Discovering new drug targets, driving drug development.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Drug Development:</strong> Proteomics aids in developing drugs targeting specific proteins, like HER2 inhibitors, to achieve targeted therapy.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> Use of Trastuzumab (Herceptin) in HER2-positive breast cancer.</li>
                        <li><em>Benefit:</em> Enhancing the specificity and efficacy of treatments.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Monitoring Treatment Effects:</strong> During treatment, proteomics can be used to assess the efficacy of treatments and gauge the risk of disease recurrence.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Monitoring Means:</em> Dynamic monitoring of protein changes within patients.</li>
                        <li><em>Purpose:</em> Timely adjustment of treatment plans to prevent disease relapse.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Reducing Resource Waste:</strong> By predicting individual responses to drugs, unnecessary treatments are avoided, conserving medical resources.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Application:</em> Combining pharmacogenomics with proteomics to predict drug response.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
