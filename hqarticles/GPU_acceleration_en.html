            <p>The birth of GPUs originated from the increasing demand for graphics processing, but their parallel processing capabilities far exceed traditional CPUs in dealing with large-scale data and complex computational tasks. In this stage, GPUs primarily drive technological progress by enhancing computational power, from scientific computing and data analysis to the training of artificial intelligence models. The application of GPUs has significantly improved computational efficiency, accelerating technological innovation. However, the mere enhancement of computational power is no longer sufficient to meet the demands of the future intelligent era. With the deepening development of artificial intelligence technology, the pursuit of cognitive capabilities has become a new focus. Cognitive intelligence not only requires efficient computational power but also the ability to understand, reason, and make decisions based on data.</p>
            <p>The evolution of GPUs is gradually shifting from pure computational power enhancement to supporting higher levels of cognitive intelligence. The key to this transformation lies in the further optimization of GPU architecture and the innovation of software algorithms. Firstly, GPU architecture design needs to be more flexible to support complex cognitive tasks. For example, current GPU architectures have begun to integrate dedicated AI processing units (such as NVIDIA's Tensor Core), which are specifically designed to accelerate tensor operations in deep learning, thereby improving the processing efficiency of cognitive tasks. Secondly, the innovation of software algorithms is also an important factor in driving the evolution of GPUs from computational power to cognitive intelligence. Traditional machine learning algorithms primarily rely on large amounts of data and computational resources, but future cognitive intelligence requires more efficient algorithms to achieve deep data understanding. For example, new algorithms such as Graph Neural Networks (GNN) can not only handle large-scale data but also deeply explore the relationships between data, thereby achieving higher levels of cognitive reasoning.</p>
