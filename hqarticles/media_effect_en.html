            <h2>Reconstructing Media Effects: From Materiality to Agency, Crossing Cultural Boundaries</h2>
            <p>In the era of information, media is no longer merely a tool for transmitting information but a complex force shaping cognition, influencing social structures, and facilitating cultural exchanges. Traditional media effect studies often focus on the one-way impact of content on audiences, ignoring the materiality of media itself and its significant role in shaping information flow, social cognition, and power relations. Meanwhile, audience agency and media effects in cross-cultural communication have not been adequately explored. This article will comprehensively discuss these three perspectives, deeply analyzing how media materiality, audience agency, and cross-cultural communication together shape media effects in modern society.</p>

            <h3>Media Materiality: Bridging Technology and Society</h3>
            <p>The materiality of media is not merely the realization at the technical level but also a reflection of social power relations and cultural production. Media infrastructures such as printing technology, network protocols, and social media algorithms not only determine the efficiency of information transmission but also influence the freedom and openness of information flow, thereby shaping our cognitive frameworks of the world.</p>

                <li><strong>Case Study: Visual Language of Super Bowl Ads</strong> - The success of Super Bowl ads relies not only on creative content but also on a profound understanding and clever utilization of media materiality. Through specific visual languages and narrative structures, ads use the format, color saturation, and sound effects of television screens to manipulate the audience's emotional responses, thereby shaping brand images.</li>
                <li><strong>Theoretical Framework: Archival Media Studies and Material Culture Research</strong> - Combining archival media studies and material culture research, we can analyze more deeply how media infrastructures shape our cognitive frameworks of the world.</li>

            <h3>Audience Agency: The Rise of Participatory Culture</h3>
            <p>Audiences are not passive recipients of media content but actively choose, interpret, and resist media content. How audiences exert agency and interact with media technologies to create new meanings and values is an essential aspect of media effect research.</p>

            <h3>Cross-Cultural Communication: Building Bridges or Creating Barriers?</h3>
            <p>In today's rapidly globalizing world, media plays a crucial role in cross-cultural communication. Different media technologies, content, and usage habits not only affect the depth and breadth of cultural exchange but also build bridges or create barriers, influencing the processes of cultural conflict and integration.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Multi-Dimensional Reconstruction of Media Effects</h3>
            <p>Media materiality, audience agency, and cross-cultural communication together form a multi-dimensional framework of modern media effects. Media materiality reveals the significant role of media technology in shaping social cognition and power relations, audience agency emphasizes the initiative and creativity of audiences in media practices, and cross-cultural communication explores the bridging and barrier-creating roles of media across different cultures. These perspectives not only enrich the research field of media effects but also provide new perspectives for understanding and coping with the complexity of modern society.</p>
