                <strong>Abstract</strong>: Driven by the dual national strategies of ecological civilization and common prosperity, China's eco-poverty alleviation is undergoing a paradigm shift from "resource compensation" to "capital appreciation." Based on <strong>ecological capital theory</strong> (Costanza et al., 1997) and <strong>institutional change theory</strong> (North, 1990), this paper proposes a tripartite analytical framework of "technology-culture-institution" synergistic transition. By integrating cutting-edge practices such as Ganzi's "Ecological Bank" and Guangxi's "Carbon Sink + Poverty Alleviation," it reveals institutional innovation pathways in eco-poverty alleviation. The study finds that the essence of eco-poverty alleviation lies in the <strong>institutional reconfiguration of ecological capital</strong>, whose success depends on the systemic coupling of property rights clarification, cultural legitimacy, and market accessibility. Finally, the paper constructs an "ecological bank"-style governance paradigm and offers actionable policy recommendations, providing theoretical support and practical pathways for the synergistic governance of poverty reduction and carbon neutrality.

        <section>
            <h2 class="section-title">I. Theoretical Framework: Institutional Change and Capital Reconfiguration in Eco-Poverty Alleviation</h2>
            <p>The profound transformation of eco-poverty alleviation is not merely an iteration of policy tools, but a systemic project of <strong>institutionalization of ecological capital</strong>. This paper presents an integrative theoretical framework, grounded in <strong>ecological capital theory</strong> and <strong>institutional change theory</strong>, to uncover the internal mechanisms of the triple leap.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">1. Ecological Capital Theory: The Foundation for Valuing Ecosystems</h3>
            <p>Costanza et al. (1997) in their seminal <em>Nature</em> study on global ecosystem service valuation estimated that the annual value of global ecosystem services reaches $33 trillion—surpassing global GDP. This discovery shattered the traditional notion of "nature as valueless," establishing the legitimacy of <strong>ecological capital</strong> as a factor of production. Ecological capital comprises four categories of services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Provisioning services</strong> (e.g., water, medicinal plants)</li>
                <li><strong>Regulating services</strong> (e.g., carbon sequestration, flood mitigation)</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural services</strong> (e.g., ecotourism, spiritual value)</li>
                <li><strong>Supporting services</strong> (e.g., soil formation, biodiversity)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, due to <strong>ambiguous property rights, non-excludability, and strong externalities</strong>, ecological capital has long remained in a state of "value submersion," leading to the "tragedy of the commons" and the "ecological poverty trap."</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">2. Institutional Change Theory: From Path Dependence to Institutional Innovation</h3>
            <p>North (1990) emphasized that institutions are rule systems that reduce transaction costs, define property rights, and shape incentives. The realization of ecological capital value must rely on <strong>institutional innovation</strong> to break path dependence:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Formal institutions</strong> (e.g., carbon trading rules, ecological compensation mechanisms)</li>
                <li><strong>Informal institutions</strong> (e.g., ecological beliefs, community norms)</li>
                <li><strong>Implementation mechanisms</strong> (e.g., digital platforms, cooperatives)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>North's theory of the "<strong>institutional matrix</strong>" further posits that <strong>institutional change becomes possible</strong> when <strong>technological change</strong> (e.g., blockchain, remote sensing) reduces information costs, <strong>cultural cognition</strong> (e.g., rising ecological awareness) alters behavioral preferences, and <strong>institutional supply</strong> (e.g., carbon markets, ecological banks) provides incentive structures.</p>

        <section>
            <h2 class="section-title">II. Technological Leap: Digital Technologies Drive Property Rights Clarification and Governance Reconfiguration</h2>
            <p>The technological leap is the critical breakthrough enabling ecological capital to transition from "invisible" to "measurable." Its essence lies in <strong>digital technologies reducing transaction costs</strong>, transforming ecological capital from public goods into quasi-private assets.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">(1) Blockchain + IoT: The "Trinity Separation" of Ecological Asset Rights</h3>
            <p>The "Ecological Cloud Chain" pilot in Guizhou's Leigong Mountain employs <strong>blockchain + IoT + remote sensing</strong> technologies to convert forest, water, and wetland resources into <strong>digital asset packages</strong>, enabling:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ownership</strong> (state/collective)</li>
                <li><strong>Usage rights</strong> (contracting households/cooperatives)</li>
                <li><strong>Benefit rights</strong> (carbon sink dividends, ecological compensation)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through smart contracts, carbon sink revenues are automatically distributed to villagers' digital wallets, reducing transaction costs by <strong>72%</strong> (2023 evaluation data), solving the traditional problem of "layer-by-layer siphoning" in ecological compensation.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">(2) Ganzi, Sichuan: "Ecological Bank" — A Digital Operation Platform for Ecological Assets</h3>
            <p>The <strong>Ganzi Prefecture "Ecological Bank" Pilot</strong> (China's first provincial-level ecological capital operation platform), launched in 2022, further upgrades the model:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Establishes <strong>"Ecological Asset Digital Accounts"</strong>, integrating grassland, wetland, and forest data;</li>
                <li>Introduces <strong>AI valuation models</strong> for dynamic assessment of ecosystem service values;</li>
                <li>Develops the <strong>"Ecological Bank" APP</strong>, enabling villagers to monitor asset returns and apply for carbon sink-backed loans.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>2023 data shows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Total ecological asset value in pilot areas increased by <strong>35%</strong>;</li>
                <li>Per capita ecological income reached <strong>2,800 RMB/year</strong>;</li>
                <li>Ecological capital-backed loans exceeded <strong>120 million RMB</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">(3) Governance Redistribution: From "Government-Led" to "Polycentric Co-Governance"</h3>
            <p>The technological leap reshapes governance structures. Under the "Ecological Bank" model, a <strong>"government-platform-community-third party"</strong> quadripartite governance structure emerges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Government</strong>: Rule-setting and compliance oversight;</li>
                <li><strong>Platform</strong> (e.g., ecological bank): Asset valuation and transaction facilitation;</li>
                <li><strong>Community</strong>: Participation in decision-making and benefit distribution;</li>
                <li><strong>Third parties</strong> (NGOs, research institutions): Monitoring, evaluation, and cultural empowerment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This model aligns with North's assertion that "<strong>institutional efficiency arises from decentralization and incentive compatibility</strong>," but also requires vigilance against <strong>digital exclusion</strong> that may marginalize vulnerable groups.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 class="section-title">III. Cultural Leap: Modern Activation of Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Ecological Memory</h2>
            <p>Ecological capital carries not only economic value but also <strong>cultural legitimacy</strong>. The cultural leap centers on transforming <strong>Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)</strong> into the cultural foundation of ecological capital, achieving "<strong>technologizing culture, and capitalizing culture</strong>."</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">(1) The Triple Value of Traditional Ecological Knowledge</h3>
            <p>Berkes (1999) defines TEK as long-term adaptive knowledge systems with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ecological value</strong>: e.g., Hani terraced fields' "forest-village-terrace-water system" vertical structure, ensuring soil conservation and biodiversity;</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural value</strong>: e.g., Dong people's "sacred mountain taboos," forming informal conservation mechanisms;</li>
                <li><strong>Economic value</strong>: e.g., Guangxi Longji's "rice-fish-duck co-culture," yielding <strong>40% higher output per unit area</strong> than monoculture.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">(2) Guangxi's "Carbon Sink + Poverty Alleviation": Synergistic Value-Addition through Culture and Technology</h3>
            <p>The <strong>Longji Terraced Fields "Carbon Sink Cultural Cooperative"</strong> (2021) introduces an innovative model:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrates traditional water systems into <strong>carbon sink monitoring networks</strong>, enabling "quantification of cultural-system carbon sequestration";</li>
                <li>Allocates <strong>20%</strong> of carbon sink revenue to an "<strong>Ecological Ritual Fund</strong>" to support traditional ceremonies like "Water Worship Festival" and "Plowing Festival";</li>
                <li>Youth engaged in carbon management receive "<strong>Ecological Cultural Inheritor</strong>" certification, increasing return-to-village rates by <strong>35%</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>2023 data: Carbon sink revenue increased by <strong>40%</strong>, cultural identity index rose by <strong>28%</strong>, forming a virtuous cycle of "<strong>carbon sinks nourish culture, culture protects ecology</strong>."</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">(3) "Cultural Alignment" Mechanism: Legitimizing Technology Through Cultural Embeddedness</h3>
            <p>In Hani terraces, solar water pumps require a "<strong>water worship ritual</strong>" before installation, embedding technology in cultural meaning. In Ganzi, the Ecological Bank APP integrates Tibetan script and Thangka art, enhancing user identification. This "<strong>cultural alignment</strong>" mechanism is crucial for technology adoption, echoing Costanza's warning that "<strong>ecological capital must be embedded within socio-cultural structures</strong>."</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 class="section-title">IV. Institutional Leap: Carbon Sink Trading Chains and Synergistic Governance of Poverty Reduction and Carbon Neutrality</h2>
            <p>The institutional leap is the final stage for <strong>value realization</strong> of ecological capital. Its core is building a <strong>tradable, redistributable, and sustainable</strong> carbon sink poverty alleviation mechanism.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">(1) Institutional Innovation: From "Carbon Tickets" to "Carbon Sink Chains"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sanming, Fujian's "Carbon Ticket System"</strong>: Quantifies forest carbon sinks as "carbon tickets," tradable, pledgeable, and dividend-paying;</li>
                <li><strong>Puer, Yunnan's "Agroforestry Carbon Sinks"</strong>: Integrates rubber-tea intercropping into CCER projects, enhancing carbon density;</li>
                <li><strong>Kubuqi, Inner Mongolia's "Carbon Sink-Backed Loans"</strong>: Herders use grassland carbon sinks as collateral for low-interest loans for ecological restoration.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">(2) Institutional Deepening of Ganzi's "Ecological Bank"</h3>
            <p>Building on technology and culture, Ganzi's pilot introduces three institutional innovations:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Carbon Sink Revenue Insurance Fund</strong>: Co-established by local government and insurers to hedge against carbon price volatility, ensuring stable redistribution;</li>
                <li><strong>Smallholder "Regional Bundled Registration" Mechanism</strong>: Bundles dispersed smallholder carbon projects for CCER registration, reducing costs by <strong>60%</strong>;</li>
                <li><strong>"Carbon Sink Ritual" System</strong>: Allocates <strong>10%</strong> of annual carbon revenue to ecological rituals, reinforcing community participation.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>2023 data: Carbon sink revenue stability improved by <strong>60%</strong>, with <strong>85%</strong> of ecological capital value realized.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">VI. Conclusion: Toward the Institutional Reconfiguration of Ecological Capital</h2>
            <p>The paradigm revolution in eco-poverty alleviation is, at its core, an <strong>institutional reconfiguration of ecological capital</strong>. This reconfiguration is not merely technological stacking or policy patching, but a tripartite synergy grounded in <strong>ecological capital theory</strong> as the value foundation and <strong>institutional change theory</strong> as the pathway guide: <strong>technological leap</strong> enables property rights clarification, <strong>cultural leap</strong> confers legitimacy, and <strong>institutional leap</strong> realizes value.</p>
            <p>In the future, eco-poverty alleviation will evolve into the "<strong>Ecological Bank 2.0</strong>" era—an integrated ecological capital operation platform combining <strong>digital property rights, cultural empowerment, market trading, risk hedging, and revenue redistribution</strong>. Under this paradigm:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Poverty reduction is no longer a cost of ecology, but the starting point of ecological appreciation;</li>
                <li>Carbon neutrality is no longer an external constraint, but an internal incentive;</li>
                <li>The tensions between tradition and modernity, individual and collective, human and nature, are transformed into a <strong>narrative of coexistence and shared prosperity</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="quote"><strong>Ultimate Goal</strong>: Let every forest, every wetland, every sacred mountain become <strong>measurable, tradable, and inheritable ecological capital</strong>, illuminating the path to common prosperity under the light of institutions.</p>
