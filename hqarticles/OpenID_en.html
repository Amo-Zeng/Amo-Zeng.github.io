        <section>
            <h3>Basic Concepts and Advantages of OpenID</h3>
            <p>OpenID is a decentralized identity verification system aimed at allowing users to log into multiple platforms with a single digital identity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Convenience:</strong> Users do not need to remember multiple passwords, greatly simplifying the login process.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Burden for Service Providers:</strong> Service providers do not need to maintain complex user databases.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Through centralized authentication services, users can manage and protect their identity information more effectively.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
