        </section>

            <h3>Introduction: The "Trilemma" of Data Modeling and the Inevitability of Paradigm Upgrade</h3>
            <p>In the data-driven era, machine learning models have become the core engine for business decision-making, scientific discovery, and engineering optimization. However, traditional data modeling paradigms face an increasingly severe "trilemma":</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>"Black-Box Dilemma"</strong>: The more powerful the model (e.g., deep neural networks), the more its decision-making process resembles an incomprehensible "black box." In high-value decision-making scenarios (e.g., finance, healthcare, judiciary), the lack of explainability leads to a <strong>trust crisis</strong>, hindering the practical application of AI.</li>
                <li><strong>"Data Dilemma"</strong>: In many critical fields (e.g., aerospace, energy, biopharmaceuticals), obtaining high-quality, fully annotated data is extremely costly or difficult. Purely data-driven models suffer from <strong>"data hunger"</strong> and struggle to survive in a "small data" world.</li>
                <li><strong>"Static Dilemma"</strong>: Traditional models are static "snapshots," predicting the future based solely on historical data. But in a dynamic, non-stationary real world where the environment constantly changes (user interest shifts, market fluctuations, physical evolution), static models quickly become "obsolete," trapped in the dilemma of <strong>"cold start" and "distribution shift"</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This trilemma collectively points to a fundamental issue: <strong>What we need is no longer a "high-performance" but "unknowable" prediction tool, but a "trustworthy, scientific, and evolving" intelligent system</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Paradigm 1: Explainability — Building the Trust Foundation for "Human-Machine Collaborative" Decision-Making</h3>
            <p><strong>Core Challenge</strong>: How to transform the model from a "black box" into an "auditable, debatable decision-making partner"?</p>
            <p><strong>Paradigm Breakthrough</strong>: <strong>Redefining the value of a model from "prediction accuracy" to "decision trustworthiness and collaboration."</strong> A model with 99% accuracy that cannot be explained may be less valuable in critical decisions than a model with 95% accuracy that can clearly explain "why."</p>

            </ul>
            
            <h4>Practical Value: Wind Turbine Blade Flow Field Modeling Case Study</h4>
            <p>Demonstrates how the dual-driven model, with only a small amount of wind tunnel data, achieves better prediction accuracy than a purely data-driven model (error < 5% vs > 15%), stronger extrapolation capability, and 1000x computational efficiency improvement.</p>

            <p><strong>Paradigm Breakthrough</strong>: <strong>Redefining the value of a model from "passive prediction" to "active learning and long-term optimization."</strong></p>
            
            <h4>Technical Path: Closed-Loop System of Perception-Decision-Action-Feedback</h4>

            <h3>Conclusion: Redefining the "Intelligence" Connotation of Data Modeling</h3>
            <p>The paradigm revolution in data modeling signifies a fundamental shift in the connotation of "intelligence":</p>
            <ul>
                <li>From <strong>"High-Performance Prediction"</strong> to <strong>"Trustworthy Decision-Making"</strong> (Explainability).</li>
                <li>From <strong>"Data Hunger"</strong> to <strong>"Scientific Reliability"</strong> (Dual-Driven).</li>
                <li>From <strong>"Static Snapshot"</strong> to <strong>"Active Evolution"</strong> (Interactive Modeling).</li>

            <p>This is not only a technological breakthrough but also an integration of <strong>methodology, organizational processes, and ethical responsibility</strong>. In the future, a qualified data model must possess explainability, scientificity, and interactivity to truly become a "strategic collaborative partner" driving business decisions, scientific discovery, and engineering optimization.</p>
