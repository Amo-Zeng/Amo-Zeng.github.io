            <h2>Introduction: Numbers Are Not Just Objects—They Are Speakers</h2>
            <p>In formal languages and mathematical logic, integers often appear as <strong>encoded objects</strong> (e.g., Gödel numbers), yet their role as <strong>primitive symbols</strong> with the capacity to "speak" has not been sufficiently explored. This essay treats integer strings (such as "123") as <strong>atomic symbol strings</strong> within a formal language, analyzing their <strong>grammatical self-reference</strong>—how a number string can describe its own structure—and the resulting semantic paradoxes. This is not merely a technical construction, but a deeper philosophical inquiry into the proposition that <em>"numbers are symbols."</em></p>

            <h3>1. Constructing a Formal Language System: A Framework for Self-Referential Syntax</h3>
            <p>We define an <strong>integer syntax language</strong> $ \mathcal{L}_{\mathbb{Z}} $, with alphabet $ \Sigma = \{0,1,2,\ldots,9\} $, and strings as finite non-empty sequences of digits (leading zeros are allowed for structural analysis).</p>

            <h4>Definition 1 (Syntactic Roles)</h4>
            <p>Each digit string $ w \in \mathcal{L}_{\mathbb{Z}} $ plays a dual role:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Symbolic role</strong>: As a representation of an integer; e.g., $ w = "12" $ denotes the integer 12.</li>
                <li><strong>Grammatical role</strong>: As a <strong>descriptor</strong>, whose sequence of characters can refer to the structure of other digit strings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Definition 2 (Rules of Self-Referential Syntax)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decomposition Rule</strong>: For $ w = d_k d_{k-1} \ldots d_1 $, define its <strong>explicit decomposition</strong> as $ \text{Decomp}(w) = \{d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k\} $, i.e., the set of its individual digits.</li>
                <li><strong>Recursive Description</strong>: Strings may refer to themselves via <strong>digit encoding</strong>. For example, define a function $ \text{Code}(w) $ that maps $ w $ to a unique integer (e.g., via lexicographic ordering), so that $ w $ can "describe" $ \text{Code}(w) $.</li>
                <li><strong>Meta-Syntactic Construction</strong>: Introduce <strong>syntactic markers</strong> (e.g., parentheses, delimiters) through implicit encoding. For instance, the string $ w = "1(2)3" $ may be interpreted as "1, with 2 inside parentheses, followed by 3," meaning $ w $ describes a structure: digit 1, a nested structure 2, and digit 3.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Self-Referential Constructions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Self-Encoding Strings</strong>: A string $ w $ is <strong>self-encoding</strong> if there exists $ n $ such that the numerical value of $ w $ equals $ \text{Code}(w) $, i.e., $ \text{val}(w) = \text{Code}(w) $.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Decomposing Strings</strong>: A string $ w $ is <strong>self-decomposing</strong> if the set of its characters equals the result of "describing" its individual digits. For example, $ w = "11" $ may be interpreted as "1 appears 1 time," where "1" is described as "appearing 1 time," forming a self-reference.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Definition 3 (Shortest Description Function)</h4>
            <p>Define $ \text{SD}(n) $ as the shortest string (by length) that represents the integer $ n $, allowing recursive descriptions. For example, $ n = 123456789 $ may be described as "consecutive digits from 1 to 9," whose length is much less than 9.</p>

            <h3>2. Syntactic Paradoxes Arising from Self-Reference</h3>
            <p>Within $ \mathcal{L}_{\mathbb{Z}} $, self-referential constructions give rise to three core paradoxes:</p>

            <h4>Paradox 1: The Shortest Description Length Paradox (SD Paradox)</h4>
            <p>Construct a string $ w $ satisfying:</p>
            <blockquote>“$ w $ is the shortest description of $ \text{SD}(n) $, where $ n $ is the numerical value of $ w $.”</blockquote>
            <p>That is: $ w $ describes a number $ n = \text{val}(w) $, and $ w $ is the shortest description of $ n $. But if $ w $ is the shortest description of $ n $, then $ |w| \leq \text{SD}(n) $, while $ w $ also "describes" $ \text{SD}(n) $, so $ w $ must be long enough to encode $ \text{SD}(n) $, leading to a contradiction: <strong>a string cannot be both short and fully describe its own description length</strong>.</p>
            <p>Formally: If $ w $ satisfies $ w = \text{SD}(\text{val}(w)) $, then $ |w| \leq \text{SD}(\text{val}(w)) $, yet $ w $ must contain syntactic information about "$ \text{SD}(n) $", typically requiring $ |w| \gg \text{SD}(n) $. This is the <strong>incompatibility of descriptive self-reference</strong>.</p>

            <h4>Paradox 2: The Paradox of the Indescribable Number</h4>
            <p>Define a string $ w $ as:</p>
            <blockquote>“$ w $ cannot be described by any string shorter than $ |w| $.”</blockquote>
            <p>But $ w $ itself is a description of length $ |w| $, so it <strong>can be described by itself</strong>. Does this contradict "cannot be described by shorter strings"? The issue lies in: <strong>does "description" include self-description?</strong> If self-description is allowed, $ w $ is a valid description; if self-reference is forbidden, $ w $ has no description—hence a contradiction. This is the <strong>dilemma of the legitimacy of self-referential description</strong>.</p>

            <h4>Paradox 3: Syntactic-Semantic Misalignment</h4>
            <p>Consider $ w = "0" $. Its numerical value is 0, but as a symbol, "0" means "nothing." Yet the string "0" <strong>exists</strong>—it describes the <strong>existence</strong> of "nothing." This forms an <strong>existential self-referential paradox</strong>: a symbol representing "nothing" negates its own meaning by existing.</p>
            <p>Analogous to Gödel numbering, but different: Gödel coding is <strong>meta-language encoding object language</strong>, whereas here we have <strong>object language (digit strings) encoding itself</strong>, a case of <strong>semantic-level self-reference</strong> that more directly touches the philosophical core of "symbols as meaning."</p>

            <h3>3. Philosophical Implications: Do Numbers Possess "Linguistic Capability"?</h3>
            <p>The traditional view holds that integers are abstract objects, and symbols are tools of representation—two distinct categories. But self-referential syntax shows that <strong>integer symbols possess the capacity to "speak about themselves"</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Numerical Self-Awareness?</strong> When "12" is decomposed into "1" and "2", it "knows" it is composed of two digits—a form of <strong>syntactic self-cognition</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Identity of Symbol and Number</strong>: In $ \mathcal{L}_{\mathbb{Z}} $, digit strings are both symbols and syntactic structures. For example, "100" may be interpreted as "10 squared," where "10" is modified by "0," forming recursive syntax.</li>
                <li><strong>Collapse of Objectivity</strong>: If integers can self-reference, their "meaning" depends on <strong>context of description</strong>. The same number may have different self-referential capabilities under different syntactic frameworks (e.g., decimal vs. binary), challenging the <strong>absolute objectivity</strong> of mathematical entities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Furthermore, this suggests: <strong>mathematical language itself may be a "numerical language"</strong>—integers are not only objects, but <strong>generators of syntax</strong>. For instance, primes may be seen as "indecomposable syntactic atoms," while composites are "compound expressions." This provides a concrete model for the idea that <em>"mathematics is language."</em></p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The grammatical self-reference of integers as linguistic symbols reveals their <strong>semantic potential beyond mere numerical value</strong>. By constructing a self-referential syntactic system, we uncover deep contradictions: the shortest description paradox, the indescribable number dilemma, and existential misalignment. These paradoxes not only challenge the consistency of formal systems, but also force us to reconsider: <strong>is the boundary between numbers and symbols as clear as we believe?</strong> Perhaps integers have never been merely "objects to be described," but <strong>active participants in the act of description</strong>. Carrying informational memory in discrete topologies, exhibiting directional dynamics in additive semigroups, and achieving self-reference in linguistic syntax—the domain of integers, with its multidimensional structure, is quietly reshaping our understanding of "mathematical existence."</p>
            <blockquote><strong>The essence of numbers may be precisely that of "self-speaking symbols."</strong></blockquote>
