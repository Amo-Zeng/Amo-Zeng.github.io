            <p>The arrival of the digital age provides fertile ground for social entrepreneurship. The internet breaks down information barriers, making social issues and resources more transparent and lowering the threshold for entrepreneurship, allowing more people to participate in solving social problems. Technologies such as big data, blockchain, and artificial intelligence provide powerful tools for social entrepreneurship, aiding in efficiently identifying issues, designing solutions, and assessing impacts.

            <h3>3. Reshaping Cultural Genes</h3>
            <p>Social entrepreneurship is not only a tool for addressing social issues but also a force reshaping cultural genes. It identifies and corrects "cultural gene flaws" that hinder social development, such as dependency, short-term profit-seeking, and indifference. Social entrepreneurs inject new cultural genes, such as the spirit of struggle, cooperation and win-win, and responsibility, through actions like skills training, green industries, and mutual aid platforms, promoting social progress.</p>

            <h2>Symbiotic Relationships: The Essence of Social Entrepreneurship and Ecosystem Building</h2>
            <p>The essence of social entrepreneurship is symbiosis. Social entrepreneurs and beneficiaries, investors, and other stakeholders coexist and thrive. Social entrepreneurs provide solutions for vulnerable groups and environmental issues through innovative business models, while beneficiaries gain economic and social value through participation. Investors, while supporting social entrepreneurship projects, can also share economic returns and social influence. Multiple entities such as governments, businesses, nonprofits, communities, and academic institutions jointly build a collaborative innovation ecosystem.</p>

Nonprofits should leverage their expertise and resources to provide support and services. Communities should actively participate as practitioners and promoters of social innovation. Academic institutions should conduct research, nurture talent, and provide theoretical support.</p>
