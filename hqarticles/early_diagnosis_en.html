            <h2>Challenges in the Traditional Medical Model</h2>
            <p>In the traditional medical model, patients often only seek help when they exhibit obvious symptoms. However, many diseases, like "silent killers," lurk quietly in the early stages, making them difficult to detect. This delayed healthcare seeking not only causes "silent patients" to miss the best treatment timing but also can lead to severe health and social burdens.</p>

            <h3>Asymptomatic Screening: The Invisible Front Line of Health Protection</h3>
            <p>To turn this situation around, asymptomatic screening emerged as a sharp sword, piercing through the invisibility of diseases. It shifts the medical focus from passive waiting to active intervention, opening up a new path to protect public health.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Discovering Silent Patients, Breaking the Disease Transmission Chain:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A Lesson from COVID-19: The prevalence of nucleic acid testing and health codes has made asymptomatic carriers visible, allowing them to be isolated and treated promptly, effectively breaking the virus transmission chain and protecting countless lives.</li>
                        <li>Hope for Alzheimer's: Through blood tests and cognitive function screening, early-stage patients can be identified before symptoms appear, gaining valuable intervention time to slow disease progression and improve quality of life.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Public Health Levels, Reducing Medical Burden:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Victory in Breast Cancer: Studies show that early screening for breast cancer can reduce mortality by 20-30%. In some countries, under the promotion of government and social forces, early breast cancer screening programs have been widely implemented, effectively improving early diagnosis and cure rates, and alleviating the burden on the medical system.</li>
                        <li>Multi-Pronged Approaches, Building a Healthy Future: The promotion of asymptomatic screening requires concerted efforts from the government, medical institutions, enterprises, and the public. The government can formulate policies, encourage innovation, and provide financial support; medical institutions can strengthen public awareness through publicity; enterprises can develop more convenient and economical screening technologies to benefit more people.</li>
                    </ul>
