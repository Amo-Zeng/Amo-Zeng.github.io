            <h3>From "Symptom Generalization" to "Individual Customization": The Path to Precision in Mental Health Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>For a long time, mental health diagnosis relied on generalized symptom descriptions, such as "anxiety disorder" patients who might experience insomnia, irritability, and inattention. This "one-size-fits-all" approach, while simplifying the diagnosis process, overlooked individual differences, leading to high rates of misdiagnosis and missed diagnoses. However, with the rapid development of big data and artificial intelligence technologies, mental health diagnosis is undergoing a transformation towards precision, moving from "symptom generalization" to "individual customization."</p>
            <h4>Challenging Tradition: Limitations of Symptom Generalization</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ignoring Individual Differences:</strong> Different individuals may experience and exhibit the same symptoms in vastly different ways.</li>
                <li><strong>Lagging Nature:</strong> The appearance of symptoms is often a product of a disease that has progressed to a certain stage, potentially missing the optimal intervention timing.</li>
                <li><strong>Misdiagnosis and Missed Diagnoses:</strong> Generalized symptom descriptions struggle to cover all scenarios, leading to misdiagnosis or missed diagnoses.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Data-Driven: Opening a New Era of Precision Diagnosis</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multi-Dimensional Data Collection:</strong> In addition to traditional symptom questionnaires, data can be collected from individual behavior patterns, physiological indicators, and genetic information.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning Algorithms:</strong> Utilizing machine learning algorithms to analyze and mine massive datasets, identifying potential mental health issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized Diagnostic Models:</strong> Building personalized diagnostic models based on individual data, more accurately assessing mental health status.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Ethical Considerations: Essential Questions on the Path to Precision</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Privacy Leakage:</strong> The large-scale collection and analysis of personal data pose risks of privacy leakage.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Misuse:</strong> Establishing regulations to prevent data misuse.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic Bias:</strong> Algorithms themselves may have biases, requiring continuous optimization to ensure fairness and reliability.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Future Prospects: From "Symptom-Oriented" to "Individual-Oriented"</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personalized Treatment Plans:</strong> Developing personalized treatment plans based on individual mental health status and needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Precision Intervention:</strong> Implementing precise interventions at early stages of disease development to prevent deterioration.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Monitoring and Adjustment:</strong> Utilizing wearable devices to achieve dynamic monitoring of individual mental health status.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Liquid Biopsy: A Revolutionary Technology Disrupting Traditional Cancer Screening Models</h3>
            <p>Liquid biopsy is a technology that analyzes blood and other body fluids to detect and evaluate disease status. Its core lies in capturing and analyzing biomarkers related to tumors in the circulatory system, including circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cell-free DNA (cfDNA), and exosomes.</p>
            <h4>Core and Advantages of Liquid Biopsy</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minimally Invasive:</strong> Significantly reduces patient pain and complication risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Ease of Repeated Sampling:</strong> Naturally advantageous for disease monitoring and efficacy evaluation.</li>
                <li><strong>Wide Applicability:</strong> For patients where traditional methods cannot easily obtain tumor tissue, liquid biopsy opens a new diagnostic pathway.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Clinical Applications and Challenges of Liquid Biopsy</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improving Detection Sensitivity:</strong> Further enhancing detection sensitivity to capture signals from small tumors.</li>
                <li><strong>Reducing Detection Costs:</strong> Reducing costs to enable large-scale application.</li>
                <li><strong>Standardizing Detection Processes:</strong> Standardizing processes to ensure reliable and reproducible results.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Future Prospects: Broad Horizon for Liquid Biopsy</h4>
            <p>With continuous technological breakthroughs and cost reductions, liquid biopsy is expected to become a routine method for cancer screening. Leveraging AI and big data analysis, the interpretative capabilities of liquid biopsy will be further enhanced, achieving more precise tumor profiling.</p>

            <h3>From "Reactive Treatment" to "Active Prevention": Early Diagnosis Reconstructing Chronic Disease Management Models</h3>
            <p>Chronic diseases, like silent killers, are stealthily eroding the health of millions worldwide. Traditional chronic disease management models, emphasizing "reactive treatment," often result in patients seeking medical attention only after symptoms become evident, missing optimal intervention opportunities, leading to aggravated conditions, increased medical costs, and decreased quality of life.</p>
            <h4>Reflecting on the Status Quo: The Predicament of "Reactive Treatment"</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aggravation of Conditions:</strong> Early symptoms of chronic diseases are often subtle, easily overlooked, leading to gradual worsening.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Medical Costs:</strong> Treatment of chronic diseases in advanced stages becomes more challenging, driving up medical expenses.</li>
                <li><strong>Decreased Quality of Life:</strong> Chronic diseases not only affect physical health but also lead to emotional distress and social impairment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Early Diagnosis: The Key to "Active Prevention"</h4>
            <p>Early diagnosis refers to identifying early signs or risk factors of a disease before obvious symptoms appear, through various examination methods, enabling early intervention and control.</p>
            <h4>Model Reconstruction: From "Disease-Centered" to "Health-Centered"</h4>
            <p>A chronic disease management model centered on early diagnosis will fundamentally change traditional "reactive treatment" into "active prevention."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early Detection:</strong> Establishing a robust health check-up system, encouraging regular health examinations.</li>
                <li><strong>Early Intervention:</strong> Implementing early interventions for high-risk populations, such as lifestyle modifications and medication.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Management:</strong> Developing comprehensive chronic disease management systems, providing personalized health management services.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion: The Future Landscape of Early Diagnosis Technology</h3>
            <p>From "symptom generalization" to "individual customization" in mental health, from "liquid biopsy" in cancer screening to "active prevention" in chronic disease management, early diagnosis technology is profoundly reshaping the face of medicine. These technological breakthroughs not only enhance the precision and personalization of diagnoses but also provide new tools and perspectives for early disease detection and intervention.</p>
