            <h2>Combining Personalized Learning Paths with Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p>The core of personalized learning paths is to respect and utilize the individual differences of students. Each student has unique talents, interests, and learning paces; traditional "one-size-fits-all" educational models often fail to meet these diverse needs. The introduction of AI technology makes this concept feasible.</p>

            <h3>Challenges and Prospects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Privacy and Security Issues:</strong> Educational institutions need to ensure the proper protection of vast amounts of student data to safeguard student privacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Role Transition for Teachers:</strong> Teachers must shift from being traditional knowledge imparters to facilitators and mentors in learning.</li>

            <h2>Integration of Interdisciplinary Approaches and Real-World Problems</h2>
            <p>Modern societal issues are complex and multifaceted; a single-discipline perspective often does not suffice for comprehensive solutions. Interdisciplinary education integrates knowledge and methods from various fields to foster students' abilities in comprehensive analysis and problem-solving.</p>
