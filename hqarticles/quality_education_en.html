            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technology, akin to a silent revolution, is profoundly reshaping every corner of modern society. As native participants in this revolution, teenagers—commonly referred to as "Digital Natives"—are born into a world enveloped by digital waves. They are inherently capable of navigating smart devices and effortlessly moving between social media, online learning platforms, and various digital tools. However, the complexity and depth of the digital world go far beyond what meets the eye, and mere mastery of technical skills is insufficient for them to thrive in this era, let alone become true "Digital Citizens."</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, traditional educational models are increasingly showing their limitations in addressing the complex demands of future society. Within the framework of standardized education, students' personalized needs and problem-solving abilities are often overlooked, reducing the essence of education to a tool for knowledge transfer rather than a platform for unleashing potential and fostering innovation. Facing this challenge, education must shift from a paradigm of "knowledge acquisition" to "problem-solving," and from "standardization" to "personalization," to cultivate the key competencies students will need in future society, helping them become active and responsible "Digital Citizens."</p>

            <h2>1. The Natural Advantages and Hidden Dangers of "Digital Natives"</h2>
            <p>The "Digital Native" generation grows up in a digital environment, where their lives and learning are already inextricably linked with digital technology. This generation possesses the ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and skillfully navigate digital tools. Their ease in information acquisition and dissemination highlights the distinctive characteristics of the digital age. However, this "digital native" environment also brings considerable hidden dangers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decline in Deep Thinking and Concentration:</strong> Overemphasis on digital devices may lead to a decline in deep thinking and concentration, as teenagers tend to skim rather than delve into topics.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Information Discrimination Skills:</strong> In the context of information explosion, the absence of critical thinking and information discrimination skills makes teenagers vulnerable to misinformation, internet rumors, and inappropriate content.</li>
                <li><strong>Weak Cybersecurity Awareness:</strong> The anonymity and virtual nature of the digital world may cause students to overlook social responsibility and ethical norms in online behavior, leading to a series of social issues.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. From "Standardization" to "Personalization": Reflection and Return in Education</h2>
            <p>The impact of the industrial revolution once caused the traditional "individually tailored education" philosophy to fade in the tide of standardized education. The standardized education model seeks efficiency and scale effects, treating students as "products" that can be mass-produced, ignoring the unique interests, hobbies, talents, and learning styles of each individual.</p>
            <p>Personalized education emphasizes respect for individual differences, providing each student with an educational path suited to their development through individualized teaching methods. Building a diversified evaluation system, providing personalized learning guidance, and creating an inclusive educational environment are key to achieving personalized education. Through such measures, education can better meet students' personalized needs, unleash their creativity and potential, and help them stand out in future competition.</p>

            <h2>3. From "Knowledge Acquisition" to "Problem-Solving": Cultivating Key Skills for the Future</h2>
            <p>In an era of information explosion, the acquisition of knowledge has become more convenient than ever, yet the life cycle of knowledge is continually shortening. Relying solely on the memorization and accumulation of knowledge is no longer sufficient to help students cope with future complex challenges. Therefore, the focus of education must shift from knowledge transmission to problem-solving, cultivating students' ability to flexibly apply knowledge to address practical issues.</p>
            <p>Project-Based Learning (PBL), as an educational model driven by problems, can effectively stimulate students' initiative and creativity. The rise of interdisciplinary integrated teaching and maker education provides new paths for cultivating students' problem-solving skills. By breaking down subject boundaries, students can understand the essence of problems from multiple perspectives and propose multi-layered solutions.</p>

            <h2>4. The Integration of Digital Literacy and Personalized Education: The Key to Cultivating "Digital Citizens"</h2>
            <p>Within the framework of holistic education, the cultivation of digital literacy should become an integral part of students' comprehensive development. Digital literacy includes not only the mastery of technical skills but also the development of information discrimination skills, critical thinking, cybersecurity awareness, social responsibility, and ethical norms.</p>
            <p>The integration of personalized education and digital literacy cultivation provides students with a richer, more diverse, and more open learning space. Through personalized learning guidance, students can find their own learning methods and paths; through the cultivation of digital literacy, students can better adapt to future challenges in the digital world, becoming well-rounded "Digital Citizens."</p>

            <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>From "Digital Natives" to "Digital Citizens" is not just about enhancing technical skills but also about the comprehensive development of digital literacy. Within the context of holistic education, leveraging technology to empower digital literacy education can help teenagers better adapt to the demands of the digital age, becoming "Digital Citizens" with critical thinking, social responsibility, and ethical norms.</p>
            <p>Only through collaboration and the joint promotion of personalized education and the in-depth development of digital literacy education can we enable teenagers to grow healthily in the digital world and become active contributors to future society. This is not only the mission of education but also our beautiful vision for future society.</p>
