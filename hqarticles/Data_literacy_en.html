            <h2>Data Literacy: The Core Force Shaping a Sustainable Future</h2>
            <p>In today's digital and data-driven era, data literacy has become not only a key tool for individuals to understand and manage their own health but also a core driver in achieving global sustainable development goals (SDGs). Data literacy, the ability to acquire, analyze, and apply data, plays a crucial role in various fields including artificial intelligence ethics, mental health management, and sustainable development. This article will delve into the applications of data literacy in these areas and demonstrate how it promotes comprehensive progress for individuals and society.</p>

            <h3>Data Literacy and Artificial Intelligence Ethics</h3>
            <p>The intersection of data literacy and artificial intelligence ethics lies in their shared focus on the ethical and moral issues in data usage, analysis, and decision-making processes. Data literacy involves not only the cultivation of technical skills but also emphasizes its foundational role in ethical and moral judgment. By enhancing data literacy, the public can better understand the biases, transparency, and accountability of AI algorithms, making more rational and responsible judgments when facing decisions related to artificial intelligence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Understanding Algorithmic Bias:</strong> Data literacy enables the public to recognize biases that may exist in the selection and processing of training data for algorithms, thereby increasing awareness of their potential harm.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Transparency:</strong> Data literacy allows the public to interpret and evaluate how AI models work, understanding the internal decision logic and the impact of parameter adjustments on results.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening Accountability:</strong> Data literacy enables the public to track the decision-making processes of AI systems, monitor their behavior, and assess the reasonableness of their outcomes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Literacy and Mental Health Management</h3>
            <p>In the field of mental health, data literacy also plays an indispensable role. The combination of smartphone applications, mental health statistics, and data visualization tools allows individuals to manage and understand their mental health data more effectively, thereby enhancing self-awareness, scientific decision-making, and data control.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Emotional Fluctuation Recording:</strong> Smartphone applications can record users' emotional fluctuations, sleep quality, activity levels, and other multi-dimensional data, helping users to concretize abstract feelings.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Analysis and Insights:</strong> Data analysis and insight capabilities enable users to identify patterns in emotional changes, discover potential stressors or behavioral patterns, and make targeted adjustments to their lifestyle.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Visualization Tools:</strong> Data visualization tools transform complex mental health data into intuitive charts or images, helping users to better understand their data.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Data Literacy and Sustainable Development Goals</h3>
            <p>In the context of global sustainable development, data literacy is a key force in driving the achievement of sustainable development goals. Complex challenges such as climate change, natural resource management, and social inequality require data-driven insights to address, and data literacy provides effective tools for individuals, communities, and the global community.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate Change Domain:</strong> Individuals with data literacy can interpret complex climate change data, understand scientific consensus, participate in policy-making, and take personal actions to reduce carbon emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Level:</strong> Data literacy enables communities to identify key challenges and formulate effective solutions, such as identifying the root causes of issues like poverty, education, and health resource allocation.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Government Decision-making:</strong> Data-driven insights provide local governments with scientific foundations for decision-making, thereby promoting the achievement of sustainable development goals at the local level.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Data literacy in the era of globalization, informatization, and data-driven decision-making is not only a key tool for individuals to enhance their quality of life and health management capabilities but also a core force in promoting ethical development of artificial intelligence technology and achieving sustainable development goals. By improving data literacy, the public can develop stronger critical thinking and responsible technology usage awareness in complex technical decisions and ethical challenges. The popularization and application of data literacy will build a more transparent, fair, and sustainable future, ensuring that technological progress truly benefits all of humanity.</p>
