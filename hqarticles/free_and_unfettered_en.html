            <h3>Interpreting the Efficacy Mechanism of Xiaoyao Powder from the Perspective of "Emotional Granularity"</h3>
            <p>Emotional granularity refers to the degree of detail and differentiation ability of an individual's emotional experiences. People with high emotional granularity can recognize and describe their emotions more clearly, thus more effectively regulating their emotions. Conversely, people with low emotional granularity often struggle to accurately express their emotions, easily falling into emotional distress.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Emotional Perception</strong>: Herbs like Bupleurum and White Peony in Xiaoyao Powder have the effect of soothing the liver and regulating qi, helping patients to perceive and recognize their emotions more clearly. This enhanced emotional perception allows patients to describe their emotional states more accurately, thereby better regulating their emotions.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting Emotional Expression</strong>: By harmonizing qi and blood, relieving liver stagnation, Xiaoyao Powder enables patients to express their emotions more freely. This freedom of emotional expression helps patients release inner pressure and reduce the accumulation of negative emotions.</li>
                <li><strong>Improving Emotional Regulation</strong>: Long-term use of Xiaoyao Powder can help patients establish a healthier emotional regulation mechanism. By enhancing emotional granularity, patients can more effectively cope with life's pressures and challenges, achieving a state of "Xiaoyao" (carefree).</li>
