#### **Data Privacy Challenges in AI-Driven Conflict Mediation**

```html
<section>
  <h2>Data Privacy: A Core Issue in AI-Enabled Conflict Resolution</h2>
  <p>When AI is applied to scenarios such as dispute resolution in multinational corporations or political negotiation simulations, it involves the handling of sensitive data (e.g., communication records, user behavior trajectories). The following risks must be carefully addressed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Risk of Sensitive Data Leakage</strong>: Conflict mediation involves multiple stakeholders, and datasets might include confidential agreements or personal identity information.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk of Re-identification</strong>: Mediation strategies generated through voice and text analysis could be used to re-identify individuals when combined with other data sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Abuse of Multimodal Data</strong>: Technologies like facial expression recognition and sentiment analysis, if misused by third parties, could potentially escalate conflicts.</li>
  </ul>

#### **Privacy-Preserving Technical Solutions**

```html
<section>
  <h3>Technical Strategies: Protecting Data in AI-Based Conflict Mediation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Differential Privacy</strong>  
      Introduce random noise during the training of sentiment analysis models to ensure that predictions cannot be linked to specific users. An example is Google's federated learning framework.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Federated Learning</strong>  
      Decentralized data processing model: For example, in an international mediation system, model training occurs locally in each country, meaning the original dialogue content is not uploaded.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Multiparty Computation (MPC)</strong>  
      Use verifiable encryption techniques in real-time voice recognition modules of mediation AI to ensure data remains confidential during collaboration among multiple parties.</li>
  </ol>

#### **Policies and Cases: GDPR and AI Conflict Mediation Framework**

```html
<section>
  <h3>Policy Alignment: GDPR and AI Conflict Mediation</h3>
  <p>Under Article 35 of GDPR, AI applications involving "special-category data" (e.g., race, religion) must undergo Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs). The following application scenarios provide compliance solutions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Middle East Economic Mediation Case</strong>: When training an AI negotiation assistant with federated learning, ensure that data from both Israeli and Palestinian parties is not directly shared, only model parameters are uploaded.</li>
    <li><strong>Voice Analysis in Corporate M&A Disputes</strong>: Use multiparty computation to process voice data during negotiations, thereby protecting sensitive business information from leaks.</li>
  </ul>

#### **Ethical Considerations: Balancing Privacy and Efficiency**

```html
<section>
  <h3>Ethical Dilemmas and Solutions</h3>
  <p>Privacy-preserving technologies in conflict mediation may raise the following challenges:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sparsity in Data</strong>: The noise added through differential privacy may reduce the accuracy of sentiment analysis, leading to distorted mediation strategies.</li>
    <li><strong>Trust-building Challenges</strong>: Some stakeholders may refuse federated learning solutions due to skepticism regarding the authenticity and effectiveness of locally trained data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Recommended Strategy</strong>: Implement a dynamic privacy budget mechanism (e.g., adaptive adjustment of Îµ) to balance privacy and model performance at different stages of mediation.</p>
