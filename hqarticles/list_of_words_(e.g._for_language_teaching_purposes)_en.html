            <h2>Introduction: The Eternal Light of Vocabulary</h2>
            <p>The river of human civilization flows endlessly, while vocabulary is the eternal beacon in this river. Each word is like a tiny light source, converging into a sea, illuminating the deep tunnel of human cognition and witnessing every important moment of civilization evolution.</p>

            <h3>I. Vocabulary: The Eternal Beacon of Cognitive World</h3>
            <p><strong>1. The Birth of Vocabulary: A Miracle of Human Civilization</strong></p>
            <p>The birth of vocabulary itself is a great miracle of human civilization. When our ancestors first used the word "fire" to refer to the substance that brought light and warmth, humanity began the grand endeavor of constructing the world with vocabulary.</p>
            <p><strong>2. The Evolution of Vocabulary: Reflection and Accumulation of Civilization</strong></p>
            <p>In this river of civilization, vocabulary not only carries the deepest wisdom of humanity but also reflects the leap of civilization through continuous evolution. For example, the birth of the character "Dao" in Oracle Bone Script reflects ancient people's thoughts on the laws of the universe.</p>

            <h3>II. Artificial Intelligence: A New Battlefield and Cognitive Revolution</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Redefinition of Vocabulary: The Cognitive Starting Point of AI</strong></p>
            <p>With the rise of artificial intelligence, the meaning and role of vocabulary are being redefined. The ultimate goal of artificial intelligence is to fully simulate human thinking, and this simulation begins with the understanding and use of vocabulary.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Dynamic Semantics: Challenges and Opportunities of AI</strong></p>
            <p>In the world of artificial intelligence, the meaning of vocabulary is not fixed but constantly changing. For instance, the word "apple" evolves in different contexts such as food, technology, and culture.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Two-Way Interaction: Regulation and Innovation in the Language Revolution</strong></p>
            <p>In this silent language revolution, there is always subtle two-way interaction between AI systems and human users. Each new vocabulary input is a challenge and training for the system.</p>

            <h3>III. Virtual and Reality: Dual Dimensions of Vocabulary and Future Prospects</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Vocabulary Innovation in Virtual World: Blending of Reality and Imagination</strong></p>
            <p>In the intertwining of virtual and reality, vocabulary exhibits a unique dual nature. The explosive development of internet slang showcases the infinite possibilities of vocabulary creation.</p>
            <p><strong>2. The Future of Vocabulary: Deep Integration of Virtual and Reality</strong></p>
            <p>The future of language will inevitably be the product of deep integration of virtual and reality. Under the impetus of new technologies, the vocabulary system will become more open and inclusive.</p>
