            <p>At the heart of digital civilization, datasets are quietly depositing themselves as a new kind of geological stratum. Much like rock layers record climatic shifts, the versioning, corpus composition, and annotation rules of datasets stack up over time, layer by layer, tracing the evolution of human cognition. This is not merely "data archiving"—it is an unconscious, large-scale civilizational burial. Every data cleaning, labeling bias, and sampling preference acts as a "depositional event" in geological terms.</p>

            <h3>Shifting "Semantic Strata" in Chinese Internet Corpora</h3>
            <p>Take Chinese internet corpora as an example: datasets from early 2000s BBS forums were filled with internet slang like "bānzhú" (webmaster) and "guànshuǐ" (flooding), reflecting a decentralized, playful semantic network. In contrast, 2020s short video comment datasets are highly emotional, with keywords like "pòfáng" (emotional breakdown) and "tāfáng" (celebrity scandal fallout) forming new semantic strata. This shift from "constructive expression" to "emotional reaction" mirrors the geological transition from coarse conglomerates to fine mudstones—indicating a collective psychological sedimentation from participatory culture to reactive resonance.</p>

            <h3>The "Fossil" Value of Image Datasets</h3>
            <p>The evolution of image datasets carries even greater "fossil" significance. In early ImageNet, occupational labels such as "bride" and "nurse" were almost exclusively female, while "programmer" and "engineer" were default male—a labeling stratum exposing gender stereotypes in 2010s societal cognition. Although newer datasets attempt balanced sampling, the "depositional layers" of older datasets continue to release biases during training, much like ancient fossils releasing methane and altering the modern climate. More critically, deleted "sensitive images" form "negative strata"—their absence itself creates fault lines in civilizational memory.</p>

            <h3>Data Archaeology: From Data Distribution to Civilizational Memory</h3>
            <p>This "digital stratigraphy" has given rise to a new paradigm: **data archaeology**. While traditional AI research focuses on "current data distributions," data archaeologists ask: Why were certain semantics buried? Which groups vanished during deposition? For instance, analyzing the shifting co-occurrence network of the term "immigrant" in Twitter corpora reveals that before and after the 2015 refugee crisis, the word's associations shifted from "humanitarian aid" to "security risk." This semantic "lithofacies change" records the sedimentation of collective anxiety more authentically than any social survey could.</p>

            <h3>Algorithmic Power and "Selective Lithification"</h3>
            <p>The deposition of datasets is not a natural process, but a tectonic movement shaped by algorithmic power and capital logic. When companies choose to retain "high-engagement data" while deleting content from "low-activity users," they are effectively selecting which layers of civilization to preserve. We now face a crisis of **selective lithification**: only data that has been "petrified" by algorithms survives; the rest, like loose sediments, is eroded away.</p>

            <h3>Establishing "Data Strata Archives": Memory Fossils of Civilization</h3>
            <p>Therefore, datasets should not merely serve as training material—they must be recognized as **memory fossils** of technological civilization. Every round of data cleaning strips away a layer of civilizational memory; every version iteration uplifts a stratum of cognition. We urgently need to establish **data strata archives**, applying geological rigor to digital deposition, so that collective memories buried by algorithms can be unearthed through the trowels of data archaeology and brought back into the light of day.</p>
