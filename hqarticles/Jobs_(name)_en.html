            <h2>Steve Jobs' Legacy: Reconstructing Modern Values</h2>
            <p>Steve Jobs not only changed the world with revolutionary tech products but also redefined modern human value paradigms with his outstanding thought system. His "Reality Distortion Field," "Think Different" design thinking, and "Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish" life attitude collectively formed a complete thought system, helping us find our footing in the modern society with information explosion and rapid technological development.</p>

            <h3>1. Reshaping Cognitive Boundaries: Psychology Analysis of "Reality Distortion Field"</h3>
            <p>Jobs' "Reality Distortion Field" is not merely a psychological technique but a profound ability to restructure cognition. He could keenly capture the intersection of technological trends and human needs, transforming this insight into a disruptive business vision. The key to this ability lies in not just seeing the surface of things but understanding the underlying human essence.</p>
            <p>Through continuous psychological suggestion mechanisms, Jobs locked the team's goals onto seemingly impossible visions. His "We must do it" was not blind optimism but a deep understanding of markets, technology, and human nature. This seemingly irrational persistence was actually a perfect blend of rationality and insight. Applying this field in contemporary workplace can cultivate the ability to both understand the essence and reshape reality. In rapidly changing environments, this leadership can help organizations find certainty in uncertainty and create the possible from the impossible.</p>

            <h3>2. Design Thinking: Deep Integration of Technology and Humanities</h3>
            <p>"Think Different" was not just Apple's slogan but also a tool for Jobs to deconstruct traditional thinking patterns. By blending art, technology, and humanities, he pioneered a human-centered design thinking model. This approach broke down disciplinary boundaries, establishing a new paradigm of innovation.</p>
            <p>Jobs' design thinking fundamentally decoded human emotional codes. From the minimalist design of the iPod to the touch revolution of the iPhone, each product was a profound response to human needs. The value of this thinking method lies not only in creating world-changing products but also in establishing a sustainable innovation mechanism. In contemporary society, design thinking has become a universal language for cross-border innovation. Whether in business or social innovation, this thinking method demonstrates powerful vitality, reminding us that true innovation is not merely the accumulation of technology but a deep understanding and response to human nature.</p>

            <h3>3. Breaking Through Spiritual Dilemmas: The Wisdom of "Hunger" and "Foolishness"</h3>
            <p>In his Stanford speech, Jobs summarized his life attitude with "Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish." This attitude was not just about pursuing success but a profound reflection on self-awareness. In the era of information explosion, staying "hungry" means continuous learning and self-renewal, while "foolishness" is a reflection on excessive rationality.</p>
            <p>Jobs' life was full of cycles of failure and success, yet he always maintained reverence for the unknown and passion for exploration. This breaking through of spiritual dilemmas not only brought him personal success but also provided modern people with wisdom to deal with the complex world. In today's rapidly developing technology, we need this wisdom of maintaining "hunger" and "foolishness" to face future challenges.</p>
