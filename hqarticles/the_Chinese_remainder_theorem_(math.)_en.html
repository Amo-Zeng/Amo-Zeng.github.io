            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), originating from the ancient Chinese mathematician Sun Tzu (around the 4th century AD) in the "Sun Tzu Suan Jing," stands as a jewel in number theory. CRT showcases its profound influence in modern technology, from cryptography to blockchain technology, and even in applications in artificial intelligence. This article will explore specific applications of CRT in these fields, revealing its role in new technological contexts, and analyzing the challenges it faces and its future development directions.</p>

            <h3>Basic Principles of the Chinese Remainder Theorem</h3>
            <p>The Chinese Remainder Theorem addresses a class of problems related to systems of congruences: given several coprime integers as moduli \(m_1, m_2, ..., m_n\) and corresponding remainders \(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\), there exists an integer \(x\) such that:</p>
            <p>\[ x \equiv a_i \pmod{m_i} \]</p>
            <p>for all \(i = 1, 2, ..., n\). Under the modulus \(M = m_1 \times m_2 \times ... \times m_n\), \(x\) is unique.</p>
