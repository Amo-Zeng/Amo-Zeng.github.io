                <li><strong>Virtual Stage Design:</strong> In the revival of "Othello," designers used 3D modeling and projection technology to create a dynamic stage background.</li>
                <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> Some theaters are beginning to use AI to optimize script writing and performance analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Mixed Reality (MR):</strong> In a modern adaptation of "A Midsummer Night's Dream," audiences wearing MR glasses can see both the live actors on stage and virtual elements integrated with the stage environment.</li>
