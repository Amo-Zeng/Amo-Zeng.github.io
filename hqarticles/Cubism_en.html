            <h2>Application of Frege's "Context Principle" in Visual Semiotic Systems</h2>
            <p>Cubism's revolutionary nature lies not only in formal fragmentation but also in its <strong>structural reconstruction of visual semiotic systems</strong>. While traditional art sought to establish stable correspondences between symbols and objects through realistic imitation, Cubism reveals a more fundamental proposition by deconstructing the coherence of forms: <strong>the meaning of visual symbols does not inherently reside in individual elements but emerges through dynamic structural networks</strong>.</p>

            <h3>I. Frege's Philosophical Revolution: Primacy of Context and Generative Meaning</h3>
            <h4>1.1 The Collapse of Traditional Semantics</h4>
            <p>In 1884, Frege proposed the groundbreaking "Context Principle" in <em>The Foundations of Arithmetic</em>: "A word has meaning only in the context of a sentence." For Frege, any isolated name (e.g., "cat") remains a potential symbol whose true meaning activates only within specific propositional structures. This meaning-generation mechanism shows that <strong>a symbol's essential function lies not in "referring to an object" but in "performing a role within a system"</strong>.</p>

            <h4>1.2 "Use" Transcending "Reference"</h4>
            <p>Wittgenstein deepened this approach in <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, proposing "meaning as use." This conceptual shift finds mirroring in Cubist collage: when Picasso pasted cane patterns directly onto canvas, his intention was not to depict an actual chair but to use the material as a tool for constructing spatial relationships.</p>

            <h3>II. Goodman's Stratified Symbol Theory: Reconstructing Cubism's Non-Referential Debate</h3>
            <h4>2.1 Self-Referential vs. Hetero-Referential Signifiers</h4>
            <p>Nelson Goodman distinguishes between "hetero-reference" and "self-reference" in art semiotic systems in <em>Languages of Art</em>. Juan Gris's <em>Breakfast</em> (1914) exemplifies this tension: the coffee pot in the painting is neither fully abstract color blocks nor direct representation of reality.</p>

            <h4>2.2 The Translation Dilemma of Label Systems</h4>
            <p>Goodman further notes that all symbolic systems require labels to connect with referents. Cubism's innovation lies in dissolving univocal labels: a single symbol may simultaneously perform multiple labeling functions – form reference, spatial positioning, and rhythmic control.</p>

            <h3>III. Visual Syntactic Analysis of <em>Breakfast</em>: Strategies of Semiotic Network Reconstruction</h3>
            <h4>3.1 Topological Transformation of Perspective System</h4>
            <p><em>Breakfast</em> achieves topological deformation of traditional perspective through <strong>multi-perspective superimposition</strong>. This operation parallels Frege's "function-variable" concept – the meaning of fragmented forms shifts according to their positions.</p>

            <h4>3.2 Structuralization of Color Coding</h4>
            <p>Warm tones create dynamic forward movement while cool tones form a static base. Each color's value depends on its relative position in the chromatic network – perfectly aligning with Frege's view that "a symbol's semantic value is determined by its systemic coordinates."</p>

            <h3>V. Philosophical Debate: Is Cubism a Visual Prelude to the "Linguistic Turn"?</h3>
            <h4>5.1 Radical Propositions</h4>
            <p>Proponents argue that Cubism completed art's "Copernican Revolution": every symbol in <em>Breakfast</em> functions like a "syntagm" in language systems, its value entirely defined by differential relations between signs.</p>

            <h4>5.2 Conservative Counterarguments</h4>
            <p>Critics note Cubism never completely abandoned reality: fragmented forms still suggest three-dimensional existence, the semiotic system retaining traces of the original world.</p>
