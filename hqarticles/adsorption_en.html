            <h2>Intelligent Adsorption: A Cross-Dimensional Cognitive Revolution from Earth to Space</h2>
            <p>Adsorption, as the underlying mechanism of material interactions, is undergoing a paradigm shift from classical thermodynamics to dynamic intelligent systems. Modern adsorption science has transcended the limitations of traditional equilibrium studies, demonstrating universal value from the molecular to the interstellar scale through the integration of materials engineering, astrophysics, neuroscience, and other interdisciplinary perspectives. This article constructs a three-dimensional analytical framework of "intelligent adsorption, space adsorption, and cognitive adsorption," revealing the disruptive potential of this fundamental physical process in cutting-edge areas of human civilization.</p>

            <h3>I. Intelligent Adsorption Materials: Paradigm Breakthroughs in Environmentally Responsive Systems</h3>
            <h4>(1) Revolution in Energy and Mass Transfer from Static to Dynamic</h4>
            <p>Traditional adsorption materials are limited by fixed pore structures and surface chemical properties, while intelligent adsorption systems enable real-time programming of adsorption kinetics by incorporating stimuli-responsive units (e.g., azobenzene groups, temperature-sensitive polymers). For example, photo-controlled metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit dynamic pore size adjustment between 0.5–2.1 nm through ligand photoisomerization, with adsorption capacity fluctuations of up to 300%, far exceeding predictions of the classical Langmuir model.</p>
            <h4>(2) Engineering of Closed-Loop Control Systems</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Medical Diagnostics:</strong> MIT's graphene-hydrogel composite membrane achieves on-demand glucose adsorption energy release through surface plasmon resonance, enhancing detection sensitivity to 10^-15 mol/L, six orders of magnitude higher than traditional enzyme electrodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Remediation:</strong> The University of Tokyo developed pH-gated COF materials, where sulfonic acid group dissociation reversibly adjusts with pH changes, achieving dynamic Pb2+ adsorption capacity of 1200 mg/g and cycle stability exceeding 500 cycles.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>(3) Deep Mechanisms of Material Intelligence</h4>
            <p>Recent studies show that machine learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations (e.g., SchNet algorithms) can accurately predict the structure-activity relationship of stimuli-responsive adsorbents, marking a new computational-driven era of adsorption research in "design-prediction-validation."</p>

            <h3>II. The Paradox of Space Adsorption: Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics in Extreme Environments</h3>
            <h4>(1) Unique Phase Diagrams of Extraterrestrial Adsorption</h4>
            <p>Extreme conditions such as the Moon's 300°C day-night temperature difference and Mars' atmospheric pressure of 0.6 kPa result in anomalous adsorption characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Helium-3 adsorption activation energy in lunar soil decreased by 42% (Apollo 17 sample data).</li>
                <li>BET surface area of Martian hematite for water vapor is only 23% of Earth-simulated values (Perseverance rover data).</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>(2) Breakthroughs in Interstellar Resource Development</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Low-Gravity Adsorption Enhancement:</strong> JAXA's electrostatic confinement array, with a 10^4 V/m electric field, achieves 98% lunar dust particle capture efficiency (under 1/6g conditions).</li>
                <li><strong>Temperature-Adaptive Materials:</strong> NASA's phase-change composite adsorbent maintains stable performance between -100°C to 150°C, validated in the Mars 2020 mission.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>(3) New Paradigms for Planetary Protection</h4>
            <p>ESA's gradient-wettability coating, by regulating surface contact angle hysteresis (adjustable between 30°–150°), effectively prevents irreversible Martian dust adhesion on solar panels.</p>
