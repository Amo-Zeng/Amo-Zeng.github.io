            <h2>The New Role of the WTO in the Digital Era: Reshaping Global Value Chains and Trade Rules</h2>
            <p>Under the dual impetus of globalization and digitalization, the World Trade Organization (WTO) is at a historic turning point. The rapid development of digital trade is profoundly rewriting traditional global value chains and posing unprecedented challenges to the WTO's existing trade rules. In this context, the WTO must actively respond, not only to lead the formulation of digital trade rules but also to play a more active role in the reconstruction of global value chains. As an important member of the WTO and a representative of developing countries, China is not only a staunch defender of multilateralism in this process but also a significant force for development.</p>

            <h3>The Rise of Digital Trade and the Challenges to WTO Rules</h3>
            <p>The rapid development of digital trade is disrupting traditional trade frameworks, with issues such as data localization requirements, digital service taxes, and cross-border data flows becoming the litmus tests for the WTO's current rules. Data localization requirements may restrict cross-border data flows, impeding the development of digital trade; digital service taxes challenge traditional tax systems, potentially leading to double taxation or tax loopholes; cross-border data flow issues involve differences in countries' understanding of data sovereignty, which may result in data flow barriers. These challenges not only test the adaptability and flexibility of WTO rules but also require the WTO to balance the freedom of data flow with the needs for data security and privacy protection when formulating new digital trade rules.</p>

            <h3>China's Role in WTO Reform: Perspectives from Multilateralism and Developing Countries</h3>
            <p>In the context of rising global trade protectionism and rampant unilateralism, China firmly supports the multilateral trade system, emphasizing the core role of the WTO in global economic governance. As an important member of the WTO, China has played a significant role in pushing for reforms in the WTO appellate body, development issue negotiations, and the formulation of digital trade rules.</p>
            <p>In the process of promoting the reform of the WTO appellate body, China actively participated in negotiations, advocating for constructive dialogue and cooperation to restore the normal operation of the appellate body. China's proposed reform plan emphasizes common interests among member countries, opposing any country putting its own interests at the center to the detriment of other members' rights. This multilateralist stance helps bridge differences among parties and drive the reform process forward.</p>
            <p>From the perspective of developing countries, China's role in the WTO is not only as a defender of multilateralism but also as a promoter of development issues. China actively advocates for the interests of developing countries, pushing for WTO reforms towards a more equitable and inclusive direction. In development issue negotiations, China advocates for the inclusion of special and differential treatment (SDT) for developing countries as a core element of reform, supports extending market access preferences for the least developed countries, and promotes WTO member countries to provide more flexibility and preferential treatment for developing countries in areas such as intellectual property and services trade.</p>

            <h3>Global Value Chain Reconstruction and the WTO's New Mission</h3>
            <p>The reconstruction of global value chains is profoundly changing the global economic operation model. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the tense geopolitical situation, and the multi-layered effects of technological advances are accelerating the evolution of global value chain reconstruction. In this process, the WTO faces numerous challenges; traditional international trade rules are no longer adaptable to the new forms of value chains. The proportion of service trade in global value chains continues to rise, but the WTO's service trade rules remain at the level of the 1990s, unable to meet the new demands of the digital era. Investment facilitation has become an important driving force in the reconstruction of global value chains, but the WTO's investment rule system has not yet formed a unified international standard, with significant differences in investment facilitation practices among countries. The participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in global value chains needs to be enhanced, but existing trade and investment rules often overlook the special needs of SMEs, leading to their marginalization in global value chains.</p>
            <p>To address these challenges, the WTO needs to adopt a multifaceted strategy to promote more inclusive and sustainable development of global value chains. Firstly, the WTO should accelerate the modernization of service trade rules, especially in digital service trade, by formulating unified international standards to adapt to the digital trends of global value chains. Secondly, the WTO should promote the coordination and unification of investment facilitation rules, facilitating the liberalization and facilitation of cross-border investments, and providing stable institutional guarantees for the reconstruction of global value chains. Additionally, the WTO should address the participation of SMEs in global value chains by formulating targeted trade and investment policies to lower market entry barriers for SMEs and enhance their competitiveness in global value chains.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Under the dual drive of globalization and digitalization, the WTO is at a historic turning point. The rise of digital trade not only reshapes traditional global value chains but also poses new challenges to the WTO's existing trade rules. In this context, the WTO needs to keep pace with the times, not only playing a leading role in the formulation of digital trade rules but also taking on a more active role in the reconstruction of global value chains. China, as an important member of the WTO and a representative of developing countries, plays a key role in this process as a defender of multilateralism and a promoter of development issues. Through a multilateralist stance, promotion of development issues, and leadership in digital trade rule formulation, China has played a significant constructive role in the WTO reform. In the future, the WTO needs to cooperate closely with governments, businesses, and international organizations to jointly address the challenges brought by the reconstruction of global value chains and contribute to the stability and prosperity of the global economy.</p>
