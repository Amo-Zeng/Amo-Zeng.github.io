            <h2>Technology Empowerment and Green Transformation: The Dual-Drive Role of Public Buildings in Urban Sustainable Development</h2>
            <p>Cities, as symbols of human civilization, are not only the core stage for future development but also the focal point of challenges and opportunities amidst global climate change and urbanization. Against the backdrop of increasingly severe climate change, how to achieve a balance between urban functionality and inclusivity, community vibrancy, and climate adaptability has become a major issue in global urban development. In this process, public buildings, with their unique dual roles, have emerged as the key hub for promoting urban sustainable development. Through technology empowerment, community vibrancy, and green transformation, public buildings not only carry the basic social functions but also play a pioneering and driving role in the sustainable development of cities.</p>
