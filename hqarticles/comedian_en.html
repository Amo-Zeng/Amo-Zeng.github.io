            <h3>Joke Archaeology: The Social Mirror Behind the Humor</h3>
            <p>The jokes of comedians often do not come out of thin air but are carefully refined and exaggerated transformations of real life, historical events, and social phenomena. Through "joke archaeology," we can not only trace the inspiration and creation background of classic jokes but also reveal the profound social insights and shared human emotional experiences hidden behind the humor. This "joke archaeology" is not only an exploration of the creative process of comedians but also a mirror of social culture, reflecting the changes in the times and the inner resonance of people.</p>

            <h3>Virtual Avatars: Multi-Faceted Performers in the Digital Era</h3>
            <p>In the era of social media, the role of comedians is no longer limited to the stage. They create "virtual avatars" that echo or contrast with their stage images through various digital platforms. These avatars not only expand their performance spaces but also profoundly influence their career development, fan interaction, and projection of real life. Studying the generation and operation mechanisms of these "virtual avatars" can reveal how comedians shape their multiple identities in the digital era and use these identities to establish deeper connections with the audience.</p>
