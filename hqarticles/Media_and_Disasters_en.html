            <h2>The Multidimensional Role of Media in Disaster Prevention and Psychological Reconstruction</h2>
            <p>In today's highly interconnected global society, media is not just a conveyor of information but also a crucial tool for disaster prevention, response, and subsequent psychological reconstruction. Through the comprehensive application of big data analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), social media, virtual reality (VR), and interactive media, media demonstrates its profound and multidimensional influence when facing natural and man-made disasters.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Media as a Disaster Prevention Tool</h3>
            <p><strong>Big Data and Disaster Prediction</strong>: Advances in modern technology have made it possible to gather vast amounts of data from meteorology, seismology, satellite imagery, and social media. Big data analysis can identify early signs of disasters, using complex predictive algorithms to warn of potential disaster events.</p>
            <p><strong>Application of AI</strong>: AI is not only used for prediction but is also an essential part of real-time monitoring and decision support systems. Through machine learning models, AI can forecast the likelihood and impact range of disasters, and analyze disaster information in real-time on social media using natural language processing technology.</p>
            <p><strong>Social Media as an Early Warning System</strong>: Platforms like Twitter and Weibo have become vital channels for the dissemination of disaster information. They not only quickly spread official warnings but also allow users to report signs of disasters or seek help, thereby enhancing the speed and efficiency of response.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>The Role of Media in Post-Disaster Psychological Reconstruction</h3>
            <p><strong>Psychological Support and Education</strong>: After a disaster, media provides psychological health education and support through news reports, special programs, and psychological support hotlines. They disseminate knowledge about psychological recovery, helping affected populations understand their emotional reactions and providing methods for self-regulation.</p>
            <p><strong>Virtual Reality (VR) Therapy</strong>: The application of VR in psychological reconstruction is increasingly noted, especially in treating PTSD. By simulating disaster scenes or creating relaxing virtual environments, VR can help patients gradually expose themselves to traumatic memories in a safe environment, reducing feelings of fear.</p>
            <p><strong>Games and Interactive Media</strong>: Interactive games like Minecraft can provide a virtual environment where disaster-affected individuals can regain a sense of control over their lives. Through in-game narratives and role-playing, players can explore different solutions and process trauma and emotions.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Media Manipulation and the Construction of Disaster Narratives</h3>
            <p><strong>Selective Reporting and Framing</strong>: Media shapes public understanding of disasters through selective reporting and framing. For example, selective reporting might be influenced by political, economic, or cultural factors, leading to a skewed perception of the disaster.</p>
            <p><strong>Narrative Strategies</strong>: Media uses dramatic techniques, specific language, and imagery to tell disaster stories, which not only attract viewers' attention but also guide their understanding of the disaster.</p>
            <p><strong>Influence of Cultural Background</strong>: Media coverage of disasters varies by cultural context, reflecting cultural values and affecting international aid distribution and policy-making.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The role of media in modern disaster management is multifaceted, from preventing and responding to disasters to aiding psychological reconstruction and shaping disaster narratives, its impact cannot be overlooked. However, this influence also brings challenges like data privacy, information overload, technological reliability, and media manipulation. Future developments should emphasize transparency, accountability, and equity in technology use to ensure that media applications in disaster management truly serve the public interest.</p>
