            <h2>Introduction (Theoretical Reconstruction)</h2>
            <p>Current human-machine collaboration systems face three core contradictions: 1) the adaptability disconnect between static algorithms and dynamic environments; 2) the inherent conflict between classical computing's deterministic logic and the fuzziness of the real world; 3) the misalignment between passive ethical frameworks and the need for active moral decision-making (refer to IEEE Transactions on Robotics 2023 review). The three-dimensional innovative solution proposed in this paper—Neuro-Dynamic Coupling System (NDCS), Quantum-Classical Cognitive Hybrid (QCCH), and Active Moral Reasoning Architecture (AMRA)—not only addresses existing technical bottlenecks but also redefines the philosophical foundation of human-machine relationships. Its innovation is reflected in: first introducing neural plasticity mechanisms into the machine learning closed-loop; establishing a mapping model between quantum probability clouds and classical control theory; proposing a game theory quantification framework for moral decision-making.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion and Outlook</h3>
            <p>The techno-ethical coevolution framework constructed in this paper will drive a qualitative transformation in human-machine relationships from "instrumental use" to "cognitive symbiosis." Next research priorities include: 1) developing long-term biocompatible materials for neural interfaces; 2) addressing energy efficiency bottlenecks in quantum-classical systems; 3) establishing a dynamic consensus mechanism for global ethical standards. These breakthroughs will ultimately realize the vision proposed by technophilosopher Donna Haraway in her "Cyborg Manifesto"—eliminating the essential boundaries between biology and machines.</p>
