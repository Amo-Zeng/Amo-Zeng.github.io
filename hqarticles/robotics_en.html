            <h3>1. Application of Eco-Friendly Materials</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bio-based Materials:</strong> Source: Renewable resources (e.g., corn starch, bamboo fiber); Advantages: Biodegradable, reduces reliance on petroleum-based plastics; Case: Robot shells made from bioplastics, balancing lightweight and environmental friendliness.</li>
                <li><strong>Recycled Materials:</strong> Source: Metals and plastics from discarded electronics; Advantages: Reduces resource consumption and production costs; Case: Circuit boards and shells using recycled metals, enabling secondary resource utilization.</li>
                <li><strong>Low-Energy Manufacturing Materials:</strong> Types: Aluminum alloy, magnesium alloy, etc.; Advantages: Low production energy consumption, high strength, lightweight; Effect: Reduces carbon emissions and improves robot energy efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>2. Modular Design Philosophy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Replaceable Modules:</strong> Design: Independent functional modules (sensors, batteries, actuators); Advantages: Partial replacement instead of complete disposal, reducing maintenance costs and electronic waste.</li>
                <li><strong>Upgrades and Expansion:</strong> Flexibility: Supports technological iterations (e.g., replacing new sensors); Effect: Extends lifespan and adapts to diverse needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Recycling and Reuse:</strong> Ease of Disassembly: Components are categorized for recycling, metals/plastics enter circular production; Cross-domain Reuse: Modules like motors and controllers are used in other devices.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>3. Challenges and Prospects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Cost: Higher initial investment in eco-friendly materials and modular design; Technical Bottlenecks: Need breakthroughs in material performance and manufacturing processes (e.g., strength and durability); Market Acceptance: Requires policy guidance and increased public environmental awareness.</li>
                <li><strong>Prospects:</strong> Technology-Driven: Advances in material science and manufacturing processes will reduce costs; Policy Support: Environmental regulations promote corporate transformation; Industry Trends: Green manufacturing becomes a core competency, modular design drives industry chain collaboration.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Sustainable robotics engineering achieves a win-win for environmental and economic benefits through eco-friendly materials and modular design. With technological innovation and growing social consensus, the robotics industry will accelerate its transition to a green, circular model, providing crucial support for global sustainable development goals.</p>
