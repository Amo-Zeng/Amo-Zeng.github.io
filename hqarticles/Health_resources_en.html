            <h3>I. Data Sharing: Creating the "Nervous System" for Healthcare Resource Allocation</h3>
            <h4>Current Situation: Inequitable Resource Allocation and Information Islands</h4>
            <p>Globally, disparities in healthcare resource distribution are prevalent. In developed countries, high-quality healthcare services and resources are highly concentrated in major cities, resulting in significant differences in healthcare services between urban and rural areas and regions. In China, this problem is equally pronounced, especially in primary healthcare institutions where outdated hardware, limited diagnostic capabilities, and an inability to meet residents' demand for high-quality healthcare services are common. Meanwhile, the phenomenon of information islands is severe, with data not being interconnected between medical institutions, making it impossible to share critical medical information such as medical records, test reports, and imaging data. This results in low resource utilization efficiency and increased medical costs for patients.</p>
            <h4>Innovative Approach: Building a Regional Health Data Sharing Platform</h4>
            <p>The key to solving this problem lies in constructing an efficient and secure health data sharing mechanism. Blockchain technology can ensure the security and privacy of the data sharing platform. The decentralized nature of blockchain makes data tampering nearly impossible, and through smart contracts and encryption, it can ensure privacy protection during data sharing. Additionally, big data analysis and artificial intelligence technology provide scientific bases for the precise allocation of healthcare resources. By analyzing regional health data, detailed healthcare demand profiles can be created, understanding the distribution and usage of healthcare resources in different areas, thereby optimizing resource allocation.</p>
            <h4>Expected Outcomes: Optimized Resource Allocation and Equitable Services</h4>
            <p>The construction of a data sharing platform will significantly improve the efficiency of healthcare resource utilization. By achieving interconnectivity of medical information, medical institutions can avoid redundant tests and resource waste, directing limited resources to the areas in greater need. Furthermore, the data sharing platform can promote balanced development of healthcare levels across different regions. By sharing high-quality healthcare resources and experiences, healthcare institutions in remote areas and smaller cities can receive more technological support and professional guidance, thereby enhancing their healthcare service quality.</p>

            <h3>II. Community Healthcare: Reconstructing the "Capillary" Network for Healthy China</h3>
            <h4>Current Situation: The Dilemma of Imbalanced Supply and Demand</h4>
            <p>While significant progress has been made in the construction of primary healthcare institutions in China, issues such as inadequate service capacity and severe talent attrition persist. The outdated hardware and limited diagnostic capabilities of primary healthcare institutions make it difficult to meet residents' demand for high-quality healthcare services. Patients lack trust in primary healthcare institutions, often "clustering" in large hospitals, resulting in ongoing issues of "difficulty and expense in seeking medical care."</p>
            <h4>Innovative Path: Activating the "Capillary" Network through Diverse Strategies</h4>
            <p>To address these challenges, innovative reforms are necessary to activate the "capillary" network of primary healthcare resources and build an efficient, convenient, and inclusive community healthcare system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resource Mobilization</strong>: By leveraging telemedicine and dispatching experts to primary healthcare institutions, high-quality healthcare resources can be "delivered" to communities, enhancing the diagnostic capabilities and service quality of primary healthcare institutions. Technologies such as teleconsultation and remote imaging diagnosis can break geographical barriers, allowing patients in primary care settings to receive equivalent healthcare services as those in large hospitals.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening the Workforce</strong>: Enhancing the construction of general practitioner teams, improving salary, promotion, and career development mechanisms to attract more outstanding medical students to serve in grassroots communities. Additionally, providing enhanced training for existing primary healthcare workers to improve their professional skills and service levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Empowerment</strong>: Utilizing smart wearable devices and mobile healthcare apps to extend medical services to communities and homes, creating a new "Internet + Community Healthcare" model. Residents can access health consultations, chronic disease management, and medication delivery through online platforms, enjoying more convenient and efficient healthcare services.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Expected Outcomes: Reconstructing the New Healthcare Landscape</h4>
            <p>With the continuous improvement of community healthcare services, the allocation of healthcare resources will become more balanced, and residents' medical experiences will significantly improve. The diagnostic capabilities and service quality of primary healthcare institutions will be significantly enhanced, better meeting the basic healthcare needs of residents. As the service capacity of primary healthcare institutions improves, patients will be more inclined to seek medical care at their doorstep, effectively alleviating the pressure on large hospitals and optimizing the allocation of healthcare resources.</p>
