            <p>In the restructuring of global governance, the rise of civil society has become an undeniable force. For a long time, international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Bank have dominated the agenda and action framework of global governance. However, with the rise of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), social movements, and advocates for digital rights, the power structure of global governance is undergoing profound changes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global Mobilization of Civil Society</strong>  
                    The普及 of the internet and the lowering of communication costs have enabled civil society to transcend geographical and cultural boundaries, forming global mobilization networks. For example, the "Black Lives Matter" movement rapidly expanded globally through social media, demonstrating the strong mobilization capabilities of civil society on transnational issues. This mobilization not only challenges traditional international relations theories but also provides new forms of participation in global governance.</li>
                <li><strong>Transformation and Adjustment of International Organizations</strong>  
                    Faced with the rise of civil society, traditional international organizations have had to adjust their operational models. For instance, in the formulation process of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the extensive participation of NGOs has become an undeniable force. This participation not only injects more local wisdom and innovative thinking into global governance but also pushes international organizations towards greater openness and inclusiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>Expansion of Global Civil Rights</strong>  
                    The participation of civil society directly promotes the expansion of global civil rights. Issues such as digital rights, data privacy protection, and climate justice transcend traditional national boundaries, becoming global rights claims. This expansion of rights not only challenges traditional international law and theories but also provides a new legitimacy foundation for global governance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>III. Decentralized International Organizations: A New Paradigm for Global Governance</h3>
            <p>Against the backdrop of traditional international organizations facing legitimacy crises and efficiency bottlenecks, the rise of decentralized international organizations offers new possibilities for global governance. The application of emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence enables decentralized organizations to operate at lower costs and higher efficiencies, reshaping the paradigm of global governance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Innovative Advantages of Decentralized Organizations</strong>  
                    The flat structure, open participation mechanisms, and efficient technical support of decentralized organizations give them unique advantages in global governance. For example, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) based on blockchain technology, without traditional hierarchical structures and management models, can achieve global collaboration and governance. This organizational form not only improves decision transparency and efficiency but also provides new collaboration models for global governance.</li>
                <li><strong>New Approaches to Addressing Global Challenges</strong>  
                    Decentralized organizations can respond more quickly to global challenges such as climate change and digital governance. By pooling global wisdom and resources, decentralized organizations can offer more innovative and inclusive solutions. For instance, in digital governance, decentralized organizations use blockchain technology to provide new paths for global data sharing and privacy protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenges and Opportunities Coexist</strong>  
                    The rise of decentralized organizations also faces numerous challenges, such as legitimacy, representation, and technical risks. However, these challenges also provide new exploration spaces for global governance innovation. For example, how to ensure the legitimacy and representativeness of decentralized organizations while avoiding the risks of technology misuse will be an important issue in future global governance.</li>
