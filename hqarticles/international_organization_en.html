            <h2>Transformation of International Organizations in Global Governance: From Rule-Making to Action-Leading</h2>
            <p>As the process of globalization continues to deepen, international organizations are undergoing unprecedented role transformations. From the competition between digital hegemony and global co-governance, to the paradigm shift in climate governance from commitments to practice, and to the innovative breakthroughs in public health governance from emergency response to long-term resilience building, international organizations have evolved from mere "behind-the-scenes rule-makers" to "action leaders" in global governance. This transformation not only underscores the complexity and urgency of global challenges but also highlights the unique value and boundless potential of international organizations in addressing these challenges.</p>

            <h3>1. Digital Hegemony vs. Global Co-Governance: The Bridging Role of International Organizations in Digital Governance</h3>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technologies is reshaping the global political and economic landscape, with data, algorithms, and platforms becoming the "oil" and "engines" of the new era. International organizations are playing an increasingly important role in this historic transformation, striving to build a fair and inclusive global digital governance framework to address emerging challenges such as data sovereignty, algorithmic fairness, and platform monopolies. However, behind this seemingly fair global co-governance lies a profound博弈 between digital hegemony and global co-governance, the future of which will profoundly affect the global digital landscape.</p>
            <p>While international organizations claim to be "neutral" and "impartial," the digital governance frameworks they lead are still marked by Western values and interests. The privacy protection rules represented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <strong>emphasize the primacy of individual data rights, reflecting the Western society's high regard for personal freedom.</strong> In contrast, technology-advanced countries led by the United States are more inclined towards data free flow and commercial interests, <strong>with their "data free flow" concept being a contest for global digital economy leadership.</strong></p>
            <p>Developing countries are not passive recipients of this博弈. They are actively striving for digital sovereignty, <strong>calling for a more fair and inclusive global digital governance system,</strong> and seeking a voice in rule-making and benefit distribution. The future of global digital governance will present a complex scenario of cooperation and competition coexisting. International organizations will continue to play a bridging role, <strong>facilitating dialogue and cooperation among countries in areas such as data security and AI ethics,</strong> but the博弈 of digital hegemony will also persist, <strong>with intense competition between Western countries and developing nations in rule-making and benefit distribution.</strong></p>
            <p>Global digital governance should not become a "tool of digital hegemony" for a few countries but should be a common platform for promoting global digital economy prosperity, safeguarding digital human rights, and maintaining digital sovereignty. In the future, <strong>international organizations need to uphold multilateralism,</strong> fully respect the development stages and interests of different countries, <strong>building a diverse and inclusive digital governance system,</strong> and promote global digital governance towards a fairer, more efficient, and sustainable direction.</p>

            <h3>2. From Rhetoric to Action: Paradigm Shift in Climate Governance by International Organizations</h3>
            <p>For a long time, international organizations have played the role of a "rhetoric stage" in global climate governance, <strong>serving as a platform for governments, NGOs, and stakeholders to discuss climate policies.</strong> However, as the global climate crisis becomes increasingly urgent, the functions of international organizations are undergoing profound changes, <strong>evolving from mere negotiation platforms to action catalysts,</strong> pushing global climate governance from "commitments" to "practice."</p>
            <p><strong>Developing countries face dual challenges of technological gaps and financial constraints.</strong> International organizations, through the establishment of technology transfer platforms, provision of capacity-building services, and bridging financial gaps, help developing countries access advanced low-carbon technologies and enhance their capacity to respond to climate change. <strong>For example, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) through its "Renewable Energy Solutions Platform,"</strong> provides customized technical solutions for countries, <strong>promoting the widespread adoption of renewable energy.</strong> The Green Climate Fund (GCF) offers concessionary loans, grants, and technical assistance to <strong>help developing countries implement projects for adapting to and mitigating climate change.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>The formulation of climate policies requires scientific evidence and expertise.</strong> International organizations, with their professionalism and authority, provide policy recommendations and decision-making references to countries, <strong>helping them develop scientifically sound and reasonable climate policies.</strong> The UNFCCC Secretariat regularly publishes "Guidelines for National Determined Contributions (NDCs) Reporting," <strong>guiding countries in compiling and updating their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs),</strong> ensuring the scientific and feasibility of their targets.</p>
            <p><strong>Climate action requires transparency and credibility.</strong> International organizations establish global climate monitoring and assessment systems, monitoring and evaluating countries' carbon emissions and renewable energy deployment, <strong>ensuring the transparency of target achievements,</strong> and providing data support for global climate governance. The IEA's "Global Energy Monitoring Report" offers detailed data support for global energy transition.</p>

            <h3>3. From Emergency Response to Long-Term Resilience Building: Innovative Roles of International Organizations in Global Public Health Governance</h3>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic served as a mirror, <strong>reflecting the vulnerabilities and shortcomings of the global public health governance system.</strong> In the early stages of the pandemic, <strong>slow responses, poor information sharing, and uneven distribution of medical resources among countries were exposed,</strong> highlighting the shortcomings of global health governance mechanisms in emergency response. <strong>However, international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI)</strong> demonstrated strong adaptability and innovation during the crisis, <strong>not only efficiently coordinating the distribution of global抗疫 resources</strong> but also taking a forward-looking perspective to promote the long-term resilience building of the global health system, <strong>laying a solid foundation for应对 future potential global public health crises.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>In the initial stages of the pandemic, the focus of international organizations was primarily on emergency response,</strong> such as coordinating the sharing of pandemic information, providing technical support, and offering material assistance. <strong>However, as the pandemic progressed, international organizations gradually realized</strong> that mere emergency response could not fundamentally solve the problem, <strong>and that a longer-term goal — building a more resilient global health governance system — must be pursued.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>International organizations have promoted the resilience of the global health system through innovative measures such as strengthening public health infrastructure, enhancing disease surveillance capabilities, and fostering international cooperation.</strong> For example, <strong>GAVI through the "COVID-19 Vaccine Implementation Plan" (COVAX),</strong> provides vaccine supply guarantees for low- and middle-income countries, <strong>helping them establish a robust vaccination system.</strong> The WHO's "Global Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Framework" (GARPR) <strong>aims to improve countries'应对能力 for public health emergencies.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>International organizations also actively advocate the "One Health" concept,</strong> emphasizing the close relationship between human health, animal health, and environmental health, <strong>calling for collaborative efforts to address cross-sector challenges such as zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance.</strong> The WHO, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) jointly launched the "Global Health Initiative for Zoonoses" (GHGI), <strong>aiming to strengthen intersectoral cooperation and jointly应对 global public health threats.</strong></p>
