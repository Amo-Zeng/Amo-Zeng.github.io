            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the vast universe, dark matter accounts for about 85% of the total mass, yet our understanding of it is akin to facing an unknown deep sea. Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Geneva, Switzerland, lies the world's largest particle physics laboratoryâ€”CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), where massive particle accelerators are accelerating protons to near the speed of light, exploring the deepest mysteries of the cosmos. From "pursuing dark matter" to "creating dark matter," from particle collisions to energy revolutions, humanity's exploration of the ultimate cosmic mysteries never ceases. The next-generation particle collider, as a boundary breaker in the revolution of physics, will lead us to an unprecedented new era of science.</p>

            <h2>Detection and Creation: Challenges and Future of Dark Matter</h2>
            <h3>Detecting Dark Matter: Current Status and Challenges</h3>
            <p>Dark matter detection experiments worldwide mainly focus on direct and indirect detection methods. Direct detection experiments look for weak interactions between dark matter particles and ordinary matter, while indirect detection observes annihilation or decay products of dark matter particles in the universe. LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) and XENON1T are two typical examples of direct detection experiments, using ultra-pure liquid xenon as a detection medium to capture signals from collisions between dark matter particles and xenon nuclei.</p>
            <p>However, detecting dark matter faces significant challenges. The interaction between dark matter particles and ordinary matter is extremely weak, resulting in very sparse signals. Background noise interference makes the interpretation of experimental results extremely complex. Although LZ and XENON1T have made significant progress in sensitivity and detection depth, no definitive dark matter signals have been found so far, indicating that current detection methods may not be sufficient to reveal the nature of dark matter.</p>
            <h3>Creating Dark Matter: Goals of Next-Generation Experiments</h3>
            <p>As the limitations of detection experiments become apparent, scientists are beginning to consider a more radical goal: not just detecting dark matter, but creating and manipulating dark matter particles. High-energy particle colliders are the key tools to achieve this goal. By colliding particles, scientists can simulate the extreme conditions of the early universe, creating a high-energy particle environment. In such an environment, dark matter particles may emerge through high-energy interactions between particles. For example, CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has already found some indirect evidence in the search for dark matter particles, although they have not been observed directly.</p>
            <p>Future collider experiments will further enhance energy and precision, attempting to directly produce dark matter particles in the laboratory. If successful, this will be the first time in human history that dark matter has been created in a controlled environment, marking a new era in our understanding of the universe.</p>

            <h2>The Practical Implications of Particle Collisions: From Medicine to Energy</h2>
            <h3>Particle Collisions Illuminate Life: Revolution in Medical Isotopes and Cancer Treatment</h3>
            <p>CERN's particle physics experiments have brought revolutionary changes to human health. Radioactive isotopes produced by high-energy particle beams impacting target materials are now widely used in medical diagnosis and treatment. For instance, strontium-89 isotopes produced using CERN technology effectively relieve bone cancer pain and extend patients' lives. These medical isotopes act like "messengers of life," using their radioactive properties to mark diseased cells and provide doctors with precise diagnostic information.</p>
            <p>Moreover, CERN has developed cancer treatment methods based on particle accelerators. Proton beam therapy uses high-energy protons to precisely target tumors, minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues and bringing new hope to cancer patients.</p>
            <h3>Energy Transformation and Renewal: Future Scenarios of Safe and Efficient Nuclear Energy Utilization</h3>
            <p>In addition to the medical field, particle physics experiments also hold significant promise in the energy sector. Accelerator-Driven Sub-Critical Systems (ADS) are a prime example. This innovative nuclear energy system uses high-energy proton beams to drive sub-critical reactors, making nuclear energy utilization safer and more efficient and solving the problem of spent fuel disposal.</p>
            <p>The ADS system uses accelerators to generate high-energy protons that bombard heavy metal targets, producing neutrons that trigger nuclear fission reactions in sub-critical reactors. This design not only improves the efficiency of nuclear energy utilization but also significantly reduces the risk of nuclear accidents, providing a more sustainable clean energy solution for humanity.</p>

            <h2>Next-Generation Particle Colliders: The Boundary Breakers of the Physics Revolution</h2>
            <h3>The Spear of the Boundary Breaker: Higher, Faster, Stronger</h3>
            <p>The design goals of the next-generation particle colliders can be summarized in three words: higher, faster, stronger.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Higher Energy:</strong> To explore deeper structures of matter, discover new particles, and validate cutting-edge theories like string theory, the next-generation colliders need to raise energy levels to unprecedented heights. For example, China's planned Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) will reach 100 TeV, seven times the energy of the current LHC.</li>
                <li><strong>Faster Collisions:</strong> Higher luminosity means producing more particle collisions per unit of time, increasing the probability of discovering new phenomena. Next-generation colliders will adopt more advanced accelerator technologies and more precise detectors to achieve higher luminosity.</li>
                <li><strong>Stronger Performance:</strong> While pursuing higher energy and faster collisions, the next-generation colliders must also overcome significant technical challenges, such as controlling high-energy particle beams, reducing radiation damage, and processing massive amounts of data.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Shield of the Boundary Breaker: Challenges and Breakthroughs</h3>
            <p>The construction and operation of the next-generation particle colliders face unprecedented technical challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Superconducting Magnets:</strong> To accelerate particles to higher energies, strong magnetic fields are needed to guide particle beams. Superconducting magnets are the key technology to achieve this, but they are costly to manufacture, require extremely low operating temperatures, and present numerous technical difficulties.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Each collision experiment generates massive amounts of data. Efficiently storing, transmitting, and analyzing this data is a major challenge for the next-generation colliders. New technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum computing are expected to play important roles in the future.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Control:</strong> The construction and operation costs of the next-generation colliders are extremely high. How to reduce costs and make them more widely applicable in scientific and industrial fields is an urgent issue to address.</li>
            </ul>
