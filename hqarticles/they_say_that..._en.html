            <h2>The Spark of Civilization: From Campfires to Social Media, How Legends Shape the Human Psyche</h2>
            <p>From ancient campfires to modern social media, legends have always been the spark of civilization, illuminating humanity's quest for meaning, order, and eternity. Whether it's primitive humans sitting around the fire or modern individuals scrolling through their phone screens, we are all weaving common psychological codes through stories. These narratives not only shape our cultural identities but also reveal the shared spiritual core of humanity through cross-temporal transmission.</p>

            <h3>1. Campfires and Mythology: The Cradle of the Human Psyche</h3>
            <p>In the dawn of human civilization, campfires were not just physical light sources dispelling darkness, but also spiritual fountains of collective imagination. When primitive humans huddled around the fire on cold nights, the flickering flames reflected their fears of the unknown and desires for life's meaning. In this atmosphere, myths, as the earliest legends, were woven. Myths are not mere descriptions of the objective world but representations of the human inner world. Through tales of creation, heroic adventures, and the cycle of life and death, primitive humans sought to explain the origins of the world, cope with the fear of death, and find ways to transcend themselves.</p>

            <h3>2. Social Media and Viral Spread: The Fission and Symbiosis of Legends in Modern Times</h3>
            <p>In the era of social media, the way legends are transmitted has undergone revolutionary changes. The viral nature of online content allows a simple video or meme to be clicked billions of times in a short period. This not only changes the speed of information transmission but also profoundly affects the reproduction of cultural symbols and the restructuring of social memory. Social media provides new fertile ground for legends, enabling them to be deconstructed and reconstructed in a modern context.</p>
