            <h2>Legends as Encoding Systems of Cultural Memory</h2>
            <p>As carriers of social memory, legends serve dual functions of preserving the past while responding to reality. This encoding system continuously adapts its functions over time, as seen in the transformation of Guan Yu from a historical figure to a deified image.</p>
            <p>The authenticity of legends is often shaped by power structures. Colonizers justified land appropriation through the myth of terra nullius (no man's land), while indigenous peoples used Dreamtime legends to assert land rights. This politics of authenticity reveals the close relationship between narrative power and power structures.</p>

            <h3>Globalization and Cross-Cultural Transmission Variations</h3>
            <p>Digital media and social platforms have revolutionized the transmission pathways of traditional legends. Marvel movies have reshaped Thor from Norse mythology into a superhero image, detaching it from its original cultural context.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cultural Adaptation:</strong> The Legend of the White Snake was simplified into a love story in the West, losing its original Taoist connotations and gender power dynamics</li>
                <li><strong>Recreation:</strong> Vampire legends merged with East Asian zombie culture, creating new cultural variants</li>
                <li><strong>Meaning Erosion:</strong> Western adaptations of Eastern legends often omit religious rituals, leading to cultural distortion</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Balancing Cultural Preservation and Innovation</h3>
            <p>Global transmission presents dual challenges:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cultural Homogenization Risk:</strong> Dominant cultures' hegemonic adaptations of minority cultures' legends</li>
                <li><strong>Innovation Opportunities:</strong> Cross-cultural fusion generating new art forms and expressions</li>
                <li><strong>Authenticity Debates:</strong> Defining boundaries between cultural appropriation and legitimate adaptation</li>
                <li><strong>Transmission Strategies:</strong> The need to convey both surface stories and underlying cultural logics</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusions and Future Perspectives</h3>
            <p>As important carriers of cultural memory, legends hold value in preserving cultural roots while acquiring contemporary significance. Future transmission should focus on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Establishing interactive dialogue mechanisms between local and global contexts</li>
                <li>Avoiding unidirectional cultural exports</li>
                <li>Developing deep transmission strategies beyond surface narratives</li>
                <li>Balancing cultural preservation with innovation needs</li>
            </ul>
