            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The energy budget of galaxies is a complex multi-scale problem involving various energy processes from microscopic to macroscopic levels. Dark matter and dark energy dominate the gravitational structure of galaxies and the expansion of the universe, directly influencing the evolution and energy distribution of galaxies. Meanwhile, microscopic energy processes in the interstellar medium, such as cosmic rays, magnetic fields, and chemical reactions, play a crucial role in star formation and gas dynamics. Furthermore, energy transfer and feedback mechanisms on intergalactic scales, particularly the flow of hot gases in galaxy clusters and the activity of supermassive black holes, further shape the long-term evolution of galaxies. This article will explore the core issues of galactic energy budget from these three scales, revealing their interactions and comprehensive impacts.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The energy budget of galaxies is not only the result of internal physical processes but also profoundly influenced by cosmological scales and surrounding environments. Traditional research has primarily focused on energy flow involving stars, gas, and radiation. However, the dominant roles of dark matter and dark energy, as well as microscopic energy processes in the interstellar medium, are gradually unveiling deeper mechanisms of galactic evolution. Additionally, energy transfer and feedback mechanisms on intergalactic scales, such as gas flow in galaxy clusters and the activity of supermassive black holes, provide new perspectives for understanding the long-term evolution of galaxies.</p>

            <h3>I. Dark Matter and Dark Energy: The Cosmological Context of Galactic Evolution</h3>
            <h4>1.1 Dominant Role of Dark Matter</h4>
            <p>Dark matter is the primary driver of the gravitational structure of galaxies. Its distribution and density profile determine the shape, stability, and history of star formation in galaxies. The gravitational potential of dark matter halos influences the distribution and motion of gas clouds, regulating the efficiency of star formation. Additionally, high-density regions of dark matter may accelerate the growth of supermassive black holes, thereby affecting the energy balance of galaxies.</p>
            <h4>1.2 Influence of Dark Energy</h4>
            <p>The existence of dark energy causes the accelerated expansion of the universe, weakening the gravitational bonds between galaxies and affecting their distribution and structure. Accelerated expansion may also trigger outflows of gas within galaxies, altering the distribution and density of gas, thereby reducing the star formation rate. However, in some cases, dark energy may increase gas supply through changes in galaxy interactions, stimulating star formation.</p>
            <h4>1.3 Construction of Comprehensive Models</h4>
            <p>By integrating the effects of dark matter and dark energy, we can construct a comprehensive model of the galactic energy budget. This model not only needs to consider energy flow within galaxies but also incorporate cosmological background conditions. Future research should continue to improve simulation accuracy and explore new observational methods to quantify the contributions of these dark components more accurately.</p>

            <h3>II. Microscopic Energy Processes in the Interstellar Medium: The Microscopic Basis of Star Formation</h3>
            <h4>2.1 Energy Transfer by Cosmic Rays and Magnetic Fields</h4>
            <p>Cosmic rays transfer energy to the interstellar medium through collisions with gas molecules, heating and turbulently moving the gas. Meanwhile, magnetic fields drive energy flow in the gas through processes like magnetic reconnection and magnetic turbulence, influencing its distribution and dynamical state. These microscopic processes collectively regulate the temperature and density of the interstellar medium, thereby determining the rate of star formation.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Energy Budget of Chemical Reactions</h4>
            <p>Chemical reactions in the interstellar medium, such as the formation and fragmentation of molecular clouds, are important pathways for energy release and absorption. The cooling rate of molecular clouds is closely related to their chemical composition, and the energy budget of chemical reactions directly affects the evolution of the interstellar medium and the history of star formation. By studying these microscopic energy processes, we can gain a deeper understanding of galactic energy flow.</p>

            <h3>III. Intergalactic Energy Transfer and Feedback: The Macroscopic Environment of Galaxies</h3>
            <h4>3.1 Energy Transfer in Galaxy Clusters and Groups</h4>
            <p>Hot gas in galaxy clusters and groups loses energy through radiative cooling, potentially leading to star formation in galaxies. However, feedback mechanisms such as supernova explosions and active galactic nuclei can heat the gas, suppressing excessive star formation. Additionally, the accretion of cold gas and interactions between galaxies further regulate the energy budget of galaxies.</p>
            <h4>3.2 Intergalactic Feedback from Supermassive Black Holes</h4>
            <p>Supermassive black holes inject energy into the intergalactic medium through jets and radiation, inhibiting cooling flows and regulating the star formation rate of galaxies. Meanwhile, the gravitational effects of black holes may influence the dynamical state of galaxy clusters, regulating their energy distribution. These feedback mechanisms play a crucial role in the long-term evolution of galaxies.</p>

            <h3>IV. Multi-scale Integration: Future Directions for Galactic Energy Budget</h3>
            <h4>4.1 Integration of Multi-scale Models</h4>
            <p>Future research needs to integrate the cosmological background of dark matter and dark energy, microscopic energy processes in the interstellar medium, and intergalactic energy transfer and feedback mechanisms into a unified model. Through high-resolution numerical simulations and diverse observational data, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of galactic energy flow.</p>
            <h4>4.2 Breakthroughs in Observation and Experimentation</h4>
            <p>New observational techniques, such as multi-wavelength imaging and radio observations, will further reveal microscopic energy processes in the interstellar medium. Meanwhile, larger-scale numerical simulations will help us understand the complex interactions of dark matter and dark energy.</p>
            <h4>4.3 Advances in Theoretical Models</h4>
            <p>Improving theoretical models of dark matter and dark energy, exploring new microscopic energy processes, and studying intergalactic feedback mechanisms will provide new theoretical foundations for research on galactic energy budgets.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The energy budget of galaxies is a multi-scale complex problem involving various energy processes from microscopic to macroscopic levels. Dark matter and dark energy dominate the gravitational structure and expansion of the universe, microscopic energy processes in the interstellar medium regulate star formation, and intergalactic energy transfer and feedback mechanisms shape the long-term evolution of galaxies. By integrating the findings from these scales, we can construct a comprehensive model of the galactic energy budget, providing new insights into understanding the structure and evolution of the universe. Future research should continue to explore the interactions between these scales to reveal the complete picture of galactic energy flow.</p>
