            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Feynman Path Integral, introduced by Richard Feynman in the 1940s, presents a novel formulation of quantum mechanics. Its core idea is to compute the probability amplitude of a particle moving from one point to another by summing over all possible paths. This approach not only brought profound changes in physics but also demonstrated significant potential across various disciplines. This article will explore the innovative applications of the Feynman Path Integral in quantum computing, biophysics and chemistry, and finance and economics, revealing its interdisciplinary impact and insights.</p>

            <h3>Basic Concepts of Feynman Path Integral</h3>
            <p>The theoretical foundation of the Feynman Path Integral lies in the notion that the movement of a particle from an initial to a final state is not through a single path but a quantum superposition of all possible paths, with each path's contribution determined by its "action":</p>
            <p>\[ U(t_f, t_i) = \int D[x(t)] \exp\left\{\frac{i}{\hbar}S[x(t)]\right\} \]</p>
            <p>Here, \(S[x(t)]\) is the action along the path, and \(D[x(t)]\) represents the integration over all possible paths. This method highlights the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, allowing for quantum interference through all possible paths.</p>
