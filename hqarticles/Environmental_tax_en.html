            <h1>AI Development and Privacy Challenges</h1>
            <p>Modern artificial intelligence systems require vast amounts of data for training and optimization, which often contains sensitive personal information. As machine learning models become more sophisticated, their ability to extract insights - and potentially uncover private information from datasets raises significant ethical and security concerns.</p>

        <section id="protection-strategies">
            <h2>Technical Protection Measures</h2>
            <p>The industry has developed various approaches to address these challenges, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data anonymization techniques</strong> - Removing personally identifiable information from datasets</li>
                <li><strong>Differential privacy</strong> - Adding mathematical noise to data to prevent individual identification</li>
                <li><strong>Federated learning</strong> - Training models across decentralized devices without sharing raw data</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="policy-role">
            <h2>Policy and Regulatory Framework</h2>
            <p>Legal frameworks like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) have established important user rights including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Right to access and delete personal data</li>
                <li>Right to opt-out of data sales</li>
                <li>Right to know what data is being collected</li>
            </ul>
