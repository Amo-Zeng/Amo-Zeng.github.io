            <h2>Social Justice and Planned Economy: Application of Modern Technology and Policy Measures</h2>
            <p>Planned economy as a model of economic management has one of its core objectives to achieve social justice, ensuring the equitable distribution of resources and wealth. However, traditional planned economies often face issues like inefficiency, information asymmetry, and bureaucracy, leading to social inequality and a lack of fairness. This article explores how modern technology and policy measures can improve the performance of planned economies in terms of social justice.</p>

            <h3>Income and Wealth Redistribution</h3>
            <p><strong>Income and wealth redistribution</strong> is crucial for achieving social justice. Through precise redistribution policies, a planned economy can effectively reduce social inequality. Here are some specific measures:</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Achieving social justice is a vital goal for planned economies, yet it faces many challenges.
