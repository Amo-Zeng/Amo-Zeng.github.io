            <h2>The Future of Stage Design: Integrating Virtual Reality, Sustainability, and Interdisciplinary Collaboration</h2>
            <p>With the continuous advancement of technology, the field of stage design is undergoing unprecedented changes. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies, sustainable design, and interdisciplinary collaboration are collectively shaping a more innovative, environmentally friendly, and efficient future for stage design. This article will explore how these technologies are transforming stage design, analyze specific case studies of their applications, and look ahead to future trends.</p>

            <h3>The Application of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality Technologies</h3>
            <p><strong>Virtual Reality (VR)</strong> and <strong>Augmented Reality (AR)</strong> technologies have evolved from concepts in science fiction to practical tools in the real world, especially in the creative industries. These technologies are changing the way stage designers work, providing them with unprecedented design freedom and innovation space.</p>
            <p><strong>Virtual Reality (VR)</strong> is a computer-simulated system that creates and allows the experience of virtual worlds. It uses devices such as Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) to fully immerse users in a virtual environment. In stage design, VR technology enables designers to build and test their designs in a completely virtual environment without the need to construct physical models. This immersive design experience not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of the design but also allows designers to experience the stage effects from the audience's perspective, leading to more reasonable adjustments.</p>
            <p><strong>Augmented Reality (AR)</strong> is a technology that overlays digital information onto the real world, achieved through devices such as smartphones, tablets, or AR glasses. In stage design, AR technology can be used to preview design effects in the actual venue. Designers can see virtual stage sets and lighting effects on-site, which helps them better understand how the design will perform in the real environment and make necessary adjustments.</p>
            <h4>Case Studies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Case Study 1: Stage Design for "The Lion King"</strong>
                    <p>In the stage design for the Broadway musical "The Lion King," designers used AR technology to preview complex stage mechanics and set effects. Through AR glasses, designers could see virtual sets and mechanical movements on the actual stage, which not only helped optimize the mechanical design but also ensured the safety and smoothness of the performance.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Case Study 2: Immersive Design Experience for "Hamilton"</strong>
                    <p>The designers of the musical "Hamilton" used VR technology to create a virtual theater environment where designers and directors could collaboratively explore stage layouts, lighting effects, and actor movements. This immersive design experience greatly improved team collaboration efficiency, making the final stage effects even more impressive.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Case Study 3: Interactive Stage for "Frozen"</strong>
                    <p>In the Disney musical "Frozen," AR technology was used to create interactive stage effects. Audience members, through AR glasses, could see virtual snowflakes, ice sculptures, and other elements that seamlessly integrated with the live performance, providing an unprecedented immersive experience.</p>

            <h3>Sustainable Design and Environmental Protection</h3>
            <p>As global awareness of environmental protection increases, the field of stage design is also exploring ways to reduce its environmental impact. Sustainable design is not only an art but also a responsibility. Designers are beginning to consider how to...</p>
