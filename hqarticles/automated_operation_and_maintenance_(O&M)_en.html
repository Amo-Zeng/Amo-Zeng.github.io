            <h2>New Thinking and Ecosystem Building in Digital Transformation</h2>
            <p>Under the impetus of Industry 4.0 and the digital wave, enterprises are undergoing profound changes in their operations models and digital transformation paths. From traditional reactive operations to data-driven predictive operations, and then to preventive operations, the operational thinking of enterprises is gradually shifting from "treating diseases" to "maintaining health." Meanwhile, digital transformation is moving from the limitations of "single tool integration" towards "ecosystem building" with openness and collaboration, and further evolving into "business-oriented" digital thinking, marking enterprises' transition from local technical optimization to global value creation.</p>

            <h3>I. The Leap in Operational Thinking: From "Treating Diseases" to "Maintaining Health"</h3>
            <p>In the initial stages of digital transformation, enterprises generally adopted predictive operations models. These models use technologies such as sensors, the Internet of Things, and big data analysis to monitor equipment status in real time, predict potential failures, and take preventive measures. However, predictive operations have limitations: they rely excessively on data and models, lack proactive intervention, and are challenging to manage in complex systems.</p>
            <p>Preventive operations further elevate operational concepts. It no longer focuses solely on "predicting" failures but analyzes the root causes of failures at the system level, preventing them through optimized design, improved processes, and enhanced management. This "root-cause" operational model emphasizes systems thinking, root analysis, and proactive intervention, enabling enterprises to shift from "passively waiting for failures" to "actively eliminating potential risks," truly achieving a leap from "treating diseases" to "maintaining health."</p>

            <h3>II. The Dilemma of Digital Transformation: From "Single Tool Integration" to "Ecosystem Building"</h3>
            <p>In the early stages of digital transformation, many enterprises adopted a "single tool integration" strategy, introducing point tools such as CRM, ERP, or data analysis platforms for specific business needs. However, this approach led to issues such as information silos, fragmented business processes, high costs, and limited innovation.</p>
            <p>To address these challenges, enterprises need to shift from "single tool integration" to "ecosystem building." By creating interconnected, collaborative digital ecosystems, enterprises can break down tool barriers and achieve comprehensive integration of data, business, and ecosystems. This transformation path includes: establishing user-centric design philosophies, building open and shared technology platforms (such as API economies and data hubs), fostering collaborative and win-win partner ecosystems, and establishing continuous iterative optimization mechanisms.</p>

            <h3>III. The Leap in Thinking: From "Problem-Oriented" to "Business-Oriented"</h3>
            <p>Traditional digital construction often adopts a "problem-oriented" thinking model, selecting technical solutions for specific issues. However, this model can lead to "technical silos," trapping enterprises in a "treating symptoms rather than causes" dilemma. More importantly, this approach neglects the deep integration of digitalization with business, hindering the formation of true competitive advantages.</p>
            <p>"Business-oriented" digital thinking emphasizes starting from business value and using digital capabilities as the core driving force for business development. This shift in thinking marks a deeper stage in the development of enterprise digital construction. By building unified digital platforms, enterprises can streamline business processes, enabling efficient data flow and value extraction. For example, the retail industry has transitioned from traditional inventory management and checkout optimization to building omnichannel retail platforms, deeply integrating online and offline operations to create new retail experiences.</p>

            <h3>IV. From Technical Transformation to Value Creation: Building Intelligent, Proactive Operations and Digital Ecosystems</h3>
            <p>Achieving the leap from "problem-oriented" to "business-oriented" thinking requires systematic changes at multiple levels:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Establishing Cross-Departmental Collaboration Mechanisms</strong>: Forming cross-functional teams to break down departmental barriers and effectively link business needs with technical capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultivating Digital Thinking Skills</strong>: Managers need to consider digital construction from a holistic business perspective, integrating digital capabilities into enterprise strategy.</li>
                <li><strong>Building a Continuous Innovation Ecosystem</strong>: Collaborating with ecosystem partners to create open, cooperative digital ecosystems, integrating industry resources, and exploring new business models.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In the operations field, preventive operations will evolve towards intelligence and automation. The application of artificial intelligence, digital twins, and other technologies will enable more accurate risk identification, effective measures, and comprehensive improvement in equipment health. In digital transformation, enterprises need to embrace change with an open mindset, actively build open, shared, and collaborative digital ecosystems, achieve comprehensive integration of data, business, and ecosystems, and unlock the value of digitalization.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>From predictive operations to preventive operations, from "single tool integration" to "ecosystem building," and from "problem-oriented" to "business-oriented" thinking, enterprises are undergoing a profound digital transformation. This transformation is not only a technological update but also a fundamental shift in thinking and operational models. Preventive operations and digital ecosystem building will become key to enhancing competitiveness, while "business-oriented" digital thinking marks the transition from local optimization to global value creation. Only by achieving deep integration of digitalization and business can enterprises remain competitive in the future, driving the entire business world into a new stage of development.</p>
