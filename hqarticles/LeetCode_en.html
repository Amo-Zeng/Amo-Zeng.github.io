            <h4>1. The Root of Anxiety: A Psychological Interpretation</h4>
            <p>Anxiety is a common emotional response to challenging tasks, especially in the context of LeetCode problem-solving. The root causes include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Expectation vs. Reality Gap</strong>: Many programmers start problem-solving with high expectations, believing they should easily solve all problems after some effort. The gap between these expectations and reality leads to frustration and heightened anxiety.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Comparison</strong>: Seeing othersâ€™ high-difficulty problem-solving records and successful interview stories on social media can lead to feelings of inadequacy and anxiety.</li>
                <li><strong>Time Pressure and Urgency</strong>: Many problem-solve to prepare for upcoming interviews, and the time constraints increase anxiety when faced with difficult problems.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Psychological Strategies to Overcome Anxiety</h4>
            <h5>1. Cognitive Restructuring: From "I'm Not Good Enough" to "I'm Making Progress"</h5>
            <p>Cognitive restructuring is a core technique in cognitive-behavioral therapy, aimed at alleviating emotional distress by altering one's thought patterns. In LeetCode problem-solving:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identify Negative Thoughts</strong>: When stuck, negative self-evaluations like "I'm so dumb" or "I'll never figure this out" often arise.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenge Negative Thoughts</strong>: Question these thoughts, such as "Am I really not making progress?" or "Have I solved some problems I couldn't before?"</li>
                <li><strong>Build Positive Thinking</strong>: Shift focus from "I'm not good enough" to "I'm making progress," documenting achievements to boost confidence.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>2. Goal Setting: The SMART Principle and Small Steps Forward</h5>
            <p>Goal-setting theory suggests that clear goals enhance motivation and performance, but overly ambitious goals can cause stress and anxiety.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SMART Principle</strong>: Apply the SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) when setting problem-solving goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Small Steps Forward</strong>: Break down large goals into smaller ones; each achievement fosters a sense of accomplishment and builds confidence gradually.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>3. Mindfulness Practice: Embracing Uncertainty and Living in the Present</h5>
            <p>Mindfulness is a technique that involves focusing on the present moment, accepting one's emotional and cognitive states to reduce stress and anxiety.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Embrace Uncertainty</strong>: Many problems may not be solvable immediately, which is normal. Mindfulness helps accept this uncertainty.</li>
                <li><strong>Live in the Present</strong>: Concentrate on the current problem rather than worrying about future interviews or others' achievements.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Psychological Techniques to Boost Confidence</h4>
            <h5>1. Self-Efficacy: Building Confidence from Successful Experiences</h5>
            <p>Self-efficacy, a concept by psychologist Albert Bandura, refers to one's belief in their ability to succeed in specific tasks. Accumulating successful experiences is an effective way to enhance self-efficacy in problem-solving.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Document Successes</strong>: Record problem-solving processes and solutions. Reviewing these successes boosts confidence.</li>
                <li><strong>Celebrate Small Wins</strong>: Even solving a medium-difficulty problem is worth celebrating, as each small victory builds confidence.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>2. Growth Mindset: From "I'm Inherently Dumb" to "I Can Improve Through Effort"</h5>
            <p>Growth mindset, proposed by psychologist Carol Dweck, emphasizes that one's potential can develop through effort and learning.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shift Thinking Patterns</strong>: Instead of thinking "I'm inherently dumb," remind yourself, "I can master this problem through effort and learning."</li>
                <li><strong>Embrace Challenges</strong>: Select problems slightly beyond your current ability to experience growth, enhancing confidence through continuous self-improvement.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>3. Community Support: Finding Belonging through Collaboration</h5>
            <p>Humans are social beings, and a sense of belonging is crucial for mental well-being. Joining a study group or finding a learning partner can provide emotional and intellectual support during problem-solving.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Share Experiences</strong>: In a community, share problem-solving experiences and challenges, helping others and gaining new perspectives from feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Encourage Each Other</strong>: Mutual support in the community, especially during tough times, helps individuals feel less alone and reduces anxiety.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>4. Conclusion</h4>
            <p>LeetCode problem-solving is not just a test of algorithmic skills but also a challenge to psychological resilience. Through cognitive restructuring, goal setting, mindfulness practice, and other psychological strategies, we can effectively overcome anxiety and boost confidence. By accumulating successful experiences, cultivating a growth mindset, and seeking community support, we can achieve self-breakthrough during our problem-solving journey and ultimately present our best selves in technical interviews.</p>
