            <h3>Interactions Between Minerals and Microorganisms: Earth's Ecological Balance</h3>
            <p>The relationship between minerals and microorganisms is a key dynamic balance in Earth's ecosystems. Microorganisms promote the weathering of minerals by secreting organic acids, enzymes, and other substances, releasing essential nutrients like potassium, magnesium, and calcium. This process of biological weathering not only affects geological environments but also plays a significant role in biogeochemical cycles. For instance, bacteria and fungi can alter the oxidation state of iron, facilitating the formation of new minerals like hematite. Meanwhile, minerals provide nutrients and habitats for microorganisms, their surface properties such as high specific surface area and adsorption capabilities making them ideal attachment points for microbial biofilms.</p>
            <h4>Roles in Ecosystems</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cycling Processes</strong>: Microorganisms participate in global biogeochemical cycles like nitrogen and sulfur cycles, maintaining Earth's ecological balance.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Remediation</strong>: Interactions between microbes and minerals can reduce heavy metal pollution in the environment, promoting natural recovery.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Technological Applications</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bio-mining</strong>: Using microorganisms to dissolve metals from minerals, making them easier to extract.</li>
