            <h2>OAuth in Decentralized Web: Applications and Challenges</h2>
            <p>In the context of decentralized web, the role of the OAuth protocol has significantly changed. Traditional centralized authorization servers are replaced by decentralized identity management systems, requiring OAuth to adapt to the new technological environment.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cross-chain Interoperability:</strong> Technological differences between different blockchains require OAuth to adapt to multiple underlying technologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication Information in Distributed Storage:</strong> Ensuring the security and privacy of authentication information in distributed ledgers or decentralized storage systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Design of Decentralized Authorization Servers:</strong> Designing a decentralized yet secure authorization server.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By developing cross-chain protocols, leveraging encryption technologies, and decentralized storage protocols such as IPFS, and designing blockchain-based authorization servers, the above challenges can be effectively addressed.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Integration of OAuth with Biometric Technology</h2>
            <p>In the digital age, biometric technologies such as fingerprint recognition, facial recognition, and iris scanning are integrated into the OAuth process, providing an additional layer of security.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Secure Storage and Transmission of Biometric Data:</strong> Ensuring the security of biometric data during storage and transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>Management of False Acceptance Rate:</strong> Reducing the false acceptance rate of biometric technologies while avoiding high false rejection rates.</li>
                <li><strong>Balancing Privacy Protection and Authentication Efficiency:</strong> Enhancing authentication efficiency while ensuring user privacy is fully protected.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To address these challenges, end-to-end encryption technologies can be used to protect the transmission and storage of biometric data, and machine learning algorithms can be utilized to optimize recognition accuracy.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Expansion and Optimization of OAuth in IoT Environments</h2>
            <p>In IoT environments, OAuth's core functions are expanded for authorization between devices. For example, devices in a smart home system can obtain necessary access permissions through OAuth without sharing login credentials.</p>
            <p>IoT devices automatically register and authenticate using pre-configured OAuth client credentials. Once authenticated, devices can obtain the required authorization based on their roles and needs.</p>
            <p>By optimizing protocols, leveraging modern encryption technologies, and establishing a secure monitoring system, issues such as device heterogeneity, network instability, and security threats in IoT environments can be addressed.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The OAuth protocol has shown significant potential in decentralized web, IoT environments, and integration with biometric technologies. By adapting to new technological environments, addressing specific challenges, and combining modern encryption technologies and smart contracts, OAuth can continue to play a crucial role in these areas, providing a solid foundation for building more secure and efficient authentication mechanisms.</p>
