            <h2>The Fusion of Technology and Cultural Heritage: Co-creating Future Legacy</h2>
            <p>In today's era of rapid technological advancement, the preservation and transmission of cultural heritage face unprecedented opportunities and challenges. Technology is not just a symbol of human progress but also an essential tool for the preservation and transmission of cultural heritage. By integrating technology with cultural heritage, we can not only better protect these precious legacies but also create and preserve value for future generations in innovative ways, known as the "future legacy."</p>

            <h3>Digital Technology and Cultural Heritage Preservation</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Digital Archiving and Restoration:</strong> Modern scanning and 3D modeling technologies have made digitalization of artifacts and historical buildings possible. With high-precision laser scanning and 3D printing technology, cultural relics can be accurately replicated and restored. Digital archiving not only preserves the current state of artifacts but also uses virtual restoration techniques to restore their original appearance, leaving valuable materials for posterity. These digitized artifacts will become part of the future legacy for study and appreciation. For example, the Florence Cathedral in Italy used laser scanning technology to digitally recreate its complex dome, preserving this masterpiece of the Renaissance for future generations.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR):</strong> VR and AR technologies provide a revolutionary platform for the presentation of cultural heritage. Visitors can immerse themselves in historical scenes, with ancient cities and lost civilizations coming back to life in virtual worlds. AR technology can make museum exhibits "come alive," offering interactive information through smart devices, enhancing the visitor experience. For instance, the British Museum in the UK uses AR applications to allow visitors to "travel back" to ancient Egypt and witness the construction of the pyramids firsthand. These technologies not only preserve the integrity of cultural heritage but also provide a window into understanding our era for the future.</p>

            <h3>Application of AI and Big Data</h3>
            <p><strong>1. AI in Artifact Authentication and Restoration:</strong> AI, through image recognition and pattern analysis, can help experts quickly authenticate artifacts, analyze their material and age, and suggest restoration strategies. For example, the Van Gogh Museum in the Netherlands uses AI to analyze Van Gogh's paintings to explore his creative process and use of pigments. AI can also monitor the preservation environment of artifacts, providing early warnings for potential damage. These technological innovations will become the foundation of future societal development, ensuring the authenticity and completeness of cultural heritage.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Big Data Analysis:</strong> By collecting and analyzing visitor behavior data, museums and cultural heritage management bodies can understand public interests, adjust exhibition strategies, and optimize resource allocation. Additionally, big data analysis can help researchers uncover connections between historical artifacts, revealing the tracks of cultural exchange. For example, the Palace Museum in Beijing uses visitor data analysis to adjust exhibition content, adding more interactive and educational elements, leaving behind the socio-cultural context of our time for future generations.</p>
