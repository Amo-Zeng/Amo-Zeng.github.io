            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Capitalism, as the dominant global economic model, has undoubtedly achieved remarkable success in driving economic growth and technological innovation. However, its existence is accompanied by a series of complex and profound challenges, including issues related to mental health, environmental sustainability, and social equity. This article will explore these three dimensions in-depth, aiming to reveal the impact of capitalism on them, highlight the existing challenges and potential opportunities, and propose feasible solutions.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Capitalism and Mental Health</h2>
            <h3>Workplace Pressure: The Unavoidable Undertone of Capitalism</h3>
            <p>The capitalist system's extreme emphasis on competition and efficiency has led to increasingly tense workplace atmospheres and rising workplace pressure. Employees often bear high workloads, long working hours, and ever-increasing performance pressures. These pressures not only harm physical health, such as inducing chronic fatigue and cardiovascular diseases, but also have a profound impact on mental health, manifesting in workplace anxiety, depression, and burnout.</p>
            <h3>Definition of Success: The Troubles in Capitalist Values</h3>
            <p>In capitalist values, success is almost equated with the accumulation of wealth, social status, and material enjoyment. This narrow definition of success leads people to focus excessively on external success while neglecting inner satisfaction and happiness. This orientation causes many people to be trapped in endless pursuits and pressures, further exacerbating various mental health issues.</p>
            <h3>Social Comparison: The Invisible Byproduct of Capitalism</h3>
            <p>In capitalist societies, social comparison is particularly prevalent. The widespread use of social media makes it easier for people to compare themselves with others in terms of wealth, status, and lifestyle. This comparison often leads to a decrease in self-evaluation, increasing the risk of anxiety and depression. Social comparison not only undermines individual self-identity but also can lead to unhealthy competition and lifestyles.</p>
            <h3>Strategies to Protect Mental Health</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Corporate Responsibility</strong>: Companies should pay attention to the mental health of their employees, providing flexible work arrangements, psychological counseling services, and employee assistance programs to effectively reduce workplace pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Redefining Success</strong>: Society and individuals should redefine success, focusing more on inner satisfaction and happiness rather than just external achievements.</li>
                <li><strong>Reducing Social Comparison</strong>: Individuals should learn to accept themselves, reduce comparisons with others, and focus on their own growth and development.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintaining Work-Life Balance</strong>: Individuals should rationally plan their time, balancing work and life, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and good interpersonal relationships.</li>
                <li><strong>Mental Health Education</strong>: Strengthen mental health education, raise public awareness and concern about mental health issues, and promote comprehensive improvement in mental health.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Capitalism and Environmental Sustainability</h2>
            <h3>Resource Consumption and Environmental Crisis</h3>
            <p>Capitalist economic growth typically relies heavily on the large-scale consumption of natural resources. Uncontrolled extraction and use of natural resources such as minerals, oil, and forests lead to resource depletion and environmental destruction. For example, coal and oil extraction not only cause land damage and water pollution but also release large amounts of greenhouse gases, exacerbating global climate change. Additionally, waste and pollutants generated by industrial production and consumption activities pose serious threats to ecosystems and human health.</p>
            <h3>The Emergence of the Green Economy</h3>
            <p>Against the backdrop of increasingly prominent environmental crises, the green economy has emerged as a new economic model. The green economy emphasizes achieving both economic growth and environmental protection through sustainable production and consumption methods. For example, the development and use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower not only reduce dependence on fossil fuels but also effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, the circular economy model achieves a double reduction in resource consumption and waste generation through resource recycling and waste reuse.</p>
            <h3>Corporate Responsibility and Sustainable Development</h3>
            <p>In the capitalist system, companies, as key drivers of economic activities, bear significant environmental responsibilities. More and more companies are recognizing that pursuing sustainable development is not only a social responsibility but also a means to gain long-term competitiveness. Companies implement environmental management systems, adopt clean production technologies, and develop eco-friendly products, actively participating in environmental protection and resource conservation. Additionally, companies use social responsibility reports and transparency measures to demonstrate their environmental commitments, enhancing trust and brand influence.</p>
            <h3>Policy Promotion and Regulatory Oversight</h3>
            <p>Governments play an irreplaceable role in promoting environmental sustainability. By formulating and implementing a series of policies and regulations, governments can guide companies and the public towards a green economic transition. For example, carbon trading mechanisms incentivize corporate emission reduction behaviors through market-oriented approaches; environmental taxes and subsidy policies encourage companies to adopt clean technologies and renewable energy. Additionally, governments promote environmental education and public awareness campaigns to raise public awareness of environmental protection and encourage sustainable consumption behaviors.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Capitalism and Social Equity</h2>
            <h3>Wealth Concentration</h3>
            <p>One of the core characteristics of capitalism is the high concentration of wealth. In a market economy, capital and resources often concentrate in the hands of a few, leading to further widening of the wealth gap. According to global wealth reports, the top 1% of the wealthiest population holds more than half of the world's wealth. This wealth concentration not only erodes social equity but also can lead to economic collapse and social unrest.</p>
            <h3>Education and Opportunity</h3>
            <p>The fair distribution of educational resources is considered one of the important means to reduce social inequities. However, in the capitalist system, the issue of unequal distribution of educational resources persists. High-quality educational resources tend to be concentrated in wealthy areas and families, while children in poor areas and families face a shortage of educational resources. This educational inequity fails to effectively break the cycle of poverty and further exacerbates it. Unequal educational opportunities not only limit individual development but also can lead to intergenerational poverty.</p>
            <h3>Tax Policies</h3>
            <p>Tax policies play a key role in regulating social inequities. In the capitalist system, the design of tax policies directly affects the redistribution of wealth. However, in recent years, many countries' tax policies have favored tax cuts, especially for high-income individuals and corporations. While these policies may stimulate economic growth in the short term, they exacerbate wealth concentration and social inequities in the long run. Conversely, if policies can more fairly tax high-income individuals and corporations, and use this revenue for public services and social security, they can alleviate social inequities to some extent.</p>
            <h3>Social Security</h3>
            <p>The social security system plays a positive role in resisting social inequities. In the capitalist system, market competition is full of uncertainties, with issues such as unemployment, illness, and poverty frequently occurring. A comprehensive social security system can provide basic living guarantees for vulnerable groups, reducing their risks in market competition. However, many countries' social security systems are still incomplete, and vulnerable groups face difficult living conditions. Strengthening the social security system and providing unemployment relief, medical insurance, and retirement benefits can effectively reduce social inequities and enhance overall social welfare.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While capitalism accelerates economic growth, it also poses significant challenges to mental health, environmental sustainability, and social equity. However, through measures such as corporate responsibility, redefining success, reducing social comparison, maintaining work-life balance, and mental health education, we can effectively support individual mental health. By promoting the green economy, corporate environmental responsibility, and the implementation of policies and regulations, we can achieve a balance between economic growth and environmental protection. Adjusting tax policies, strengthening the fair distribution of educational resources, and improving the social security system can effectively alleviate social inequities and promote social harmony and stability.</p>
            <p>Only through collective efforts can we find a balance between mental health, environmental sustainability, and social equity within the capitalist system, achieving individual and societal development and sustainability.</p>
