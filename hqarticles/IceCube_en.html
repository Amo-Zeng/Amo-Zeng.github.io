            <h3>Multidisciplinary Integration in Scientific Exploration</h3>
            <h4>1. Physics: Breakthroughs in Neutrino Physics</h4>
            <p>IceCube has advanced the study of neutrino oscillations and masses by capturing cosmic neutrinos, confirming the Standard Model, and exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. Its data helps scientists estimate the upper limits of neutrino masses, significantly impacting particle physics. IceCube's achievements not only expand our understanding of particle properties but also provide a theoretical foundation for future experiments.</p>

            <h4>2. Astronomy: Exploring Sources of Cosmic Rays</h4>
            <p>In the field of astronomy, IceCube detects high-energy neutrino events, identifying neutrino sources from events like supernovae explosions and active galactic nuclei such as TXS 0506+056. This not only enriches multi-messenger astronomy but also provides clues about the origins of cosmic rays. Through integration with other astronomical observation methods, IceCube offers multidimensional cosmic observation data.</p>

            <h4>3. Geology: Study of Ice Cap Dynamics</h4>
            <p>As part of the Antarctic ice cap, IceCube provides geologists with a platform to study ice cap flow, thickness changes, and the impact of climate change on the ice. Its location also makes it an ideal site for ice core and paleoclimate research. By long-term monitoring of the ice cap, scientists can track climate change trends and provide crucial environmental data.</p>

            <h4>4. Computer Science and Data Analysis</h4>
            <p>The vast amounts of data generated by IceCube require advanced computing technologies for processing, including big data analysis and machine learning, which have propelled the development of data science. Complex computer simulations have also advanced computational physics and simulation techniques. IceCube's computing demands have driven innovations in the high-performance computing sector, significantly enhancing scientific computing capabilities.</p>
