            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Traditional trade barriers, like sturdy walls, have long divided the global market into isolated islands, primarily through tariffs and non-tariff measures. However, as the global environmental crisis intensifies and the concept of green development takes root, a new force is quietly emerging, challenging the foundations of the traditional trade system. This force is environmental certification, often referred to as the "green barrier." Environmental certification, like a "green passport," is no longer an optional extra label but a critical threshold that determines whether products can enter certain markets in countries or regions. From the EU's ambitious "Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism" to the upcoming "Clean Competition Act" in the United States, environmental certification is reshaping the global trade landscape with unprecedented force.</p>

            <h2>Environmental Certification: From "Passport" to "New Barrier"</h2>
            <p>The original intention of environmental certification was to promote green production and consumption, reduce environmental pollution, and resource waste. However, as countries increasingly prioritize environmental protection, environmental certification has gradually evolved into a new trade barrier. On one hand, environmental certification standards are becoming more stringent, and the scope of coverage is expanding. From the initial certification of energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products, to the current comprehensive certification system that covers production processes, supply chain management, carbon footprint accounting, and more, the requirements for companies are becoming increasingly high. On the other hand, environmental certification is linked to market access, becoming a necessary condition for products to enter target markets. For example, the EU's "Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism" will impose carbon taxes on high-carbon-emission products, while the U.S. "Clean Competition Act" will charge companies based on their carbon emission intensity. These policies will undoubtedly increase the costs of high-carbon-emission products, making them less competitive in the international market.</p>

            <h2>Enterprises: Responding to "Green Barriers" and Enhancing International Competitiveness</h2>
            <p>Facing increasingly stringent "green barriers," companies must actively respond, turning challenges into opportunities to remain competitive in global trade. First, companies need to enhance environmental awareness and integrate green development理念 into every aspect of production and operation. From product design, raw material selection, process improvement to waste management, companies should actively adopt environmentally friendly technologies and management practices to reduce energy consumption and pollutant emissions. Second, companies need to actively apply for various environmental certifications to obtain the "green passport" for entering target markets. At the same time, companies should closely monitor changes in environmental policies and regulations in target markets and adjust their production and business strategies accordingly. Additionally, companies can enhance their products' added value and competitiveness through technological innovation and industrial upgrading. For example, developing green energy, energy-saving, and environmental protection technologies, and the circular economy, to seize the strategic high ground for future development.</p>

            <h2>The Global Trade Landscape: Deeply Changed by Environmental Certification</h2>
            <p>The rise of environmental certification will have a profound impact on the global trade landscape. First, environmental certification will change the layout of global industrial chains and supply chains. To meet stringent environmental standards, companies will be more inclined to choose environmentally friendly suppliers and partners, driving the global industrial chain towards a greener and more low-carbon direction. Second, environmental certification will exacerbate global trade imbalances. Developed countries with advanced environmental technologies and management experience will gain a greater advantage in international trade, while developing countries will face greater challenges. Finally, environmental certification will promote the reshaping of global trade rules. As environmental certification becomes widespread globally, the international community needs to formulate more unified and fair environmental standards and trade rules to prevent the misuse of green trade barriers and promote the healthy development of global trade.</p>

            <p>Walking into a supermarket, among the myriad products, more and more items adorned with various green labels catch the eye: a leaf, a leaping rabbit, a blue planet... These labels are environmental certification badges, silently conveying the environmental-friendly commitments behind the products. Environmental certification, once an unfamiliar term, is now quietly changing our daily consumption habits, guiding us towards a more sustainable lifestyle.</p>
            <h3>1. Green Labels: Decoding Environmental Certification</h3>
            <p>Environmental certification is not a unified system but a series of standards and labels established by different countries, regions, and industry organizations. Common environmental certification labels include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Food Category:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Organic Certification:</strong> Represents products grown or raised without chemical synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, hormones, and following organic agricultural standards. Examples include the "China Organic Product" label and the EU's "Euroleaf" label.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fair Trade Certification:</strong> Ensures producers receive fair remuneration and commits to environmental and social responsibilities during production. Notable labels include "Fairtrade" and "Max Havelaar."</li>
                    </ul>

            </ul>
            <h3>3. Green Consumption: Lifestyle Guided by Environmental Certification</h3>
            <p>Environmental certification not only provides consumers with a basis for choosing environmentally friendly products but also gradually changes our consumption concepts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>From "Price-Oriented" to "Value-Oriented":</strong> More and more consumers are paying attention to the environmental attributes of products and are willing to pay a premium for more environmentally friendly products, signaling a shift in consumer attitudes.</li>
                <li><strong>From "Individual Behavior" to "Social Consensus":</strong> The popularity of environmentally certified products reflects the increasing social emphasis on environmental protection. Green consumption has become a social consensus.</li>
                <li><strong>From "Passive Acceptance" to "Active Participation":</strong> Consumers are no longer passive information receivers but actively participate in environmental protection. Through their voting rights—consumption choices—they promote companies to fulfill social responsibilities and jointly build a green homeland.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
