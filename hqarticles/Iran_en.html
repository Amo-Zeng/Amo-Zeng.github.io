        <section>
            <p>In recent years, with the rising importance of Central Asia in global historical and geopolitical studies, Iran’s role as the “Central Asia-Persian Corridor” connecting the continents of Eurasia and Africa has drawn renewed attention. This article analyzes Iran’s deep, long-standing role in intercontinental civilizational transmission from the theoretical perspectives of a “hub” and “intermediary civilization.” Drawing from historical systems such as the Royal Road of Ancient Persia, the cross-civilizational knowledge transmission of the Sassanid era, and the trade and cultural exchanges during the Safavid period, this article offers a structured examination of Iran’s historical function as a mediator in global civilizational development. This role influenced not only the Islamic Golden Age and the European Renaissance but also continues to shape contemporary Iran’s strategic identity and geopolitical worldview.</p>

            <h3>Historical Positioning of the “Central Asia-Persian Corridor”</h3>
            <p>The Iranian plateau sits at a natural junction between the continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, making it a historically significant node for transcontinental exchanges. As early as the 6th century BCE, the Persian Empire constructed the Royal Road, a major administrative and trade route stretching over 2,700 kilometers from Susa to Sardis in Asia Minor. Often considered one of the world’s earliest “highways,” it not only enhanced imperial governance but also facilitated the flow of commerce and knowledge across Eurasia.</p>
            <p>The Persian Empire practiced a policy of cultural tolerance and incorporated achievements from Babylon, Egypt, Greece, and India. This openness allowed Persia to function as a bridge for knowledge and technology transfer between East and West.</p>

            <h3>Sassanid Empire: Cross-Civilizational Knowledge Systems</h3>
            <p>From the 3rd to the 7th century CE, the Sassanid Empire became a center of knowledge transmission and inter-civilizational exchange. In its capital of Ctesiphon and other cities, the empire hosted major translation movements, scientific academies, and philosophical schools.</p>
            <p>These institutions served as conduits for Greek, Indian, and Syriac intellectual traditions to reach the Islamic world and later medieval Europe. The Sassanid Empire’s sophisticated bureaucracy and diplomatic networks also helped integrate diverse cultures and trade routes across Eurasia.</p>

            <h3>Safavid Empire: Cultural and Economic Revival</h3>
            <p>During the Safavid dynasty (16th to 18th centuries), Iran experienced a cultural and economic renaissance, becoming a focal point for regional commerce and artistic innovation.</p>
            <p>Isfahan, the capital, became known as “the world’s half” due to its cosmopolitan population, flourishing trade networks, and synthesis of Persian, Turkic, and Islamic traditions. The Safavid state’s strategic location made it a bridge between the Mediterranean, South Asia, and Central Asia, reinforcing Iran’s centuries-old role as a transcontinental hub.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Contemporary Relevance</h3>
            <p>Iran remains a vital geographical and cultural link between Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Its position along ancient trade routes continues to shape its strategic importance in modern global affairs.</p>
            <p>From its role in China’s Belt and Road Initiative to its centrality in Middle Eastern diplomatic negotiations, Iran holds a key position in Eurasian geopolitics. Furthermore, the historical identity of being a “civilizational hub” continues to influence Iran’s national narrative and foreign policy.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Iran is not merely an ancient civilization—it is a historical intermediary that has facilitated exchanges among multiple civilizations for centuries. Recognizing Iran’s historical role as a cultural and intellectual bridge can provide deeper insight into both ancient transcontinental networks and modern geopolitical dynamics.</p>
