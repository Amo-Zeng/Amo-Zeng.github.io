            <h3>Privacy Protection and Transparency: Ethical Challenges and Solutions</h3>
            <h4>Challenges in Privacy Protection</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Misuse and Leaks:</strong> From the Cambridge Analytica scandal to multiple data breaches, the illegal use and leakage of personal data have become focal points of public concern. Lack of transparency and user control are major issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Laws and Regulations:</strong> Laws like GDPR aim to protect privacy, but in practice, they face challenges such as international data flow, the complexity of data processing, and compliance costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy Risks:</strong> Machine learning models might leak sensitive information during training, leading to privacy breaches.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Solutions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Federated Learning:</strong> Train models locally and share only model updates to protect user data privacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Differential Privacy:</strong> Add noise to data to ensure personal information cannot be precisely identified.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Interpretability:</strong> Use algorithms like LIME and SHAP to help users understand model decision-making processes, enhancing transparency.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency Reports:</strong> Companies should publish detailed reports on data usage and privacy protection measures to build public trust.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Minimization and Anonymization:</strong> Collect only necessary data and use technical means to anonymize personal information, reducing privacy risks.</li>
            </ul>
