            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The intensification of global climate change and the ongoing deterioration of the ecological environment have made Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) a crucial tool for protecting biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem health. However, traditional ERA methods have proven inadequate in the face of complex and evolving ecosystems, necessitating innovative technologies and approaches to overcome these challenges. In this context, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) offers revolutionary opportunities for ERA, while the deepening of public participation injects democratic and scientific elements into the assessment process. This article aims to explore the synergy between AI and public participation in addressing new ERA challenges under the backdrop of climate change, and to construct a set of feasible implementation strategies to drive the paradigm shift in ecological risk assessment.</p>

            <h2>Current Situation Analysis</h2>
            <h3>1. Progress in the Application of AI in Ecological Risk Assessment</h3>
            <p>The application of AI in ERA has transitioned from theoretical exploration to practical validation, with its primary application scenarios including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Species Distribution Prediction:</strong> By integrating machine learning algorithms such as random forests, support vector machines, and deep neural networks, AI can simulate species distribution patterns under future climate change based on historical climate and ecological data. This not only helps identify priority areas for protecting endangered species but also provides early warning against invasive species.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecosystem Services Assessment:</strong> AI technologies integrate remote sensing, meteorological, and socio-economic data to quantify the temporal and spatial changes of ecosystem services. For example, deep learning-based forest carbon stock estimation has become an important basis for carbon trading and climate policy-making.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Disaster Warning and Response:</strong> AI models analyze historical disaster data and real-time monitoring information to build predictive frameworks for disaster occurrence probabilities and impact ranges. For instance, reinforcement learning-based hydrological models can simulate complex water cycle processes, providing dynamic decision support for flood prevention and mitigation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. The Role of Public Participation in Ecological Risk Assessment</h3>
            <p>The importance of public participation in ERA has become increasingly prominent, with its main contributions including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Assessment Transparency and Credibility:</strong> Public participation makes the assessment process more transparent, enhancing the credibility and social acceptance of the results.</li>
                <li><strong>Facilitating Stakeholder Consultation and Consensus Building:</strong> Public participation provides a multi-lateral dialogue platform for governments, enterprises, communities, and environmental organizations, effectively reducing potential conflicts during the assessment process.</li>
                <li><strong>Stimulating Public Environmental Awareness and Action:</strong> By participating in the assessment, the public can gain a deeper understanding of the vulnerability of ecosystems, thereby actively engaging in environmental protection practices.</li>
            </ul>
