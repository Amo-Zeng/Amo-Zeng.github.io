            <h2>Opportunities and Challenges of the Big Data Era</h2>
            <p>Once seen as a collection of cold numbers, big data is now reshaping our society and economy in unprecedented ways. It not only drives technological progress but also demonstrates its potential for "humanization" in various fields such as social, economic, and educational domains. At the same time, the widespread application of big data brings a series of challenges, particularly in privacy protection and data security. However, it is in this environment of coexisting opportunities and challenges that big data empowers traditional industries to upgrade and transforms them, opening the blueprint for a future of intelligent society.</p>
