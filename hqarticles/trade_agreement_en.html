            <p>In the era of globalization, trade agreements have transcended traditional tariff reductions and market access, evolving into strategic tools for reshaping the global economic order. Under the challenges of supply chain reconstruction, the rise of digital trade, and the intensification of the climate crisis, trade agreements exert a profound influence, deeply shaping the future of the global economy.

            <h3>I. Supply Chain Reconstruction: From Cost Competition to Strategic Game</h3>
            <p>For a long time, global supply chains have been guided by cost efficiency, with enterprises dispersing production processes to regions with the lowest labor costs to maximize profits. However, in recent years, frequent trade frictions, escalating geopolitical risks, and the impact of the pandemic have exposed the fragility of this model. In this context, trade agreements become important tools for economic cooperation among nations, providing businesses with opportunities to re-examine their supply chain layouts, allowing them to move beyond mere price considerations and plan from a broader strategic level.</p>

Cross-border data flows have driven the booming development of global economic trade but have also triggered conflicts between data flow and sovereignty protection.
