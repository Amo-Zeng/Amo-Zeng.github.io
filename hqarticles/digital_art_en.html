            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of digital technology, the boundaries of artistic creation and social expression are undergoing unprecedented reshaping. Digital art, as an emerging form that transcends physical limitations, not only breaks the material constraints of traditional art but also profoundly challenges our understanding of the essence of reality in the intersection of virtual and real worlds. The dissemination and interactivity of digital art make it an important tool for social movements, political expressions, and cultural reflection. However, with the advancement of technology, digital art also faces significant ethical challenges in its creation and presentation processes. This article will explore the profound impact of digital art from three dimensions: the redefinition of reality by digital art, the reshaping of social expression, and the ethical dilemmas faced by digital art.</p>

            <h2>Breaking Virtual Boundaries: How Digital Art Redefines the Essence of Reality</h2>
            <p>The rise of digital art marks the beginning of a new dimension in artistic creation. Traditional art relies on the material attributes of the physical world, while digital technology completely breaks this limitation. Through computer-generated imagery (CGI), 3D modeling, and virtual reality (VR), artists can create a completely virtual world where objects, scenes, and beings can transcend natural physical laws and exhibit limitless free forms.</p>
            <p>For example, the work "Everydays: The First 5000 Days" by American artist Beeple, constructed using digital tools, challenges the formal and material constraints of traditional art and blurs the boundaries between art and reality. This creative approach allows art to no longer merely be a visual presentation but an immersive experience. Through VR devices, viewers can directly enter the virtual space created by the artist, interact with the environment, and even become part of the artwork. The work "PeopleTracker" by artist Lauren Lee McCarthy uses data tracking technology to link the virtual behavior of viewers with their real identities, further blurring the boundaries between virtual and reality, leading to profound reflections on privacy, identity, and digital ethics.</p>
            <p>The virtual nature of digital art is not a simple transcendence of reality but a redefinition of reality. Through code and algorithms, artists can manipulate fundamental elements such as light, matter, and space to create a new mode of perception. This creative approach not only changes our perception of art but also redefines the concept of "real." As French philosopher Jean Baudrillard once said, when technology can create a virtual world that is "more real" than reality, our perception and understanding of reality will also change accordingly.</p>

            <h2>Digital Social Expression: The Clash of Art and Ethics</h2>
            <p>The dissemination and interactivity of digital art make it an important tool for social movements and political expression. During the "Arab Spring" and the #MeToo movement, digital art used intuitive and striking visual language to expose social injustices and power oppression, triggering global attention and discussions. However, with the widespread application of digital art in social movements, its ethical issues have gradually surfaced.</p>
            <p>First, the openness and anonymity of digital platforms provide fertile ground for art plagiarism and secondary creation. The unauthorized alteration and appropriation of works not only infringe on the intellectual property rights of original artists but also undermine the moral legitimacy of social movements. Second, the rapid dissemination of digital art may lead to information distortion and public misunderstanding. For example, during the #MeToo movement, some digital artworks were taken out of context or maliciously manipulated, causing unnecessary controversies and undermining the original intention of the movement.</p>
            <p>In political expression, digital art provides artists with a broader stage. During the 2020 U.S. presidential election, digital artists used satirical cartoons and dynamic images to sharply criticize the statements and policies of political figures, resonating widely. However, the anonymity and concealment of digital art also provide possibilities for the spread of false information. Some political images and videos may be forged to incite public emotions and create social unrest. Finding a balance between criticism and respect has become an ethical issue that artists and the public must confront.</p>
            <p>Digital art is not only a reflection of society and politics but also a profound contemplation of human culture. In the post-human era, digital artists use virtual reality and artificial intelligence technology to explore the impact of technology on human identity and ethics. However, this cultural reflection also brings new challenges. Some artists overly rely on new technologies, neglecting the inheritance and protection of traditional art forms, leading to a reduction in cultural diversity. Additionally, the creation of virtual images may offend or harm certain cultural groups. Finding a balance between innovation and respect has become an ethical dilemma that digital art creators must face.</p>

            <h2>Addressing Ethical Dilemmas: The Integrity and Moral Use of Digital Art</h2>
            <p>Facing the ethical dilemmas in the creation and presentation of digital art, we need to adopt multifaceted measures. First, artists should strengthen their awareness of intellectual property protection to avoid art plagiarism and unethical secondary creation. Second, digital platforms should strengthen the review and supervision of false information to avoid the adverse effects of false artworks on society. Additionally, artists should maintain respect for others and cultures in political expression and cultural reflection to avoid excessive criticism and offense.</p>
            <p>As participants in the experience of digital art, audiences should also maintain a clear awareness and critical thinking to avoid being misled by false information and malicious manipulation. Only through the joint efforts of artists, audiences, and the entire art community can we ensure that the ethical bottom line of digital art is not breached and promote its healthy development.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The rise of digital art is not only the product of technological progress but also the inevitable result of social development and cultural change. Through the intersection of virtual and reality, artists redefine the boundaries of reality and perception, providing new possibilities for social movements, political expression, and cultural reflection. However, while digital art creates endless possibilities, it also brings profound ethical challenges. Finding a balance between innovation and morality is not only a challenge for artistic creation but also a profound reflection on social responsibility.</p>
            <p>In the future, digital art may further blur the boundaries between virtual and reality, creating a new mode of perception. In this process, our understanding of art, society, and self will also become more diverse and complex. The ultimate goal of digital art may not be to transcend reality but to redefine and expand our understanding and perception of reality through virtual means.</p>
