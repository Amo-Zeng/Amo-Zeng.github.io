        <h2>A Deep Crisis of Meaning, Visibility, and the Future</h2>

        <section>
            <p>In 2024, global unemployment surpassed <span class="stat">200 million</span>, but a more insidious statistic is emerging: <span class="stat">43%</span> of the unemployed report that "<strong>losing a job means losing life's purpose</strong>" (Pew Research Center, 2023). Meanwhile, an Uber driver—penalized by algorithmic downgrading—received no ride requests for 30 consecutive days, yet remained uncounted in any unemployment statistics. A psychological experiment reveals that long-term unemployed individuals score <span class="stat">47%</span> lower in "<strong>future imagination capacity</strong>" than their employed counterparts.</p>
            <p>This unveils a truth long ignored by mainstream narratives: <strong>contemporary unemployment is no longer merely 'joblessness.'</strong> It is the collapse of modernity's promises, the restructuring of technological power, and the dysfunction of human cognition—a <strong>syndrome of triple fracture.</strong></p>

            <h2>I. Fracture of Social Structure: The Erosion of Occupational Sacredness and the Crisis of Meaning</h2>
            <p>Max Weber, in *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism*, argued that <strong>labor is a "calling" (Beruf)</strong>—not merely a means of survival, but a way for individuals to prove their worth to God. This idea was secularized under modern capitalism: work became the sole legitimate path to "self-realization." "You are what you do"—this modern adage embodies the sacredness of occupation. Doctors save lives, teachers enlighten minds, engineers build futures; professions carry symbolic value beyond economic return.</p>
            <p>Yet this sacredness is systematically eroding. Automation, platform economies, and algorithmic management have transformed labor from "mission" into "task." Food delivery riders are capped by speed algorithms, ride-share drivers controlled by ratings, short-form video creators dictated by traffic algorithms. They "work," yet <strong>are not recognized as "professionals."</strong> As Zygmunt Bauman writes in *Liquid Modernity*, society has shifted from "solid" to "liquid": occupation is no longer a stable identity, but a disposable "toolkit." When professions lose long-term commitment, their meaning evaporates.</p>
            <p>Worse still, <strong>de-professionalization</strong> is spreading: AI replaces routine cognitive labor (e.g., basic copywriting, accounting); career lifespans shrink (the "35-year-old crisis" for programmers, burnout among teachers); identities fragment ("slash youth" reflects the disintegration of occupational identity). We are no longer "unemployed," but <strong>perpetually adrift in occupational uncertainty.</strong> Unemployment is no longer an "exceptional state," but the daily reality of liquid modernity.</p>
            <p>When work becomes the sole source of value, society falls into <strong>workism</strong>—an ideology that sanctifies labor. It proclaims: <strong>not working means not being worth existing.</strong> It enforces psychological violence through moral judgment ("lying flat = laziness"), value monopolization (success = high-paying job), and self-exploitation ("996 is a blessing"). Pew Research shows <span class="stat">57%</span> of the unemployed suffer depression due to "loss of self-worth," far exceeding financial stress (<span class="stat">32%</span>). "Hustle culture" and "lying flat" appear opposite, but are two poles of the same logic: <strong>when work fails to provide meaning, people either over-invest or completely withdraw.</strong></p>
            <p>The solution is not "more jobs," but <strong>rebuilding non-occupational value systems.</strong> Charles Taylor, in *A Secular Age*, observes: when transcendent meaning vanishes, humans must find new "containers of meaning." We must turn to <strong>subjective practices:</strong> civic engagement (community councils, volunteering), ecological action (low-carbon living, urban farming), digital creation (writing, coding, film), and relational value (family, friendship, community). These practices rely not on employment, but on <strong>autonomy and connection</strong>—you don't need to be hired to be meaningful.</p>

            <h2>II. Technological Fracture: Algorithmic Governance and the Denial of Labor Visibility</h2>
            <p>As social meaning fractures, technological systems intensify the crisis. "You're unemployed, but the system doesn't know."—This is not a technical glitch, but the <strong>inevitable outcome of algorithmic governance.</strong> "Labor visibility"—the degree to which individual labor is recognized, recorded, and acknowledged by social systems—is becoming a key right in the digital age.</p>
            <p>Traditional unemployed individuals, though jobless, are at least "visible": they register for jobs, receive welfare, and are counted in statistics. But gig workers differ: their labor is recorded by platforms, yet their <strong>unemployment status is ignored by the system.</strong> As technology philosopher Langdon Winner notes: <strong>technology is not just a tool, but a power apparatus.</strong> Algorithms, through "matching," "rating," and "scheduling," decide "who is seen" and "who is ignored." In gig platforms, algorithms function as an <strong>invisible court of labor governance</strong>: determining who gets more orders, who is downgraded; defining "high-quality workers," excluding "inefficient users"; tracking labor trails, yet denying labor relationships.</p>
            <p>When algorithms de-personalize workers into data points, their labor is captured by platforms, yet their <strong>unemployment is rendered invisible</strong>—this is what Nick Couldry calls <strong>data colonialism:</strong> platforms extract data for labor control while rejecting social responsibility.</p>
            <blockquote>
                The formation of the "digital unemployment black hole" relies on three mechanisms:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Algorithmic bias:</strong> Platforms use historical data, geography, and behavior patterns to filter users, systematically excluding low-skilled workers and those in remote areas. Example: Food delivery riders with "order acceptance rates" below a threshold are automatically downgraded, reducing orders and creating "algorithmic unemployment." Research shows <span class="stat">30%</span> of riders on one platform are in "invisible unemployment" (no orders for over 40% of time), yet uncounted in any system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Platform identity denial:</strong> Platforms classify workers as "independent contractors," rejecting "employee" status. Uber has faced global lawsuits over "bogus self-employment," but court rulings are slow, leaving workers unprotected. China's *Guidelines on Protecting New-Form Employment Workers* exist, but enforcement is weak; platforms evade responsibility through "contractual loopholes."</li>
                    <li><strong>Official statistical blind spots:</strong> Unemployment statistics require both "active job search" and "no work." Gig workers, even with no orders, are considered "employed" due to "platform online" status, leading to <strong>massive "invisible unemployment" unrecorded.</strong> The ILO notes that <span class="stat">over 40%</span> of informal workers are in "precarious employment," nearly unemployed, but without data.</li>
                </ul>
            </blockquote>
            <p>An extreme case: <strong>AI training data annotators.</strong> They label images, text, and speech—the "invisible brain" of AI. Yet their labor is fully "de-visible": their outputs are absorbed by AI, making them obsolete; platforms outsource tasks to global low-cost labor, replacing them arbitrarily; they lack contracts, professional identity, or unemployment records. When AI matures, they are "optimized out"—yet <strong>were never "seen" by the system.</strong> They are not unemployed; they <strong>were never acknowledged to exist.</strong></p>
            <p>"Labor visibility" should be recognized as a new human right dimension—<strong>a "digital right to existence."</strong> To achieve this, we must:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic transparency:</strong> Platforms must disclose matching logic, downgrade rules, and rating criteria;</li>
                <li><strong>Digital unemployment registry:</strong> Establish independent platforms to record gig workers' "no-order periods" and "declining acceptance rates";</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic audits:</strong> Third parties should assess platforms for "labor fairness";</li>
                <li><strong>Digital worker identity legislation:</strong> Create a new "platform worker" status, granting unemployment benefits, social security, and collective bargaining rights.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>III. Psychological Fracture: The Collapse of Future Imagination and Cognitive Trauma</h2>
            <p>As social meaning fractures and technological power denies visibility, individual cognition undergoes deep restructuring. A 2022 psychological study of 500 long-term unemployed individuals revealed: <strong>their "future imagination capacity" scored <span class="stat">47%</span> lower than the employed.</strong> They could describe the past clearly, but failed to construct "possible futures." This is not emotional—it is <strong>deep cognitive restructuring.</strong> Long-term unemployment is killing a vital ability: <strong>future imagination.</strong></p>
            <p>Psychologist Philip Zimbardo's "time perspective theory" shows that mental health depends on <strong>future orientation</strong>—the sense of planning, hope, and possibility. Employed individuals often have "possible selves": "I will be promoted," "I can transition." These imaginations precede action.</p>
            <p>But long-term unemployment, after repeated failure, closes this mental channel. Neuroimaging shows <strong>reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)</strong>, responsible for abstract reasoning, goal-setting, and future simulation. Andy Clark's "predictive processing model" explains the mechanism: the brain uses "future prediction" to guide present behavior. When predictions consistently fail, the brain enters "energy-saving mode," reducing prediction attempts—not laziness, but <strong>adaptive cognitive freezing.</strong></p>
            <p>Worse, the world changes faster than psychological adaptation. Alvin Toffler, in *Future Shock*, warned: when societal change outpaces psychological adjustment, people experience "future shock"—fear of uncertainty overwhelms agency.</p>
            <p>Today, AI displacement, career reconfiguration, and climate crises—"black swan" events—make the future unpredictable. Psychological studies show:
            <ul>
                <li>The unemployed can imagine only <span class="stat">38%</span> as many "possible future jobs" as the employed;</li>
                <li><span class="stat">82%</span> of long-term unemployed report "fear of the future," far exceeding "fear of poverty" (<span class="stat">56%</span>);</li>
                <li>"Future fear" is strongly linked to depression and anxiety.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Long-term unemployment breeds <strong>psychological time trauma:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Distorted time perception:</strong> Unemployed report "time slowing down," "daily repetition," lacking "forward momentum";</li>
                <li><strong>Self-identity collapse:</strong> "I don't know who I am" is a common statement;</li>
                <li><strong>Motivational paralysis:</strong> Even with training, people abandon it due to "inability to imagine outcomes."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The solution is not "skill training," but <strong>future literacy</strong>—rebuilding the capacity to imagine the future:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Narrative therapy:</strong> Guide the unemployed to write "possible future stories";</li>
                <li><strong>Scenario planning:</strong> Provide multiple future visions to build "adaptive selves";</li>
                <li><strong>Gamified simulation:</strong> Use VR or board games to simulate career transitions, restoring "future control";</li>
                <li><strong>Future workshops:</strong> Organize "future exploration" groups to rebuild social connection through collective imagination.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A Norwegian pilot project showed that after "future literacy" programs, unemployed individuals' future imagination scores rose <span class="stat">61%</span>, and job search motivation increased <span class="stat">45%</span> within six months.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Triple Repair of Unemployment and the Possibility of a Post-Work Society</h2>
            <p>Unemployment is no longer "joblessness." It is <strong>the triple fracture of modernity, technology, and human cognition.</strong> We must stop asking: "How do you make a living?" and start asking: "<strong>Why do you live? Are you seen by the system? Can you still imagine the future?</strong>"</p>
            <p>The path forward lies in a framework of <strong>triple repair of unemployment</strong>:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Meaning repair:</strong> Rebuild non-occupational value systems, dismantle workism, promote civic engagement, ecological action, digital creation, and relational value;</li>
                <li><strong>Visibility repair:</strong> Recognize "labor visibility" as a human right, establish algorithmic transparency, digital unemployment registries, and platform worker identity legislation;</li>
                <li><strong>Time repair:</strong> Promote "future literacy" through narrative therapy, scenario planning, and gamified simulation, restoring psychological time and "possible selves."</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In the post-work era, true freedom is not "having a job," but <strong>the courage to choose not to work,</strong> and the ability to <strong>live fully without work.</strong> When meaning, visibility, and future agency are restored, we may emerge from the triple fracture toward a more just, humane, and hopeful future.</p>
