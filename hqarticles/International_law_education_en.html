            <h3>1. The Importance of International Law Education in Modern Society</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Addressing Global Challenges</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Challenges such as climate change, terrorism, cybersecurity, and public health brought by globalization require cooperation among nations based on respect for sovereignty. International law provides norms and tools for this. For example, the Paris Agreement establishes a legal framework for countries to commit to emissions reduction targets, while the World Health Organization coordinates global pandemic response under the International Health Regulations. International law education helps students understand these frameworks and develop problem-solving skills.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Maintaining International Order</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>International law is a crucial safeguard for world peace and security. Through international law education, students can deeply understand the principles and mechanisms of international law, enhancing their sense of responsibility in maintaining international order. For instance, the International Court of Justice resolves disputes between nations based on the UN Charter, effectively preventing conflicts from escalating. International law education not only improves understanding of international rules but also promotes global peace and stability.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Promoting International Exchange and Cooperation</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>International law education cultivates students' global perspective and cross-cultural communication skills, enabling them to safeguard national interests and promote cooperation on the international stage. For example, China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) facilitated its integration into the global trade system and enhanced its international influence. The spread of international law education has promoted mutual trust and cooperation among nations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>2. The Impact of International Law Education on National Foreign Policy</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cultivating Diplomatic Talent Familiar with International Rules</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>International law education provides legal support for national foreign policy. For example, the United States, by training numerous international law experts, has dominated the WTO dispute resolution mechanism, safeguarding its economic interests. These professionals provide legal foundations for the formulation and implementation of foreign policy.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Shaping Policy Ideals</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>International law education helps policymakers establish a sense of rules, ensuring that foreign policies align with international law. For instance, the EU's promotion of the Global Compact has enhanced its influence in the field of international human rights, strengthening the legitimacy and international support of its policies.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Providing Legal Support</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>International law education trains legal experts for diplomatic departments, who provide legal advice for diplomatic decision-making and help the nation gain advantageous positions in disputes. For example, India's accession to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) enhanced its voice in regional cooperation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Promoting International Cooperation</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>International law education enhances diplomats' negotiation skills and legal literacy, helping them safeguard national interests in international cooperation. For instance, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) strengthened legal frameworks to promote regional economic cooperation and political stability.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>3. Innovative Methods and Future Trends in International Law Education</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Integration</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>International law is closely related to economics, political science, environmental science, and other fields. For example, Harvard University's international law courses integrate political science and environmental science, cultivating interdisciplinary talents. This teaching model helps students comprehensively understand the practical value of international law.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Case-Based Teaching Methods</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analyzing classic cases allows students to better understand the theory and practice of international law. For example, Yale University's simulated international court helps students enhance practical skills. In the future, case-based teaching will focus more on the simulation of real-world scenarios.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Practical Opportunities</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mock trials and internships at international organizations provide students with practical experience. For example, internships at the International Criminal Court allow students to participate in real international judicial practices, enhancing their global perspective and practical skills.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Online Education and Transnational Collaboration</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Online education breaks geographical barriers, promoting the spread of international law education. For example, MIT's online courses attract students worldwide. Transnational cooperation facilitates the sharing of high-quality resources, advancing the globalization of international law education.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Technological Empowerment</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality provide new tools for international law education. For example, Stanford University uses virtual reality to simulate international court scenarios, allowing students to experience the practical application of international law, enhancing teaching effectiveness.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
