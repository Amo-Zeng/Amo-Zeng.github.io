            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Claude Lévi-Strauss (1908-2009) is one of the most important sociologists and anthropologists of the 20th century, and his structuralist theory has had a profound impact on the social sciences. With the rise of digital humanities, the development of environmental ethics, and the acceleration of globalization, Lévi-Strauss's theories have been reinterpreted and applied in new technological and social contexts. This article will explore how Lévi-Strauss's structuralism can play a new role in the fields of digital humanities, environmental ethics, and the homogenization of global culture, bringing new perspectives and methods to cultural studies and social sciences.</p>

            <h2>Lévi-Strauss's Structuralism</h2>
            <p>Lévi-Strauss's structuralist theory primarily focuses on the deep structures underlying cultural phenomena. He believed that cultural phenomena do not exist in isolation but are part of a system composed of a series of interconnected symbols and rules. By analyzing these symbols and rules, the essence and meaning of cultural phenomena can be revealed. Lévi-Strauss's theory has been widely applied in fields such as linguistics, mythology, and kinship. His theory of binary oppositions, such as life and death, nature and culture, and male and female, not only exists in language and symbolic systems but also permeates social structures and cultural practices.</p>

            <h2>Digital Humanities and Lévi-Strauss's Structuralism</h2>
            <h3>Data Mining and Symbolic Analysis</h3>
            <p>Lévi-Strauss's structuralism emphasizes the analysis of cultural symbols. In the context of digital humanities, data mining techniques can be used to collect and analyze cultural symbols on a large scale. For example, web crawling technology can be used to collect large amounts of text, image, and video data, which can then be processed using natural language processing and image recognition technologies to extract symbolic information. This symbolic information can be further used for structural analysis to reveal the deep structures underlying cultural phenomena.</p>
            <h3>Text Analysis and Mythological Studies</h3>
            <p>Lévi-Strauss introduced the concept of "mythology" in his studies of mythology, arguing that myths convey cultural meanings through a series of symbols and structures. Text analysis techniques in digital humanities can be used to analyze mythological texts on a large scale, extracting keywords, themes, and structures. Through these analyses, researchers can gain a more systematic understanding of mythological stories in different cultures, revealing their commonalities and differences.</p>
            <h3>Network Analysis and Kinship Studies</h3>
            <p>Lévi-Strauss introduced the concept of "kinship structure" in his studies of kinship, arguing that kinship is organized through a series of rules and patterns. Network analysis techniques in digital humanities can be used to construct and analyze kinship networks. By analyzing the nodes and edges in the network, researchers can reveal the structural characteristics of kinship and gain a deeper understanding of kinship patterns in different cultures.</p>
            <h3>Visualization and Cultural Comparison</h3>
            <p>Lévi-Strauss's structuralism emphasizes comparative studies across cultures. Visualization techniques in digital humanities can be used to present data from different cultures in graphical form, allowing researchers to intuitively compare the similarities and differences between cultures. Through visualization, researchers can more easily identify the structural characteristics underlying cultural phenomena, leading to new theoretical hypotheses.</p>

            <h2>Lévi-Strauss and Environmental Ethics</h2>
            <h3>The Relationship Between Humans and Nature</h3>
            <p>In Lévi-Strauss's theory, the relationship between humans and nature is a significant theme. He believed that many cultural phenomena in human societies can be traced back to the perception and classification of the natural world. For example, in *The Savage Mind* (*La Pensée Sauvage*), he explored how primitive societies understand the order of the natural world through classification systems. These classification systems not only reflect human perceptions of nature but also illustrate the ways in which humans interact with nature.</p>
            <h3>A Perspective on Environmental Ethics</h3>
            <p>Environmental ethics focuses on how humans should morally treat the natural environment and how to establish a sustainable relationship between humans and nature. Lévi-Strauss's theory provides a unique perspective on environmental ethics. First, his theory of binary oppositions can help us understand the tension between humans and nature. For example, modern industrial societies often view nature as a provider of resources, which leads to environmental degradation and ecological crises.</p>
            <p>Second, Lévi-Strauss's studies of primitive societies reveal a more harmonious relationship between humans and nature.
