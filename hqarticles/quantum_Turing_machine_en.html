            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the field of computational science, quantum computing and classical computing each demonstrate unique and complementary strengths. Quantum computing leverages the superposition and entanglement properties of qubits to theoretically process vast amounts of data in parallel, tackling complex problems that are intractable for classical computing. However, quantum computing faces technical challenges like quantum error correction and decoherence. In contrast, classical computing is noted for its stability, interpretability, and mature technological support. Integrating these two computational models into a hybrid computing model is not only at the forefront of current research but also forms the foundation of future computing technology.</p>

            <h3>Architectural Design of Hybrid Computing Models</h3>
            <h4>Basic Architecture:</h4>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Quantum Computing Layer:</strong> Focuses on executing quantum algorithms, quantum gate operations, and other quantum computing tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Interface Layer:</strong> Acts as the bridge between classical and quantum computing, managing data conversion, state synchronization, and execution environment coordination.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Data Flow and Control Flow:</h4>
            <p>Data flows from the classical layer into the interface layer, undergoes a quantum-classical conversion mechanism to enter the quantum layer, and after execution, returns through the interface layer to the classical layer. The control flow is determined by the classical control layer, dynamically adjusting the priority and execution order of tasks in the quantum layer through algorithms and strategies.</p>
            <h4>Combination of Quantum Error Correction and Classical Error Correction:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Using classical error correction algorithms to assist quantum error correction, reducing the error rate in quantum computing.</li>
