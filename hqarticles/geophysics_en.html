            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Earthquakes, as natural phenomena of energy release from within the Earth, have waves that not only profoundly affect surface structures but also reveal dynamic changes within the Earth. Traditionally, seismic waves were thought to propagate linearly, but with deeper research, their nonlinear characteristics in high-intensity or complex media have been discovered. With advances in computational capabilities and data acquisition technology, scientists have started using multiscale simulation methods to understand the complex dynamic behaviors of the Earth. Concurrently, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in geophysical data interpretation has become increasingly widespread, providing new perspectives and methods for understanding and predicting geological phenomena. This article aims to comprehensively explore the phenomena and mechanisms of nonlinear seismic wave propagation, multiscale geodynamic modeling, and the application of AI within these fields.</p>

            <h3>Nonlinear Propagation of Seismic Waves</h3>
            <p>In seismology, nonlinear propagation refers to the phenomenon where seismic waves change in form, frequency, etc., due to the nonlinear effects of the medium during propagation. This mainly manifests as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Material Nonlinearity:</strong> Changes in elastic modulus of rocks and soil under strong seismic waves, leading to changes in wave speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Geometric Nonlinearity:</strong> Nonlinear effects caused by scattering and reflection of waves in heterogeneous media.</li>
                <li><strong>Nonlinear Scattering:</strong> Interaction caused by nonlinear scattering centers along the propagation path of seismic waves.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These nonlinear effects produce phenomena like waveform distortion, harmonic generation, and changes in wave speed, which are significant for understanding seismic hazards, subsurface resource exploration, and earthquake-resistant design.</p>

            <h3>Multiscale Geodynamic Modeling</h3>
            <p>Geodynamic research covers from the microscale of atomic structures to the macroscale of plate movements, involving simulations at different scales:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microscale:</strong> Using molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics to study the behavior of minerals under high temperature and pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Mesoscale:</strong> Understanding rock deformation and failure through finite element analysis and discrete element simulations.</li>
                <li><strong>Macroscale:</strong> Simulating plate tectonic movements and the impact of global climate change on geological processes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Challenges in multiscale modeling include scale coupling, computational resource limitations, and data integration, but its potential is vast, capable of revealing the Earth's evolutionary history and predicting natural disasters.</p>

            <h3>AI in Geophysical Data Interpretation</h3>
            <p>AI technologies have shown significant advantages in handling and interpreting geophysical data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Seismic Data Processing:</strong> AI for noise reduction, seismic inversion, and automated interpretation, enhancing data quality and efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Electromagnetic Data Interpretation:</strong> Enhancing inversion accuracy through optimization algorithms, identifying subsurface resources and geological structure changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Gravity and Magnetic Data:</strong> Pre-processing and automatic structure recognition, reducing human intervention.</li>
                <li><strong>Remote Sensing Data:</strong> AI through image recognition and change detection to monitor geological changes and predict disasters.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite AI showing great potential in geophysical data interpretation, it still faces challenges regarding data quality, computational resources, and model interpretability.</p>
