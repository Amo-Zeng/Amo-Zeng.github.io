            <h2>Digitalization, Sustainability, and Transnational Cooperation: Reshaping the New Paradigm of Industrial Economics</h2>
            <p>Against the backdrop of profound changes in the global economic landscape, industrial economics is undergoing an unprecedented theoretical and practical reconstruction. This transformation is driven not only by rapid technological advances but also by the dual forces of sustainability and the globalization process. Digital transformation, sustainability, and the deepening of transnational cooperation are redefining the boundaries of industrial economics research, propelling it towards a more comprehensive, dynamic, and global theoretical system. This article will explore the future development directions of industrial economics from these three dimensions and attempt to construct a new framework for industrial economics that integrates digitalization, sustainability, and transnational cooperation, in order to address the complex challenges of the global economy.</p>

            <h3>1. Digital Transformation: The Technological Revolution in Industrial Economics</h3>
            <p>Digital transformation is one of the core driving forces behind the current changes in industrial economics. The widespread application of digital technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and blockchain is profoundly reshaping the theoretical foundations and business practices of industrial economics.</p>
            <h4>1.1 Digital Technologies Reshaping the Theoretical Foundations of Industrial Economics</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application of Big Data:</strong> The prevalence of big data technology enables companies to extract insights from full datasets, rather than relying on sample data.</li>
                <li><strong>Introduction of Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Artificial intelligence drives industrial economics from static models to dynamic predictions.</li>
                <li><strong>Innovations in Blockchain:</strong> Blockchain provides new solutions for trust mechanisms in industrial economics.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.2 Digital Transformation Empowering Business Efficiency and Model Innovation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>From Automation to Intelligence:</strong> Through IoT and Industrial Internet technologies, companies achieve real-time interconnection of production equipment.</li>
                <li><strong>From Product-Oriented to Service-Oriented:</strong> Digital transformation prompts companies to shift from traditional "product-oriented" to "service-oriented" approaches.</li>
                <li><strong>Data-Driven Decision Optimization:</strong> Digital transformation allows companies to optimize decisions based on massive data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Sustainability: The Green Revolution in Industrial Economics</h3>
            <p>Against the backdrop of increasingly severe global environmental issues, sustainability has become a core issue in the study of industrial economics. Green manufacturing, circular economy, and carbon neutrality goals are driving a green revolution in industrial economics.</p>
            <h4>2.1 The Industrial Economics Implications of Green Manufacturing and Circular Economy</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Green Manufacturing:</strong> Green manufacturing emphasizes minimizing environmental impacts throughout all stages of the product lifecycle.</li>
                <li><strong>Circular Economy:</strong> The circular economy achieves efficient resource utilization through closed-loop resource flow.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.2 Industrial Structure Adjustment and Industrial Upgrading Under Carbon Neutrality Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low-Carbon Transformation of Traditional High-Carbon Industries:</strong> Traditional high-carbon industries are undergoing low-carbon transformation through the replacement of fossil fuels with clean energy and improving energy efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Development of Emerging Low-Carbon Industries:</strong> Emerging low-carbon industries such as renewable energy and electric vehicles will see rapid growth opportunities.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>3. Transnational Cooperation: The Globalization Reshaping of Industrial Economics</h3>
            <p>In the context of globalization, transnational cooperation has become an important dimension of industrial economics research. The reconstruction of transnational industrial chains, regional economic integration, and the Belt and Road Initiative are redefining the trajectory of industrial economics development.</p>
            <h4>3.1 Reconstruction of Transnational Industrial Chains: A New Global Division of Labor</h4>
            <p>The traditional vertically integrated production model is gradually being broken, replaced by a global division of labor system tied to value chains.</p>
            <h4>3.2 Regional Economic Integration: Industrial Division Under the RCEP Framework</h4>
            <p>Regional economic integration, such as the signing of RCEP, provides a new institutional framework for industrial division and industrial agglomeration within the region.</p>
            <h4>3.3 The Belt and Road Initiative: A Practical Path for Transnational Cooperation</h4>
            <p>The Belt and Road Initiative offers a Chinese solution for transnational cooperation.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>4. Conclusion: Building a New Theoretical Framework for Industrial Economics</h3>
            <p>Digital transformation, sustainability, and transnational cooperation are reshaping the theoretical framework and practical applications of industrial economics. The future of industrial economics requires the integration of these three trends to build a more open, inclusive, and global theoretical system.</p>
