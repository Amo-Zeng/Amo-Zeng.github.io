            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the current wave of technological advancement, neuroimaging technology is like a bright searchlight, offering high precision and multidimensional insights that are redrawing our cognitive maps of self, human-machine interaction, and social relationships. This technology not only unveils the mysteries of the brain's complex networks but also drives a profound cognitive revolution both theoretically and practically.</p>

            <h3>Deconstructing the "Self": From Dualism to a Multidimensional Neural Network</h3>
            <p>For a long time, Descartes' mind-body dualism has dominated our understanding of the "self." However, groundbreaking advances in neuroimaging technology have completely overthrown this traditional perspective. Techniques such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) clearly demonstrate that the brain is not driven by a single "self-center" but is a complex system composed of countless neural networks.</p>

            <h3>Brain-Machine Integration: From Technological Revolution to Cognitive Boundary Expansion</h3>
            <p>The advancement of neuroimaging technology not only reconstructs the concept of the "self" theoretically but also drives revolutionary changes in the fields of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) practically. Traditional BCI technology relies on a single source of neural signals, but the integration of neuroimaging technology provides BCI with a more comprehensive and precise "brain map."</p>

            <h3>Social Neuroscience: Unveiling the Deep Mechanisms of Human Interaction</h3>
            <p>Neuroimaging technology is not only reshaping our understanding of the "self" and human-machine interaction at the individual level but also revealing the deep mechanisms of interpersonal interaction at the social level. Through high-precision brain imaging techniques, researchers can observe neural activities during social interactions, thereby unveiling the physiological mechanisms behind behavior.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Neuroimaging technology is redefining our understanding of the "self," human-machine interaction, and social relationships in unprecedented ways. By revealing the mechanism of the brain's complex networks, this technology is not only changing the direction of scientific research but also profoundly influencing our understanding of the essence of human existence.</p>
