            <h2>Shaping the Future of Human-Machine Collaboration: From Automated Planning to Intelligent Co-Creation</h2>
            <p>In today's world, where the digital wave sweeps across the globe, the evolution of automated planning technology and the city brain is leading us into a new era of intelligence. The integration of the two not only redefines the boundaries of human-machine collaboration but also profoundly changes the way urban governance and social interaction are conducted. From the initial automation of management to today's intelligent co-creation, technological progress is not only about efficiency enhancement but also a catalyst for human creativity and social synergy.</p>

            <h3>I. A New Paradigm of Automated Planning and Human-Machine Collaboration</h3>
            <p>Traditional automated planning technology is often seen as a tool to replace human decision-making, providing efficient and accurate solutions through algorithms and data. However, this one-way replacement model can no longer meet the modern society's needs for innovation and flexibility. Today, automated planning is transitioning from "replacement" to "symbiosis", becoming a catalyst for enhancing human creativity and decision-making ability.</p>

            <h3>II. The Evolution of the City Brain: From Automated Management to Intelligent Co-Creation</h3>
            <p>The transition of the city brain from automated management to intelligent co-creation is not just an upgrade in technology but a profound transformation in urban governance philosophy. This transformation foretells a future where cities will be more intelligent, inclusive, and sustainable.</p>

                <li><strong>The Rise of Intelligent Co-Creation</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Citizen Participation: From 'Observers' to 'Participants'</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Data-Driven: From 'Experience-Based Decision-Making' to 'Data-Driven Decision-Making'</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Collaborative Co-Creation: From 'Single Entity' to 'Multiple Symbiosis'</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>III. From Data-Driven to Intent-Driven: Building a More Human-Centric Automated Planning System</h3>
            <p>Traditional automated planning systems rely on preset rules and historical data. Although they can process large amounts of information and execute predefined tasks, they often lack a deep understanding of user intent, leading to discrepancies between planning results and user expectations. To overcome this limitation, researchers have proposed a new "intent-driven" approach, emphasizing the deep mining and analysis of user intent.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limitations of Data-Driven Approaches</strong></li>
                <li><strong>The New Approach of Intent-Driven</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Modal Intent Understanding Technology</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Intent-Driven Planning Frameworks</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>IV. Future Outlook</h3>
            <p>With the continuous development of technology, the integration of automated planning and the city brain will push human-machine collaboration and social governance to a higher level. Future automated planning systems will not merely be tools for data processing but intelligent partners that truly understand user intent. Through cross-modal intent understanding technology and intent-driven planning frameworks, systems will be able to offer more personalized, flexible, and human-centric services, creating a more intelligent living experience for users.</p>
