            <h2>Cancer: Multidimensional Challenges in Society, Technology, and Digital Therapies</h2>
            <p>Cancer, once a disease that struck fear into the hearts of many, is no longer merely a physiological threat. With the changing social landscape, rapid technological advancements, and the rise of digital therapies, cancer prevention and control have evolved into a multi-dimensional challenge spanning society, economy, culture, and technology. This article will delve into the complexities of cancer prevention from three perspectives: "Cancer Social Genome," "The Game of Artificial Intelligence and Cancer," and "Digital Therapies," and will propose potential future developments.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>1. Cancer Social Genome: The Multi-Faceted Impact of Social Factors</h3>
            <p>The occurrence and development of cancer are not only the result of biological processes but also the collective product of social environments, economic conditions, and cultural beliefs. We refer to these complex interactions collectively as the "Cancer Social Genome," emphasizing the central role of social factors in cancer prevention.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Social Environment:</strong> Urbanization has led to environmental pollution, work pressure, and unhealthy lifestyles, significantly increasing the risk of cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Socioeconomic Status:</strong> Residents in impoverished areas are more likely to be exposed to carcinogenic environments and have limited access to quality healthcare, resulting in high cancer incidence and mortality rates.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Context:</strong> There are significant differences in the perception and attitude towards cancer across different cultures, directly influencing cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Support:</strong> Support from family, friends, and society can help patients build confidence in overcoming the disease and alleviate negative emotions during treatment.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>2. The Game of Artificial Intelligence and Cancer: Ethical Dilemmas Under Technological Advancements</h3>
            <p>The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought unprecedented hope for early screening, precise diagnosis, and personalized treatment of cancer. However, behind technological advancements lie profound ethical dilemmas and potential risks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AI:</strong> Applications of AI in cancer, such as image recognition technology and drug response prediction, have paved new pathways for cancer prevention and control.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Dilemmas:</strong> Data privacy and algorithmic bias are two major concerns in the widespread application of AI in the cancer field.</li>
                <li><strong>Balance and博弈:</strong> Seeking a balance between technological progress and ethical standards to build a responsible AI healthcare system.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>3. Digital Therapies: Shaping the Future of Cancer Treatment</h3>
            <p>With rapid technological advancements, "digital therapies" are quietly emerging, providing cancer patients with new treatment options and management methods.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital Therapies:</strong> Offering evidence-based interventions through software applications or platforms, applicable to early screening, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenges and Ethical Dilemmas:</strong> Issues such as data privacy and security, algorithmic bias, and fairness need immediate attention.</li>
                <li><strong>Future Outlook:</strong> Building a patient-centered digital healthcare ecosystem, strengthening data privacy protection, and enhancing public awareness.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>4. Conclusion: Multidimensional Collaboration to Combat Cancer</h3>
            <p>Cancer prevention is a complex systems engineering task requiring multidimensional collaboration between society, technology, and digital therapies. By strengthening environmental protection, improving socioeconomic conditions, popularizing scientific prevention and treatment knowledge, and building a responsible AI healthcare system, we can effectively reduce the incidence and mortality rates of cancer and improve public health.</p>
