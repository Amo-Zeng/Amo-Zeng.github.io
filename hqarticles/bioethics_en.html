            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identity and Free Will:</strong> Brain-computer interface technology blurs the boundaries between humans and machines, challenging human identity and free will.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy Invasion:</strong> Brain-computer interface technology could lead to the complete invasion of privacy, severely threatening personal freedom of thought and privacy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The Fusion of AI and Biotechnology: Ethical Risks of Superintelligence</h4>
            <p>When artificial intelligence is combined with biotechnology, we might create "superintelligent entities" that surpass human capabilities. These entities could not only possess computational and decision-making abilities beyond humans, but also complex emotions and self-awareness.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Human Role Transformation:</strong> The emergence of superintelligence could lead to a transformation of the human role, or even replacement.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Risks:</strong> The ethical risks of superintelligence cannot be ignored; their rights and status need to be redefined.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Transcending Anthropocentrism: Towards a New Paradigm of Bioethics for Interconnectedness</h3>
            <p>With the escalation of environmental crises, the traditional "anthropocentric" ethical view can no longer address the increasingly severe ecological challenges. Whether it's the loss of biodiversity, climate change, or global environmental inequality, it forces us to rethink the relationship between humans and nature and to construct a more inclusive and sustainable bioethical framework.</p>
            <h4>Biotechnology: A Double-Edged Sword for Environmental Protection</h4>
            <p>Biotechnology, particularly genetic engineering, offers unprecedented opportunities for environmental protection. However, its application also raises numerous ethical controversies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Risks:</strong> Genetically modified organisms could have unpredictable impacts on ecosystems, even leading to the creation of "superorganisms."</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Justice:</strong> Developed countries use biotechnology to shift environmental governance costs, exacerbating global environmental inequality.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Predatory Development: The Violence Against Nature and the Ecosystem's Counterattack</h4>
            <p>Since the Industrial Revolution, human predatory development of nature has reached unprecedented levels. This violent behavior toward nature is fundamentally a manifestation of anthropocentric values.</p>
            <h4>Interconnectedness: Reconstructing the Ethical Paradigm of Human-Nature Relationship</h4>
            <p>In the face of environmental crises, we need to break through the limitations of anthropocentrism and establish a new ethical paradigm of "interconnectedness."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Subjectivity of Non-Human Organisms:</strong> Recognizing the subjectivity of non-human organisms and respecting their value and rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Holism:</strong> Emphasizing ecological holism, focusing on maintaining the overall balance of ecosystems.</li>
                <li><strong>Intergenerational Equity:</strong> Emphasizing intergenerational equity, leaving a healthy and sustainable Earth for future generations.</li>
            </ul>
