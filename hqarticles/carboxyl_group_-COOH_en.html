            <h3>I. The “Chemical Key” to Life: The Origin and Evolution of the Carboxyl Group</h3>
            <p>The origin of life is a scientific realm filled with mysteries, and the carboxyl group, as one of the most important functional groups in organic chemistry, plays a crucial role in this process.</p>
            <p>In the early Earth's environment, simple hydrocarbons evolved into more complex organic molecules through a series of complex chemical reactions. The formation of the carboxyl group not only demonstrated the possibility of chemical evolution in the early Earth but also laid the groundwork for the subsequent production of amino acids and proteins.</p>
            <p>The carboxyl group plays a central role in the formation of amino acids. Its presence allows organic molecules to form more complex structures, providing the necessary chemical diversity for life systems.</p>
