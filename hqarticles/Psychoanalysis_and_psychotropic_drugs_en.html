                <p>In the contemporary mental health field, biological psychiatry has undeniably taken a dominant position. The DSM-5 diagnostic system, the gold standard of evidence-based medicine, and the capital logic of the pharmaceutical industry collectively construct a hegemonic structure centered around the "neurochemical imbalance" as its core explanatory framework. Psychiatric drugs become symbols of "scientific treatment," while symptoms are reduced to measurable biomarkers—depression attributed to serotonin deficiency, anxiety explained by low GABA function, and schizophrenia归结归结 (attributed to/explained by) dopamine hyperactivity. In this context, psychoanalysis is often marginalized as a synonym for "unscientific," "outdated," or even "anti-medical." However, we argue: <strong>Psychoanalysis is not a powerless nostalgia but a profound discursive resistance</strong>—through its insistence on the symbolic, diachronic, and subjective meaning of symptoms, it wages a continuous and powerful rhetorical struggle against biomedical "neurochemical reductionism."</p>

                <h2>I. Biopower and the Disciplining of Symptoms: A Foucauldian Perspective</h2>
                <p>Michel Foucault, in <em>Discipline and Punish</em> and <em>The Birth of Biopolitics</em>, proposed the core concept of "<strong>Biopower</strong>" (biopower), pointing out that the modern state implements control by managing life (rather than punishing death), with one of its core methods being the <strong>medicalization of abnormal behavior</strong>. Mental illness thus becomes a pathological state "requiring treatment," rather than an expression of social, cultural, or subjective conflicts.</p>
                <p>Within the DSM-5 system, symptoms are thoroughly standardized, categorized, and decontextualized. Taking "Major Depressive Disorder" as an example, its diagnostic criteria rely solely on symptom count and duration, <strong>completely ignoring the underlying desire structure, historical trauma, and symbolic meaning</strong>. This classificatory logic is a typical manifestation of biopower: it compresses complex human suffering into statistically manageable, intervenable "cases," thereby facilitating institutional management and capitalist operation. Psychiatric drugs become disciplinary tools in this process—"correcting" neural activities that defy social norms through chemical means, returning the subject to a "normal" functional state.</p>
                <p>More insidiously, this discipline gains legitimacy through "scientific discourse." Pharmaceutical companies fund extensive research, continuously expanding drug indications (e.g., incorporating "social anxiety" and "generalized anxiety disorder" into drug treatment scopes), while the media promotes drugs as "brain repair tools." In this process, <strong>human suffering is thoroughly depoliticized</strong>: the subject no longer asks "Why am I suffering?" but rather "Are my neurotransmitters imbalanced?"</p>

                <h2>II. Psychoanalytic Resistance: Symptom as "Discourse"</h2>
                <p>The core resistive power of psychoanalysis lies in its <strong>resymbolization of the symptom</strong>. Freud pioneered this in <em>Studies on Hysteria</em>, proposing that symptoms are "substitutive expressions of unspeakable desires"—that is, the "<strong>symptom as discourse</strong>". Lacan further developed this, stating that the symptom is a point of rupture in the "chain of signifiers" within the symbolic order, a condensation of contradictions between the subject and language, the Other, and desire.</p>
                <p>For example, the behavior of a patient with obsessive-compulsive disorder repeatedly checking if doors and windows are locked should not be simply attributed to "neural circuit abnormalities," but may be a <strong>symbolic control over the fear of "losing control"</strong>—an unconscious reenactment of childhood trauma (e.g., lack of security due to domestic violence). Psychoanalysis does not attempt to mechanically "eliminate" the compulsive behavior but, through techniques like free association and transference analysis, reveals its underlying <strong>economy of desire</strong>: what the patient truly fears might be "being consumed by their own desire," rather than the superficial "door not being locked."</p>
                <p>This interpretive path constitutes a direct confrontation with biomedical reductionism. It refuses to reduce symptoms to biological statements like "5-HT transporter gene polymorphism" or "prefrontal-amygdala connectivity abnormalities," insisting instead that: <strong>symptoms are a special language through which the subject dialogues with the world</strong>. Even if neuroscience indeed finds correlations between OCD and orbital frontal cortex overactivity, psychoanalysis persists in asking: Why this specific region? Why does it express itself compulsively? What subjective history and personal narrative lie behind it?</p>

                <h2>III. The Irony of Neuroscience: The Bayesian Brain and Unconscious Inference</h2>
                <p>Unexpectedly, some developments in contemporary neuroscience ironically provide new scientific support for psychoanalysis. Mark Solms (2021), in <em>The Hidden Spring</em>, proposes that the brain is not a passive "reaction machine" receiving information but an active "<strong>Bayesian machine</strong> generating predictions"—it constantly predicts external inputs based on prior experience and internal models, adjusting its predictive models through "prediction errors."</p>
                <p>This model strikingly coincides with Lacan's theory of "unconscious inference." Lacan posited that the unconscious is the subject's "meaning-making" within the symbolic order—it continuously attempts to interpret its own experience, filling the gaps in the symbolic system. Solms suggests that the <strong>unconscious is precisely the brain's predictive system</strong>: it generates fundamental assumptions about "who I am" and "how the world works," exposing its mechanisms through dreams, slips of the tongue, and symptoms.</p>
                <p>For instance, a person who chronically represses anger might form a predictive model of "I should always be gentle." When reality challenges this model (e.g., being improperly offended by a colleague), a prediction error arises, but the subject cannot symbolize this conflict at the conscious level, thus expressing it through somatic symptoms (like migraines) or compulsive behaviors. This is precisely a form of <strong>unconscious Bayesian inference</strong>: the symptom becomes a "compensatory strategy" adopted by the predictive system to maintain the stability of the self-model.</p>
                <p>This theoretical development provides psychoanalysis with a legitimacy argument at the neuroscience level: <strong>the unconscious is not an "irrational" domain but another form of rationality</strong>—a predictive rationality based on emotional experience and bodily memory.</p>

                <h2>IV. The Tension of Resistance: Rhetoric or Structural Power?</h2>
                <p>However, psychoanalytic resistance faces a fundamental tension: does it remain merely at the <strong>rhetorical level</strong>, lacking genuine structural power?</p>
                <p>Within the practical healthcare system, psychoanalysis is often co-opted as a "complementary therapy"—used for "personalized treatment," "enhancing drug efficacy," or "improving patient compliance." For example, some "integrative treatment" models use psychoanalysis to "understand drug side effects" or "manage medication dependency," without truly challenging the dominant position of drugs themselves. This co-optation is an embodiment of what Foucault called the "capillarization of power": resistance is incorporated into the system, becoming a tool for its self-adjustment and optimization.</p>
                <p>More严峻 (severely/More gravely), psychoanalysis itself faces the crisis of capitalization. Private analytic clinics rely on high-fee models, making it de facto an "elite therapy"; the highly封闭 (closed/insular) nature of analytic training systems also limits the popularization of its theories and methods. Against the backdrop of the pharmaceutical industry investing billions annually in drug promotion, psychoanalysis lacks equivalent economic resources and institutional support.</p>

                <h2>V. Conclusion: The Ethics and Future of Resistance</h2>
                <p>Despite facing structural困境 (dilemmas/difficulties), psychoanalytic resistance still holds irreplaceable value. It is not only a discursive struggle but also an <strong>ethical stance</strong>: it insists that suffering has meaning, desire has truth, and the subject cannot be reduced to an appendage of neurochemistry.</p>
                <p>Under biomedical hegemony, the task of psychoanalysis may no longer be to "replace" medication but to <strong>redefine the essential meaning of "treatment"</strong>: treatment is not "eliminating symptoms" but "understanding symptoms"; not "adapting to social norms" but "recognizing the truth of one's desire within the symptom."</p>
                <p>When DSM-5 incorporates "Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder" into its diagnostic范畴 (scope/category), psychoanalysis can question: Why is prolonged mourning of a certain kind medicalized as a "disease"? When pharmaceutical companies promote "digital pills" (like smart pills monitoring medication intake), psychoanalysis can expose: Is this medical care, or a more sophisticated discipline of life?</p>
                <p>In the era of neuroscience's "Bayesian brain" theory, psychoanalysis might be approaching a new moment of legitimacy. But its true power lies not in seeking scientific validation, but in <strong>its persistent refusal to reduce the human being to a prediction machine</strong>—even if this machine could predict everything, it still cannot understand "why I dreamed of my long-departed mother."</p>
