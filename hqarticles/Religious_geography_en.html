            <h2>Ecological Spirituality, Digital Faith, and the Reshaping of Religious Space: The Evolution of Religion from Multiple Perspectives</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>In today's era of rapid globalization and informatization, religion serves not only as a pillar of personal spiritual life but also as a significant driver for environmental protection, the application of digital technology, and cultural adaptation in immigrant communities. This article integrates three themes: ecological spirituality, digital religious geography, and the reshaping of religious space in immigrant contexts, to explore the multifaceted roles of religion in modern society, revealing how it evolves and exerts influence in different environmental and cultural backgrounds.</p>

            <h3>I. Ecological Spirituality and Environmental Protection: An Interfaith Perspective</h3>
            <h4>1. Buddhism's "Symbiosis" and Reverence for Nature</h4>
            <p>Buddhism's advocated concept of "symbiosis" emphasizes the interconnectedness and interdependence of all things, which has been widely recognized in global environmental movements. By protecting sacred sites and conducting environmental education, Buddhists practice their respect for nature. Such practices are not only seen in Buddhist holy sites like Chiang Mai in Thailand and Jiuhua Mountain in China but are also spread globally through digital platforms, encouraging both believers and non-believers to participate in environmental protection. Buddhist ecological practices not only protect nature but also spread environmental concepts through digital means, creating a global influence.</p>
            <h4>2. Christianity's "Stewardship" Responsibility</h4>
            <p>Christianity, through the teachings of Genesis, emphasizes that humans should protect the environment as stewards of the earth. Many churches have started implementing green building concepts, reducing energy consumption, and providing environmental education. Additionally, through online worship and digital rituals, Christianity is adapting to modern society, using digital spaces to promote its environmental ethics. This adaptability not only shows the flexibility of religion but also expands its environmental influence through modern technology.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Religion demonstrates its powerful adaptability and influence in modern society through ecological spirituality, digital faith, and cultural adaptation in immigrant communities. Through these dimensions, religion not only provides spiritual solace on an individual level but also plays a positive role in broader social and environmental issues. In the future, religion will continue as a cultural force, promoting sustainable development and cultural diversity in the context of globalization, digitalization, and environmental protection. Through the power of religion, we can expect more believers and communities to engage in environmental protection and cultural exchange, jointly building a more harmonious world. The evolution of religion is not just an update of faith but also a significant driving force for the development of human society.</p>
