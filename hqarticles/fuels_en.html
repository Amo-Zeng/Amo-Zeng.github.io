            <h2>The Burning Civilization: The Past, Present, and Future of Fuels</h2>
            <p>The progression of human civilization has been a magnificent epic of conquering and transforming nature, and fuel is the most brilliant chapter in this epic. From the sparks of wisdom in the ancient practice of fire-making to the industrial revolution's coal-driven machines roaring, and to the graceful dances of wind and solar energy in today's clean energy wave, fuel has always played an indispensable role, propelling human society forward.</p>

            <h3>Past: The Legacy of Fire and the Dawn of Civilization</h3>
            <p>In the early dawn of human civilization, fuel options were limited, with wood, straw, and other biomass being the earliest forms of energy harnessed by humans. The use of fire brought warmth and light, and it also facilitated food processing and tool manufacturing, laying the foundation for human civilization. With advances in metallurgy, coal gradually replaced wood as the primary fuel source. The Industrial Revolution of the 18th century pushed coal's value to its peak. The invention of the steam engine allowed humanity to harness fuel on a large scale for the first time, unleashing unprecedented productivity and accelerating societal development.</p>

            <h3>Present: The Predicament of Fossil Fuels and the Rise of Clean Energy</h3>
            <p>However, the extensive use of fossil fuels has also led to serious environmental issues. Greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change, and air pollution triggering public health crises have prompted people to rethink the drawbacks of traditional energy structures. Meanwhile, rapid advancements in renewable energy technologies, such as solar, wind, and hydro power, offer new options for humanity. The proliferation of emerging technologies like electric vehicles, photovoltaic power generation, and wind power is quietly reshaping the global energy landscape.</p>
