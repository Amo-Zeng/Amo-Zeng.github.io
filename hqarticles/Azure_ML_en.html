            <h2>Integration of Azure ML with the Open-Source Ecosystem: Breaking Barriers, Building an Open AI Future</h2>
            <p>In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the open-source ecosystem has become a crucial force driving innovation and collaboration. However, many enterprise-level AI solutions often face barriers when it comes to integrating with open-source tools and frameworks, limiting developers' choices and flexibility. Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) service, despite being a Microsoft cloud offering, has played a proactive role in the open-source ecosystem. By deeply integrating open-source tools and frameworks
