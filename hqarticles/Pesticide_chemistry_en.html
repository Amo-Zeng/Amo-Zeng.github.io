                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Assessment of Overall Ecosystem Impact:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ecological risk assessment: By simulating the diffusion and accumulation of pesticides in different ecosystems, predicting their long-term effects on ecosystems.</li>
                        <li>Impact on food chains and ecological networks: Pesticides can affect the stability of the entire ecosystem through the food chain.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
