        <section class="article-content">
            <p>In the crimson waters of Utah's Great Salt Lake, Robert Smithson's <em>Spiral Jetty</em> winds across the surface like a wound. The spiral, composed of six tons of basalt, earth, and salt crystals, is not merely a visual spectacle—it is an act of "inscription" into geological time. Built in six weeks, it continues to "write" itself through the lake's cyclical cycles of drying and flooding. As the shadow of the Anthropocene looms over the Earth system, the true mission of land art has shifted from aesthetic intervention to <strong>the construction of geological archives</strong>: a material resistance against the short-sightedness of human memory.</p>

            <p>The central paradox of the Anthropocene lies in our creation of forces capable of altering the Earth system, while remaining trapped in an "immediate" mode of information consumption. Climate crises are reduced to headlines; ecological trauma becomes fleeting images on social media. As Timothy Morton observes, climate change is a "hyperobject"—transcending space and time, omnipresent yet imperceptible. Land art's materiality, however, offers a <strong>non-human narrative medium</strong>. Smithson's jetty is made of geological materials, existing on a scale measured in geological time; Walter De Maria's <em>The Lightning Field</em> in the New Mexico desert arranges 400 stainless steel rods, awaiting nature's lightning to "write" upon it—each strike a "response" from the Earth system, not an ornament of human will. These works do not tell "what we have done," but allow the <strong>Earth itself to speak</strong>.</p>

            <p>These works form "ecological memory anchors." In geology, the Anthropocene boundary relies on material evidence—radioisotopes, microplastic deposits. Land art, through <strong>intentional material deposition</strong>, transforms ecological trauma into perceptible geological strata. For example, Japanese artist Niki Horiuchi's <em>Memory Soil</em> series seals soil from Fukushima's nuclear contamination zones into glass cylinders, labeled with radiation data. This is not just art, but an "artificial stratum"—refusing to reduce disaster to statistics, and instead forcing viewers to confront ecological debt through material irreversibility. When a museum collects a painting, it preserves human aesthetics; when land art is eroded by wind, submerged, or struck by lightning, it preserves <strong>testimony of geological time</strong>.</p>

            <p>More importantly, the very scale of land art constitutes a politics of time. Human perception is locked into "immediacy," while <em>Spiral Jetty</em>'s spiral suggests the cyclical and uncontrollable nature of geological time; <em>The Lightning Field</em>'s 400 rods have been struck by lightning only dozens of times in a decade—this "slow response" is a silent critique of human efficiency worship. As the digital age accelerates historical forgetting, land art becomes an "anti-entropy device" for ecological memory through its <strong>material permanence</strong>. It offers no solutions, but merely by existing, it <strong>delays the process of forgetting</strong>.</p>

            <p>Yet the construction of archives must also guard against human narrative dominance. True geological archives should transcend human perspective, as ecologists propose in the concept of a "non-human archive"—recording glacial melt rates, shifts in soil microbial communities. If land art serves only human nostalgia, it becomes "aestheticized" ecological crisis. It must become a "co-writer" of the Earth system, not an "observer." As Smithson once said, "Art should not be taken to the museum, but returned to the Earth." This suggests the possibility of <strong>decentralized memory</strong>: archives no longer belonging to humans, but to rocks, water, lightning, and time.</p>

            <h2>Digital Nature: The Violence of Simulation and the Resistance of Anti-Simulation</h2>

            <p>When the land is digitized, this archival quality faces an unprecedented challenge. In a metaverse gallery, <em>Spiral Jetty</em> is being reconstructed via 3D scan data, allowing users in VR headsets to "walk" along the salt lake shore. Yet when wind, salt mist, geological subsidence, and microbial activity are compressed into pixel streams, the <strong>material authenticity</strong> of land art is quietly stripped away. Technological mediation is not neutral—when AI generates "perfect" landscapes, when VR simulates lightning striking <em>The Lightning Field</em>, we face a fundamental paradox: <strong>the more "real" the digital simulation, the more false the ecological experience</strong>.</p>

            <p>Baudrillard's "theory of simulation" manifests here as an ecological critique: digital reproduction is not a representation of nature, but the murder of "naturalness." The AI-generated "virtual Spiral Jetty" erases the crucial "unintended traces" in Smithson's work—the randomness of wind erosion, the cracking of salt crusts, the slow metabolism of microbes. These temporal traces in the "geological archive" are smoothed into repeatable, optimizable algorithmic models. Thus, land art shifts from <strong>recordings of Earth's co-temporal trauma</strong> to infinitely reproducible digital symbols. The VR version of <em>The Lightning Field</em> further programs lightning's <strong>delay, uncertainty, and destructive force</strong> into a "spectacle every 15 minutes," replacing nature's <strong>non-human temporality</strong> with "viewability."</p>

            <p>A deeper rupture lies in the <strong>suspension of corporeality</strong>. Phenomenology of ecology reminds us that perception is never a monologue of vision, but a <strong>dynamic entanglement</strong> between body and environment. When a user "stands" on the VR jetty, their real body remains in an air-conditioned room, skin isolated from the lake's corrosiveness, feet unable to feel the roughness of basalt. Merleau-Ponty's "body-world" embedding is severed by technological mediation, perception reduced to transmissible data packets. Haraway's "cyborg" becomes ironic: we sought to extend ecological perception through technology, but instead severed our connection to the geological body. What land art calls for is precisely <strong>de-cyborgization</strong>—an ecological ethics of returning to the body and acknowledging vulnerability.</p>

            <p>Digital nature thus becomes "simulacral landscape." On social media, videos of lightning strikes at <em>The Lightning Field</em> are edited into "miraculous moments," enhanced with electronic sound effects, while the ecological signals—climate anomalies, rising thunderstorm frequency—are completely obscured. This "digital nostalgia" creates a false sense of intimacy, reducing land art to a <strong>depoliticized</strong> consumable aesthetic symbol. It is no longer a witness to Anthropocene wounds, but incorporated into the "green capitalism" of landscape reproduction. True archives must record <strong>irreversibility</strong>, while simulation promises infinitely repeatable "perfect nature."</p>

            <p>Yet technology can also become a <strong>weapon against simulation</strong>. The artist collective "Eco Echo" embeds real-time sensors beside a virtual jetty, projecting data streams of actual lake pH levels and erosion rates, creating a stark contrast with the static model—not only exposing technology with technology, but <strong>making invisible ecological processes visible again</strong>. This strategy refuses to "beautify" nature, preserving its roughness and unpredictability, thus resisting the smooth violence of simulation.</p>

            <h2>Sensory Agency: Ethical Media for Cross-Species Empathy</h2>

            <p>Thus, land art enters its third realm: <strong>sensory agency</strong>. When human senses cannot perceive the slow movement of glaciers or the chemical conversations of microbes, can technology become an <strong>interface for non-human perception</strong>? The "Soil Sounds" team, in their work <em>Root Network</em>, transforms volatile organic compounds secreted by mycelium into sonic spectra, allowing microbial "language" to resonate in the air. This is not anthropomorphic romanticism, but <strong>an ecological phenomenological empathy</strong>—forcing humans to "hear" microbial time scales: signals measured in hours, days, months, challenging human "immediate feedback" perception habits.</p>

            <p>More radical is the "Glacial Whisper" project. Artists install geomagnetic and microseismic sensors across Greenland's ice sheet, translating the glacier's annual displacement of centimeters into low-frequency soundscapes. This "sound" is not simulation, but <strong>agency</strong>—representing the glacier's perception of crustal stress and temperature gradients. When humans hear the slow, breath-like tremors, we no longer "watch" glacial melt, but <strong>co-exist</strong> in its slow death. Here, technology is no longer complicit with simulation, but becomes an <strong>ethical medium for cross-species perception</strong>: it rejects smoothing, preserves randomness and unpredictability, allowing non-human "rhythms of existence" to emerge.</p>

            <p>Land art thus completes a triple leap: from <strong>geological archives</strong> (recording non-human trauma) to <strong>critique of technological simulation</strong> (rejecting digital beautification), finally arriving at <strong>sensory agency</strong>—it no longer asks "is nature beautiful?" but "how does nature perceive?" If Yayoi Kusama's <em>Infinity Mirrors</em> were reimagined as a "geomagnetic navigation theater," where audiences wear magnetic sensors to experience the perceptual logic of migratory birds, art would shift from human spectacle to <strong>multi-species empathy rituals</strong>. Perception would no longer be human privilege, but the erosion of rocks, the phototropism of plants, the chemotaxis of microbes—a <strong>decentered, multi-sensory network of awareness</strong>.</p>

            <h2>The Uprising of Perception: The Earth's Perceptual System Speaking for Itself</h2>

            <p>This triple loop constitutes artistic redemption in the Anthropocene: when the land is no longer merely "seen," but "heard," "co-experienced," and "represented," we truly escape perceptual colonialism. Art is no longer human representation of nature, but a <strong>medium for the Earth's perceptual system to express itself</strong>. In the fog of the Anthropocene, only by letting non-human senses speak can we learn to listen—to the slow, invisible, yet profoundly real <strong>breathing of the Earth</strong>.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Land art ultimately becomes an uprising of perception.</p>
