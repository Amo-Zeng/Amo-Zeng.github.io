            <h2>Educational Innovation: Moving from Knowledge-Based to Competency-Based</h2>
            <p>Against the backdrop of the information explosion and the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the traditional "knowledge-based" educational model has gradually revealed its limitations. The rapid iteration of knowledge makes mere memorization and accumulation difficult to meet future challenges. The demand for talents in society has shifted from single knowledge accumulation to diverse comprehensive abilities. Meanwhile, issues such as uneven distribution of educational resources, lack of innovation momentum, and difficulty in realizing personalized education have become increasingly prominent. The root cause lies in the "closedness" and "standardization" of the educational system. In this context, educational reform is imperative. We need to shift from "knowledge-based" to "competency-based," construct an open educational ecosystem, and achieve true personalized education to address the complex challenges of future society.</p>

            <h3>From "Knowledge-Based" to "Competency-Based": A Profound Transformation in Educational Goals</h3>
            <p>The "knowledge-based" educational model centers on the transmission of knowledge, viewing students as containers of knowledge, emphasizing memory, understanding, and application of existing knowledge. This model has cultivated a large number of talent with systematic knowledge for society during the industrial age, but its drawbacks have gradually emerged in the information age: the rapid updating of knowledge has led to "obsolete knowledge" dominating the classroom; the "uniform" education has ignored students' personalized development and stifled creativity; the exam-oriented education has increased students' learning burden.</p>
            <p>The "competency-based" education focuses on cultivating students' comprehensive abilities, emphasizing active learning, practical application, and self-development. Its core is student-centered, paying attention to personalized development; ability-oriented, emphasizing practice and application; and lifelong learning, cultivating citizens adaptable to future society. To achieve this goal, we need to restructure the evaluation system, establishing a more scientific, diverse, and dynamic evaluation system, breaking the single exam score evaluation model, and comprehensively measuring students' learning outcomes and development potential.</p>

            <h3>From "Closed System" to "Open Ecosystem": A Comprehensive Reconstruction of Education</h3>
            <p>The traditional educational system is like a meticulously designed "closed system," with the distribution of educational resources, the setting of teaching content, and the formulation of evaluation standards all led by educational authorities and schools, forming a highly centralized and hierarchical management system. This system has played a positive role in the industrial age, but its drawbacks have become increasingly evident with the arrival of the information age: the monopoly of resources has led to unequal opportunities; the rigidity of the model has suppressed innovation; the single evaluation has ignored personalized needs.</p>
            <p>Building an "open ecosystem" educational system means breaking the "walls" in the traditional educational system, opening up educational resources, teaching models, and evaluation mechanisms from closed to open, forming a new educational ecosystem with diverse participation and dynamic development. Specifically, we can break barriers through resource sharing, encourage innovation through model openness, and achieve diverse participation through collaborative education. This requires the joint efforts of the government, schools, and society: the government should formulate relevant policies and regulations to guide and regulate the development of "open ecosystem" education; schools should change educational concepts and actively embrace change; various sectors of society should actively participate, using their resources and advantages to provide students with diverse learning opportunities and practical platforms.</p>

            <h3>From "Uniform" to "Personalized": The Integration of Educational Equity and Individual Development</h3>
            <p>The traditional "uniform" educational model originated from the standardized production concept of the industrial age, viewing students as identical raw materials to be shaped through a unified mold. While this educational philosophy can quickly cultivate large numbers of talents, it also stifles students' individuality and ignores everyone's unique potential.</p>
            <p>The concept of "personalized education" emphasizes respect for individual differences and adopts different educational methods based on students' characteristics. Achieving personalized education requires deep reform of the education system: the evaluation system needs to shift from single score evaluation to comprehensive and multiple evaluation; curriculum settings should have greater flexibility and choice; teachers' roles need to change from knowledge transmitters to learning guides and potential discoverers; the allocation of educational resources should be more scientific and reasonable, ensuring that every student can receive educational resources suitable for their development needs.</p>
            <p>From "uniform" to "personalized" is not only a major breakthrough in educational philosophy but also a deepening of the connotation of educational equity. True educational equity is not giving everyone the same thing, but providing personalized support based on everyone's needs. Only on the basis of respecting individuality and personalized education can we achieve the unity of educational equity and efficiency, cultivating diversified talents adaptable to future society.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Path to Educational Innovation for the Future</h3>
            <p>From "knowledge-based" to "competency-based," from "closed system" to "open ecosystem," from "uniform" to "personalized," the path of educational reform has become increasingly clear. This transformation is not only an update of the educational model but also a return to the essence of educationâ€”cultivating well-rounded individuals. The future is here, and educational change is inevitable. Let us work together to jointly usher in the new era of "competency-based" education, construct an open, shared, and diverse educational ecosystem, provide every child with a stage to shine, and let education truly become the light that illuminates life.</p>
