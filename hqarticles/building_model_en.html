            <h3>Basic Principles of AR Interaction</h3>
            <p>Augmented reality technology captures images of the real environment through a camera and then uses computer vision and image processing technology to overlay virtual content (such as images, videos, text, etc.) onto the real images. The key to AR interaction lies in real-time and accuracy, i.e., virtual content needs to be updated in real-time and accurately integrated with the real environment. Currently, AR technology mainly relies on the following key technologies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Computer Vision</strong>: Used to recognize and track objects in the real environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Image Processing</strong>: Used to generate and overlay virtual content.</li>
                <li><strong>Sensor Technology</strong>: Used to capture user actions and environmental changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>: Used to improve the accuracy of recognition and tracking.</li>
