**"Math A" (Shu Jia)** typically refers to the **Advanced Mathematics Paper** in the Shanghai Gaokao (College Entrance Examination) system, representing a higher difficulty tier. Below is a detailed explanation:  

---  

### **1. Grading System of Shanghai Gaokao Mathematics**  
Shanghaiâ€™s Gaokao mathematics is divided into two levels:  
- **Math A (Advanced Paper)**: Designed for STEM, economics, and other majors requiring strong math skills. It features **broader coverage and higher difficulty**.  
- **Math B (Basic Paper)**: Tailored for humanities, arts, and social science majors, with **relatively lower difficulty**, focusing on foundational applications.  

---  

### **2. Key Features of Math A**  
- **Scope**:  
  Covers all core high school math topics, including:  
  - **Functions & Calculus** (limits, derivatives, integrals)  
  - **Algebra & Sequences** (complex numbers, matrices, recursive sequences)  
  - **Geometry** (spacial vectors, conic sections)  
  - **Probability & Statistics** (conditional probability, distributions)  
  - **Modeling & Innovative Problems** (applied word problems).  

- **Difficulty**:  
  - Final questions often integrate **multiple concepts** (e.g., functions + sequences + inequalities) or require **abstract reasoning**.  
  - Some problems approach **Olympiad-entry level** (e.g., similar to Chinese Math League preliminaries).  

- **Score Distribution**:  
  40% basics, 30% intermediate, 30% advanced (used to stratify top candidates).

### **3. Key Differences Between Math A and Math B**  
| **Category**       | **Math A**                          | **Math B**                  |  
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|  
| **Calculus**        | Focuses on applications of derivatives/integrals | Basic concepts only |  
| **Matrices**        | Tests operations & transformations  | Simple calculations         |  
| **Probability**     | Covers conditional probability, distributions | Foundational topics |  
| **Final Questions** | Complex proofs (e.g., sequence inequalities) | Applied problems   |

### **4. Preparation Tips (Math A)**  
- **Master Extended Textbook Content**:  
  Pay attention to "Extension Modules" in Shanghai textbooks (e.g., parametric equations, mathematical induction).  
- **Strengthen Calculus Skills**:  
  Practice applied problems like optimization with derivatives or area/volume integrals.  
- **Tackle Final Questions**:  
  Drill advanced topics: iterative sequences, function zeros, existence problems in geometry.  
- **Simulate Exam Conditions**:  
  Time yourself with past papers (e.g., 2023â€™s final question combined functions and sequences).  

---  

### **5. Policy Update (2024 Onward)**  
Shanghai will **eliminate the two-tier system** (Math A/B), starting with the **2026 Gaokao**.  
- **2024â€“2025 Candidates**: Continue under the current system.  
- **Future Trend**: The new unified paper will **balance STEM/humanities needs**, likely with difficulty between Math A and B.

### **FAQ**  
**Q: Does Math A include university-level content?**  
A: No, but some questions (e.g., limits, matrices) approach pre-university difficulty.  

**Q: Should non-Shanghai candidates study Math A?**  
A: Only if targeting Shanghai universitiesâ€™ elite programs (e.g., "Strong Foundations Plan"). National Gaokao candidates may reference its problem-solving logic.  

**Q: Recommended study materials?**  
A: *Shanghai Gaokao Math Mock Tests*, *HSECNU Math Tutorials*, and 10 years of past papers.

**Notes on Translation**:  
1. **Cultural Context**: Added brief explanations (e.g., "Gaokao") for international readers.  
2. **Terminology**: "æ•°ç”²" rendered as "Math A" (common equivalence in academic comparisons).  
3. **Structure**: Kept the hierarchical format for clarity, adapting bullet points to Western conventions.  
4. **Policy Detail**: Explicitly stated timelines to avoid ambiguity (e.g., "2026 Gaokao").  
5. **Tone**: Balanced formal/informal tones (e.g., FAQ section) for diverse audiences.
