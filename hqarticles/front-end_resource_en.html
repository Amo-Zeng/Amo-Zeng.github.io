            <h2>Background and Evolution</h2>
            <p>Front-end development started with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, gradually evolving into a complex field dominated by frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular. With the rapid advancement of technology, the ecosystem of front-end resources has been continuously evolving, from early single tools to today's comprehensive platforms integrating development tools, community support, online learning, and project management.</p>

            <h3>The Transition from Single Tools to Comprehensive Platforms</h3>
            <p>Early front-end development tools were primarily focused on code editors and browser developer tools. Modern front-end development tools, such as Visual Studio Code and WebStorm, not only offer powerful code editing features but also integrate debugging, version control, code hints, and a series of tools.</p>

            <h3>Challenges and Opportunities in a Global Perspective</h3>
            <p>With the acceleration of globalization, front-end development is no longer confined to a specific region or country. International communities and technological trends, multilingual resources expanding user groups, and international collaborative projects enhancing project quality bring unprecedented opportunities to front-end developers.</p>
