            <h3>SCM Challenges and Strategies from a Human Behavior Perspective</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Common Psychological Errors:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overconfidence:</strong> Many IT professionals are overconfident, overlooking security configuration details which might lead to vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring Small Issues:</strong> Weak passwords or software not updated timely are considered trivial, but their cumulative effect can lead to significant security risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Dissonance:</strong> When security measures conflict with work efficiency, employees might bypass these measures, increasing system risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Automation Bias:</strong> Over-reliance on automated tools leads to neglect of manual checks and maintenance, reducing overall system security.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. Applications of Behavioral Economics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Loss Aversion:</strong> Emphasizing potential losses from non-compliance with security configurations to foster responsibility and urgency among employees.</li>
                <li><strong>Framing Effect:</strong> Using positive framing to increase employee buy-in and compliance with security configurations.</li>
                <li><strong>Default Options:</strong> Setting the safest configurations as default to reduce behaviors that lower security levels, enhancing overall security.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Mechanisms:</strong> Providing immediate feedback on how user actions affect system security, enhancing responsibility and behavior adjustment.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Consensus Mechanisms:</strong> Network nodes must reach a consensus to ensure the legitimacy and consistency of configuration changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Timestamping:</strong> Records the time of changes, providing an immutable history log, enhancing security audit capabilities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. Smart Contract Automation in Security Configuration Management:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Reduces human error and delays, increasing efficiency and accuracy.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> All operations are recorded on the blockchain, enhancing auditability and operational transparency.</li>
                <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Smart contract execution outcomes are irreversible, ensuring configuration stability and reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Reduces reliance on third parties, enhancing system security and trust.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>3. Case Study:</strong></p>
            <p>A financial institution used blockchain technology to ensure consistency and automate permission management of configuration files, significantly improving security and operational efficiency.</p>
