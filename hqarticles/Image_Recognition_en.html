            <h2>Introduction: Is Image Recognition Still Just a "Seeing" Technology?</h2>
            <p>In the early stages of artificial intelligence, image recognition was viewed as a "passive perception" technology—mimicking the human visual system by extracting features from pixels using models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to perform classification, detection, or segmentation tasks. This paradigm defined visual intelligence as an "input-output" mapping process: image input, label output. However, with the rise of <strong>Generative Artificial Intelligence</strong> (AIGC, Artificial Intelligence Generated Content), especially the maturity of <strong>diffusion models</strong>, <strong>Generative Adversarial Networks</strong> (GANs), and <strong>Neural Radiance Fields</strong> (NeRF), image recognition is undergoing a fundamental <strong>paradigm revolution</strong>.</p>
            <p>We must now ask: <strong>Is image recognition still merely a "seeing" technology?</strong> In the AIGC era, AI can not only "see" but also "generate"; it can not only "recognize" but also "understand" and "construct." Images are no longer passive data inputs but have become the <strong>starting point and endpoint of a cognitive loop</strong>. AI validates recognition results by generating images and optimizes generation logic by recognizing them, forming a dynamic cycle: "generation as recognition, recognition as understanding." This shift marks the transition of image recognition from <strong>passive perception</strong> to <strong>active construction</strong>—it is no longer just a tool for observing the world, but a "cognitive agent" participating in world-building.</p>
            <p>This article explores this core proposition, systematically examining the paradigm shift in image recognition during the AIGC era through three dimensions: <strong>technology, ethics, and cognition</strong>. We will reveal: <strong>how the fusion of generation and recognition reshapes technological feedback loops; how this loop triggers algorithmic social construction; and how cognitive science provides a multi-scale explanatory framework for this construction</strong>. These three layers progress in tandem, pointing to a deeper question: <strong>What are we willing to let AI see?</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Part 1: Technological Paradigm — The Cognitive Loop of "Generation as Recognition"</h2>
            <p>Traditional image recognition relies on a linear "recognize-then-generate" workflow: models learn feature distributions from real data, then apply them for classification or detection. However, the rise of AIGC has shattered this unidirectional logic. Today, <strong>generation and recognition are no longer sequential stages but interdependent, mutually validating closed-loop systems</strong>.</p>
            <p>Take <strong>diffusion models</strong> (Diffusion Models) as an example. Their training process is fundamentally about "generating images from noise," and each step in generation depends on "recognizing" the image structure—the model must judge whether the current state is close to the target distribution to adjust the denoising direction. This process can be understood as an <strong>implicit recognition mechanism</strong>: generation is the continuous act of "self-recognition" to approach reality. Conversely, the generated images serve as training data to enhance the robustness of recognition models. For instance, "virtual faces" generated by Stable Diffusion are used to train facial recognition systems, significantly improving performance in edge cases such as low-light or occluded scenarios.</p>
            <p>Further breakthroughs come from <strong>Generative Recognition Architectures</strong>. Google's <strong>Imagen</strong> and <strong>Parti</strong> models optimize image recognition capabilities through "text-to-image generation" tasks. Research shows that when a model can generate high-quality images of a certain category, its recognition accuracy for that category also improves significantly. This indicates: <strong>generative ability is a "higher-order manifestation" of recognition ability</strong>. The generation process forces the model to grasp the <strong>semantic structure</strong> of objects (e.g., "a cat has ears, whiskers, and a tail") rather than relying solely on surface textures.</p>
            <p>A typical case is the <strong>AI screening system in recruitment platforms</strong>. Traditional systems can only "recognize" keywords in resumes or professional appearance in photos (e.g., suits, hairstyles). In contrast, AIGC-powered systems can <strong>actively generate "ideal candidate" images</strong> and compare them with real candidate photos to assess "match." While seemingly efficient, this process hides risks: <strong>the system defines "qualified" by generating "standard images," transforming recognition into construction</strong>. The generation-recognition loop means AI no longer just "sees"—it actively <strong>defines what is "worth being seen."</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>Transition:</strong> While this deepening technological loop enhances the flexibility and creativity of recognition, it also introduces ethical risks. When AI can actively generate images and make social judgments based on them, its "generation preferences" inevitably influence "recognition standards," thereby shaping real-world social norms. The "self-verification" logic of the technological loop may evolve into a <strong>self-reinforcing mechanism of social bias</strong>. This is precisely the starting point for Part 2—the social paradigm.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Part 2: Social Paradigm — The Bias Mirror Effect and Algorithmic Social Construction</h2>
            <p>When the "generation-as-recognition" technological loop is embedded in social systems, it may trigger a <strong>Bias Mirror Effect</strong>: AI identifies "real images" by generating "ideal images," but the generation process itself is constrained by historical biases in training data, leading to systematically distorted recognition standards.</p>
            <p>Take recruitment platforms again. A global recruitment company uses an AIGC-driven image recognition system claiming to "automatically evaluate candidates' professional appearance." The system first generates an "ideal professional image" based on images of historically successful employees—resulting in 90% of generated images being white men in dark suits, clean-shaven, with neat hairstyles. It then compares real candidate photos to these generated images, assigning "appearance match scores." Ultimately, candidates of African descent, women, older individuals, or those in religious attire consistently score lower.</p>
            <p>This case reveals the mechanism of <strong>Algorithmic Social Construction</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Bias</strong>: Training data predominantly features white male successful employees;</li>
                <li><strong>Generative Construction</strong>: AI generates "ideal images," solidifying a single aesthetic;</li>
                <li><strong>Recognition Reinforcement</strong>: The system uses this standard to evaluate new candidates, excluding diverse groups;</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Loop</strong>: Excluded groups are underrepresented in data, further amplifying bias.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This process is not merely a "recognition error" but a <strong>technological reconstruction of social norms</strong>. AI no longer just reflects social bias; through the "generate-recognize" loop, it <strong>actively constructs new social norms</strong>. Similar phenomena appear in medical AI: a skin disease diagnosis system uses generated "typical case images" to assist diagnosis. However, due to insufficient dark-skin samples in training data, generated images focus on light-skin lesions, increasing misdiagnosis rates for dark-skinned patients. In "generating typical cases," AI inadvertently defines "what is typical," transforming <strong>data scarcity into diagnostic bias</strong>.</p>
            <p>A deeper issue is that <strong>generated images possess "verisimilitude" and "authoritativeness"</strong>. When AI-generated "ideal professional images" are displayed as "success cases," users may mistake them for objective standards rather than algorithmic constructions. This <strong>cognitive illusion</strong> naturalizes social bias, making it difficult to perceive and resist.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>Transition:</strong> The construction of social bias exposes a <strong>cognitive blind spot</strong> in current generate-recognize systems: they lack metacognitive awareness of "why generate this image" or "why recognize this category." While the technological loop is efficient, it lacks self-reflection. This leads us to ask: How does the human visual system avoid similar bias? Can we draw inspiration from biological vision and cognitive science to build more "understanding" visual intelligence? This is the mission of Part 3—the cognitive paradigm.</p>
            </blockquote>

        <section>
            <h2>Part 3: Cognitive Paradigm — Multi-Scale Integration of Biological Vision and Semantic NeRF</h2>
            <p>To break the cognitive blind spot in the "generate-recognize" loop, we must adopt a <strong>cognitive science</strong> perspective. Human vision is not a simple "input-output" system but a <strong>multi-scale, semantics-driven, embodied, and participatory</strong> dynamic process. AIGC-era image recognition urgently needs to leap from "pixel-level perception" to "semantic-level understanding," with the core path being <strong>the fusion of biological vision and semantic NeRF</strong>.</p>
            <h3>1. Insights from Biological Vision: From Perception to Construction</h3>
            <p>The human visual system has three key characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Predictive Coding</strong>: The brain constantly generates an "internal model" of visual scenes and compares actual input to it, with prediction errors driving learning;</li>
                <li><strong>Attention Mechanism</strong>: Actively focuses on semantically critical regions (e.g., faces, text), rather than processing pixels uniformly;</li>
                <li><strong>Embodied Cognition</strong>: Vision is linked with action, language, and memory systems, forming a "see-move-speak" loop.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These traits show that human vision is fundamentally <strong>active construction</strong>: we don't "see" the world—we "construct" it. For AI to achieve similar capabilities, it must shift from "passive recognition" to an "active hypothesis-validation" cycle.</p>
            <h3>2. Semantic NeRF: From Geometric Reconstruction to Semantic Construction</h3>
            <p>Traditional NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) reconstructs only the <strong>geometry and appearance</strong> of scenes, whereas <strong>Semantic NeRF</strong> embeds semantic information—object categories, spatial relationships, functional properties—into 3D representations. For example, in an indoor scene, Semantic NeRF not only reconstructs the 3D shape of a "chair" but also labels its "sittability," "material," and "spatial relationship with the table."</p>
            <p>This technology provides a <strong>multi-scale understanding framework</strong> for image recognition:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pixel Scale</strong>: Recognize textures, colors;</li>
                <li><strong>Object Scale</strong>: Recognize object categories and poses;</li>
                <li><strong>Scene Scale</strong>: Understand relationships and functions among objects;</li>
                <li><strong>Semantic Scale</strong>: Infer intentions and context (e.g., "chair in a meeting room" vs. "chair in a kitchen").</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Crucially, Semantic NeRF supports <strong>counterfactual generation</strong>: AI can generate images like "what if the chair were moved?" to validate its understanding of spatial relationships. This "generate-validate" mechanism is the AI implementation of human predictive coding.</p>
            <h3>3. Case Chain Evolution: From Bias Production to Cognitive Reconstruction</h3>
            <p>Returning to the recruitment platform case. Traditional AIGC systems only generate "standard image" variants, while <strong>Semantic NeRF-powered systems</strong> can:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Generate diverse "professional appearance" variants (e.g., female executives, African engineers, doctors in hijabs);</li>
                <li>Simulate their interaction with "work environments" (e.g., meetings, labs) in 3D scenes;</li>
                <li>Evaluate different appearances based on <strong>functional match</strong> (e.g., "suitable for leading a meeting") rather than <strong>visual similarity</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This process shifts recognition standards from "who it resembles" to "what it can do," achieving a <strong>cognitive leap from visual bias to social function</strong>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Part 4: Comprehensive Discussion and Future Outlook — A Metacognitive Framework for Visual Intelligence</h2>
            <p>The evolution across technology, society, and cognition reveals a fundamental transformation in image recognition in the AIGC era: <strong>from passive perception to active construction</strong>. This transformation is not merely a technical upgrade but a <strong>shift in cognitive paradigm</strong>.</p>
            <h3>1. Interconnection and Progression of the Three Dimensions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technological Loop</strong> ("generation as recognition") provides the foundational tool for "active construction";</li>
                <li><strong>Social Construction</strong> exposes <strong>cognitive blind spots and ethical risks</strong> in the loop, revealing the dangers of "unconscious construction";</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Paradigm</strong> provides a <strong>reflective mechanism</strong>, enabling AI to "understand what it is constructing," thereby breaking bias cycles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These three form a "tool-problem-reflection" progression: without the generate-recognize loop, active construction is impossible; without exposure of social construction, the ethical consequences remain hidden; without cognitive science reflection, construction lacks <strong>controllability and explainability</strong>.</p>
            <h3>2. A Metacognitive Framework for Visual Intelligence</h3>
            <p>To address these challenges, we propose the <strong>Three Principles of Metacognition for Visual Intelligence</strong> as core design guidelines for future systems:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Traceability</strong>: Every generated image must record its <strong>data sources, generation logic, and semantic assumptions</strong>. For example, when a recruitment system generates an "ideal image," it should state: "Generated from 1,000 historical employee images, producing 3 diversity variants, with social representativeness annotated."</li>
                <li><strong>Intervenability</strong>: Systems should allow humans to <strong>dynamically adjust semantic assumptions</strong> during generation and recognition. For example, users could modify generation parameters (e.g., "increase female ratio," "include religious attire") and observe recognition changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Accountability</strong>: All generate-recognize decisions must support <strong>counterfactual explanations</strong>. For example, "Candidate A scored low because 'suit' weight was too high in generated images; reducing this weight increases score by 30%."</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These three principles form a unified <strong>Generate-Recognize-Understand (GRU)</strong> framework:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Generation</strong>: Create multiple image versions based on semantic assumptions;</li>
                <li><strong>Recognition</strong>: Evaluate input images across diverse generation outcomes;</li>
                <li><strong>Understanding</strong>: Explain "why" via metacognitive mechanisms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This framework not only improves performance but also grants AI <strong>cognitive self-reflection</strong>, transforming it from a "black-box constructor" to a "transparent collaborator."</p>
            <h3>3. Future Outlook: Toward Embodied Visual Intelligence</h3>
            <p>In the future, visual intelligence will transcend static images, evolving into <strong>dynamic, embodied, socially embedded</strong> agents. Integrated with AR/VR, robotics, and multimodal language models, AI will "see-move-speak-learn" in real-world environments, enabling <strong>active environmental construction</strong>. For example, medical AI could generate 3D models of surgical scenes to guide robotic operations, simultaneously recognizing tissue states in real time, forming a "generate-recognize-act" loop.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion: What Are We Willing to Let AI See?</h2>
            <p>Image recognition in the AIGC era is no longer a "seeing" technology—it is a "constructing" technology. It no longer merely reflects the world but participates in defining it. From recruitment to healthcare, education to justice, AI's "vision" is quietly shaping our social norms and value systems.</p>
            <p>Therefore, we must answer a fundamental philosophical question: <strong>What are we willing to let AI see?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Should AI only see "historical successes," thus reinforcing bias?</li>
                <li>Or should it see "possibilities in diversity," thereby expanding human horizons?</li>
                <li>Should AI self-reinforce within a "generate-recognize" loop, or should it possess <strong>metacognitive ability</strong> to reflect on its own construction logic?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Only through coordinated governance of technology, ethics, and cognition can we answer this question. We must build visual intelligence systems that are <strong>traceable, intervenable, and accountable</strong>, enabling AI not only to "see" but to "understand why it sees"; not only to "construct" but to "explain why it constructs."</p>
            <p>Only then can image recognition truly achieve its paradigm revolution—from <strong>passive perception to active construction</strong>—not as a tool of power, but as an <strong>extension and partner of human cognition</strong>. In this sense, AI's "eyes" will ultimately become a mirror through which we collectively examine the world and reflect on ourselves.</p>

                <p><em>"How we are seen determines how we are understood; and how AI is designed determines how we are constructed."</em></p>
