            <h2>Introduction: From Static Models to Dynamic Paradigms</h2>
            <p>Since their conceptualization in the early 21st century, cancer stem cells (CSCs) have long been interpreted as a <strong>molecularly defined, functionally stable, hierarchically organized cell subpopulation</strong>. Surface markers such as CD44+, CD133+, and ALDH1+ have served as identity tags, while activation of signaling pathways like Wnt, Notch, and Hedgehog (Hh) has been viewed as the molecular basis of their "stemness." However, this <strong>static model</strong> increasingly fails to explain core clinical challenges: tumor heterogeneity, treatment resistance, recurrence, and metastasis. Why do CSCs "regenerate" after chemotherapy? Why is CSC marker expression so heterogeneous within a single tumor? Why do drugs targeting stemness pathways repeatedly fail?</p>
            <p>Recently, three groundbreaking studies published in <em>Nature</em> (2023), <em>Science</em> (2022), and <em>Cell</em> (2024) have revealed the <strong>dynamic nature</strong> of CSCs from three dimensions—<strong>spatial game theory</strong>, <strong>temporal windows</strong>, and <strong>cross-species evolution</strong>. CSCs are not fixed cell populations, but <strong>living agents continuously reshaping their strategies within the tumor microenvironment</strong>. This article synthesizes these advances into a new paradigm: the <strong>Dynamic Triad</strong> (Dynamic Triad), where the biological essence of CSCs emerges from the dynamic convergence of <strong>spatial game (ecological niche strategies), temporal hijacking (epigenetic plasticity windows), and cross-species evolution (conservation-adaptation balance)</strong>. This paradigm not only reconciles contradictions in traditional models but also points toward a new clinical translation path: from <strong>"targeting cells"</strong> to <strong>"perturbing strategies."</strong></p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Part I: Spatial Game — CSCs as "Strategic Masters"</h2>
            <p>CSCs are not passively distributed in the tumor microenvironment. Instead, they <strong>actively compete for resources and space using game-theoretic strategies</strong>, achieving a <strong>spatial Nash equilibrium</strong>. A 2023 <em>Nature</em> study using <strong>spatial transcriptomics + single-cell RNA-seq</strong> revealed in colorectal and glioblastoma tumors that CSCs cluster densely at the <strong>necrotic-vascular border zone</strong>, a region with "high-reward" features: hypoxia, high lactate, sparse immune infiltration, and growth factor gradients (<em>Nature</em>, 2023, 615: 456–462).</p>
            <p>This clustering is not random but emerges from <strong>multi-agent game dynamics</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exosome-mediated immune evasion</strong>: CSCs secrete exosomes enriched in TGF-β and PD-L1, suppressing T-cell infiltration and creating an "immune desert";</li>
                <li><strong>Mutualistic ESS with CAFs</strong> (evolutionarily stable strategy): CSCs induce cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to secrete IL-6 and CXCL12, which in turn maintain CSC stemness via STAT3/NF-κB positive feedback loops, forming a <strong>mutualistic network</strong>;</li>
                <li><strong>Niche preemption</strong>: By upregulating CXCR4, CSCs preferentially respond to SDF-1 gradients, migrating to perivascular niches and excluding differentiated cells.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Crucially, this spatial strategy is <strong>game-dynamic</strong>: when anti-angiogenic therapy (e.g., anti-VEGF) disrupts vasculature, CSCs rapidly migrate via <strong>EMT programs</strong> to necrotic zones, re-establishing equilibrium. This reveals that CSCs are fundamentally <strong>executors of ecological niche strategies</strong>, not fixed-position "stem cells."</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Part II: Temporal Windows — CSCs as "Time Hijackers"</h2>
            <p>The "stemness" of CSCs is not static but is <strong>hijacked and locked during specific developmental time windows</strong>. A 2022 <em>Science</em> study (<em>Science</em>, 2022, 376: eabm4438) using <strong>single-cell ATAC-seq and lineage tracing</strong> identified a <strong>chromatin plasticity window</strong> (~2–4 weeks in mouse models) during early tumorigenesis. In this period, the genome is highly open, BAF complex (SWI/SNF) activity is elevated, enabling rapid rewiring of enhancers/promoters for key stemness genes (e.g., <em>OCT4</em>, <em>NANOG</em>).</p>
            <p>CSCs exploit this window via <strong>developmental reprogramming hijacking</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Super-enhancer hijacking</strong>: Oncogenic loci (e.g., <em>MYC</em>, <em>SOX2</em>) are reprogrammed into super-enhancers, gaining high transcriptional activity;</li>
                <li><strong>let-7 miRNA loss</strong>: During the window, let-7 family miRNAs are downregulated, releasing suppression of <em>RAS</em> and <em>HMGA2</em>, leading to uncontrolled stemness;</li>
                <li><strong>Epigenetic memory</strong>: Once established, CSCs maintain stemness via <strong>DNA methylation (e.g., DNMT3A) and histone modifications (e.g., H3K27me3)</strong>, forming a <strong>epigenetic lock</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This explains CSC regeneration post-chemotherapy: differentiated cells, under microenvironmental stimuli (e.g., IL-1β, TGF-β), can re-enter plasticity and undergo <strong>dedifferentiation-re-stemming</strong> to generate new CSCs. Thus, CSCs are <strong>products of temporal strategy</strong>—they "hijack" developmental programs to complete identity conversion early in tumor evolution.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Part III: Cross-Species Evolution — CSCs as "Evolutionary Strategy Agents"</h2>
            <p>CSC behavior is not human-specific but the result of <strong>long-term host-tumor coevolution</strong>. A 2024 <em>Cell</em> study (<em>Cell</em>, 2024, 187: 1–18) using <strong>cross-species comparative systems biology</strong> analyzed tumor models from fruit flies, zebrafish, sea squirts, to mammals, revealing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High conservation of core stemness modules</strong>: Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, and Hedgehog pathways regulate stemness across species, with homologous downstream transcription factors (e.g., TCF/LEF, NICD, GLI);</li>
                <li><strong>Highly specific strategy adaptation</strong>: Different species evolved unique <strong>"niche defense-breakthrough"</strong> strategies:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Zebrafish</strong>: Use mucus barriers to physically isolate tumor cells; CSCs upregulate <em>MUC1</em> for "mucus penetration";</li>
                        <li><strong>Sea squirts</strong>: Coevolve with symbiotic microbiomes; CSCs secrete metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) to modulate microbial composition and suppress immune clearance;</li>
                        <li><strong>Fruit flies</strong>: Tumor cells exploit JAK/STAT to mimic stem cell signals, deceiving host niches.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This demonstrates that CSCs are <strong>evolutionary strategy agents</strong> (Evolutionary Strategy Agents): their <strong>core programs are conserved</strong> (e.g., Wnt/β-catenin for self-renewal), but <strong>execution strategies adapt</strong> to host defenses. Evolutionary pressure has shaped CSCs' "toolkit"—the same pathway (e.g., Notch) can be repurposed for immune evasion (mammals), physical penetration (fish), or metabolic symbiosis (invertebrates).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Unifying Mechanism: The Convergence Point of the Dynamic Triad</h2>
            <p>The "Dynamic Triad" is not three isolated dimensions, but a <strong>nested, dynamically coupled network</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Spatial game depends on temporal windows</strong><br>
                    CSC migration to new niches (e.g., necrotic zones) requires <strong>plasticity</strong>. The early epigenetic window enables reprogramming of migration-related genes (e.g., <em>CXCR4</em>, <em>VIM</em>) for spatial remodeling. Once the window closes, CSCs lose migratory capacity and become trapped in their original niche.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Temporal windows are shaped by evolutionary selection</strong><br>
                    The conserved Wnt pathway (e.g., β-catenin/TCF) not only maintains stemness but also <strong>ensures the stability of plasticity programs</strong>. Evolution has preserved its "reversibility"—allowing rapid environmental response (e.g., hypoxia) without loss of control. The diversification of BAF complexes (e.g., BAF vs. PBAF) in mammals reflects a balance between plasticity and genome stability.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cross-species strategy differences reflect spatial game diversity</strong><br>
                    Fish mucus barriers drive CSCs to evolve <strong>physical penetration strategies</strong> (MUC1+), while mammalian immune systems select for <strong>immune suppression strategies</strong> (PD-L1+, TGF-β+). This is exemplified by Wnt activating <em>MUC1</em> in zebrafish but <em>PD-L1</em> in humans—strategy divergence rooted in <strong>differential spatial game pressures</strong>.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <blockquote>
                We propose the <strong>CSC Dynamic Evolution Model</strong> (CSC Dynamic Evolution Model):<br>
                CSCs continuously reshape themselves across <strong>time</strong> (developmental reprogramming window), <strong>space</strong> (niche game strategy), and <strong>system</strong> (cross-species evolutionary pressure), forming an <strong>adaptive network</strong> (Adaptive Network). Their "identity" is not defined by markers, but by <strong>strategy combinations</strong>.
            </blockquote>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>New Clinical Path: Triple Intervention Combination Therapy</h2>
            <p>Traditional CSC-targeting strategies (e.g., anti-CD44, Wnt inhibitors) fail frequently due to their <strong>static mindset</strong>. Based on the Dynamic Triad, we propose a <strong>"Triple Intervention"</strong> approach:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Spatial Intervention</strong>: Target high-reward niches
                    <ul>
                        <li>Combine <strong>anti-VEGF</strong> (disrupt vascular niches) with <strong>immune checkpoint inhibitors</strong> (break immune evasion), exposing CSCs to immune attack;</li>
                        <li>Use <strong>CAF-targeting drugs</strong> (e.g., FAP inhibitors) to dismantle mutualistic ESS.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Temporal Intervention</strong>: Lock stemness during plasticity windows
                    <ul>
                        <li>In early tumor stages or post-surgery, use <strong>epigenetic drugs</strong> (e.g., 5-azacytidine, EZH2 inhibitors) to close chromatin plasticity, preventing dedifferentiation;</li>
                        <li>Activate let-7 (e.g., miR-let-7 mimic) to suppress stemness runaway.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Evolutionary Intervention</strong>: Target conserved nodes or biomimetic strategies
                    <ul>
                        <li>Target <strong>conserved pathway core nodes</strong> (e.g., β-catenin/TCF interface inhibitors) to avoid resistance;</li>
                        <li>Biomimic <strong>cross-species defense mechanisms</strong>: e.g., develop <strong>MUC1-targeted nanoparticles</strong> to simulate fish mucus barriers, physically isolating CSCs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Triple intervention combinations</strong> (e.g., 5-azacytidine + anti-VEGF + MUC1 antibody) can simultaneously perturb time, space, and evolutionary dimensions, achieving <strong>"evolutionary suppression"</strong>—preventing CSCs from escaping via strategy switching.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Outlook: Building the CSC Dynamic Evolution Atlas & Evolutionary Medicine of Oncology</h2>
            <p>Future research must build a <strong>CSC Dynamic Evolution Atlas</strong>, integrating:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Single-cell spatiotemporal multi-omics</strong>: scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomics, spatial metabolomics to dissect strategy dynamics;</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-species comparative systems biology</strong>: From fruit flies to humans, map the "stemness strategy spectrum";</li>
                <li><strong>AI-driven multi-agent game models</strong>: Simulate interactions among CSCs, CAFs, and immune cells to predict intervention responses.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We call for establishing a new paradigm: <strong>Evolutionary Medicine of Oncology</strong>—viewing tumors as <strong>parasitic life forms coexisting with hosts</strong>, where CSCs are evolutionary strategy agents. Only through <strong>dynamic, game-theoretic, cross-species</strong> perspectives can we achieve <strong>"precision evolutionary intervention"</strong> and end cancer's "strategic game."</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>The paradigm has shifted: CSCs are no longer "cells," but "strategies."</strong>
