            <h2>Socially Responsible Investment (SRI): A Key Driver for Social-Technical Transition and Sustainable Development</h2>
            <p>In the context of global climate change, resource depletion, and increasing social inequality, Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) has emerged as a strategy that integrates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into investment decisions. SRI is gradually becoming a core force in driving social-technical transition and achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). SRI not only brings financial returns to investors but also serves as a crucial bridge between capital markets and social change by catalyzing innovation, scaling up technology applications, and driving policy reforms. Meanwhile, Impact Valuation (IV) serves as a critical tool for measuring the social and environmental benefits of SRI investments, providing a scientific basis for quantitative evaluation and enabling capital markets to allocate resources more precisely and efficiently, thereby contributing to global sustainable development.</p>

            <h3>SRI: Catalyst for Social-Technical Transition</h3>
            <p>Social-Technical Transition refers to the mutually reinforcing evolution of social and technical systems in response to complex social challenges. SRI plays multiple key roles in this transition:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Catalyzing Innovation:</strong> SRI provides financial support to innovative enterprises, helping them overcome initial barriers in technology and market access.</li>
                <li><strong>Scaling Up Technology:</strong> SRI accelerates the adoption of mature technologies, driving their large-scale application.</li>
                <li><strong>Driving Policy Change:</strong> SRI investors influence policy-making through collective action, promoting institutional innovations that support sustainable development.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Impact Valuation: The Key to Quantitative Evaluation of SRI</h3>
            <p>Impact Valuation (IV) is a methodology that quantifies social and environmental impacts, providing a powerful tool for SRI:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Precise Identification of Investment Targets:</strong> Through quantitative analysis, investors can identify opportunities that truly generate significant social and environmental benefits, avoiding "greenwashing" traps.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantitative Evaluation of Social and Environmental Benefits:</strong> Impact Valuation converts abstract social and environmental benefits into tangible monetary values, offering more objective decision-making criteria.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimizing Investment Decisions:</strong> By monetizing social and environmental benefits, investors can strike a balance between financial returns and social value.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>SRI and SDGs: Bridging Capital and Global Sustainable Development</h3>
            <p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations provide a common framework for global action. SRI is becoming a bridge connecting capital markets with the SDGs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Injecting Capital Momentum into SDGs:</strong> SRI directs capital towards enterprises and projects committed to achieving SDGs, providing continuous financial support.</li>
                <li><strong>Providing a Measurement Framework for SDGs:</strong> SRI investors can track the contributions of their portfolios to various SDGs and adjust their strategies based on evaluation results.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting Efficient Capital Allocation:</strong> SRI facilitates the effective use of resources, driving the coordinated development of economy, society, and environment.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) is not just a financial strategy; it is a key driver for social-technical transition and achieving global sustainable development goals. By catalyzing innovation, scaling up technology, and driving policy change, SRI demonstrates significant potential in addressing climate change, improving public health, and promoting social equity. Meanwhile, Impact Valuation provides a tool for quantitative evaluation, enabling SRI to measure and monetize social and environmental impacts more scientifically and systematically. Through its integration with the SDGs, SRI serves as a bridge between capital markets and sustainable development, contributing to a more sustainable, equitable, and prosperous world. In the future, with the continuous development of SRI and the refinement of Impact Valuation methodologies, its role in driving global sustainable development will become even more significant, providing stronger support for our shared future.</p>
