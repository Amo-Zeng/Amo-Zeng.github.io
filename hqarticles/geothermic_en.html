            <h3>Comprehensive Utilization of Urban Geothermal Resources</h3>
            <h4>1. Integration of Underground Space and Geothermal Systems</h4>
            <p>The development of urban underground space not only addresses the problem of insufficient surface space but also serves as a key way to enhance urban quality of life. By integrating geothermal systems with underground buildings, parking lots, shopping malls, and more, cities can achieve the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Winter Heating and Summer Cooling</strong>: Utilizing geothermal pump systems, cities can obtain stable heat from underground for winter heating while releasing building heat into the ground during summer for efficient cooling, reducing reliance on traditional energy sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Air Quality and Temperature Control</strong>: The humidity and air circulation issues of underground environments can be adjusted through geothermal systems, improving air quality and creating a healthy living environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Subway and Geothermal</strong>: Waste heat generated by subway systems can be recycled, not only for temperature regulation but also provided to surrounding buildings, forming a cycle of energy utilization.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Recovery and Utilization of Urban Waste Heat</h4>
            <p>If the waste heat generated by numerous air conditioning systems, industrial processes, and data centers in cities is not utilized, it will lead to energy waste and environmental pollution. Through innovative heat recovery technologies, this waste heat can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improve Energy Utilization Efficiency</strong>: Waste heat can be used to preheat fresh air, provide hot water supply, etc., reducing external energy consumption.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitigate Urban Heat Island Effect</strong>: By recovering and utilizing waste heat, the thermal radiation of buildings to the environment can be reduced, improving the urban climate.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Integrated Energy Management System</h4>
            <p>An intelligent energy management system that integrates geothermal, waste heat recovery, solar energy, and wind energy can monitor and optimize energy flow in real-time, achieving dynamic distribution and maximized utilization of energy.</p>

            <h3>Innovative Integration of Geothermal Energy and Agriculture</h3>
            <h4>1. Geothermal Greenhouses</h4>
            <p>Geothermal greenhouses utilize underground heat to maintain a constant temperature environment within the greenhouse, significantly extending the growing season of crops while reducing energy costs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aquaponics and Hydroponics</strong>: Geothermal energy is used to maintain the temperature of aquaponics and hydroponics systems, forming a closed-loop ecological system that improves resource utilization.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Improvement</strong>: By heating the soil with geothermal energy, microbial activity is promoted, accelerating organic matter decomposition, enhancing soil fertility, and reducing fertilizer usage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Synergistic Effects of Geothermal Energy and Renewable Energy Systems</h4>
            <p>The combination of geothermal energy with solar and wind energy can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhance Energy Stability</strong>: Geothermal energy provides stable base-load energy, compensating for the volatility of solar and wind energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimize Water Resource Management</strong>: In geothermal power generation, adopting air cooling technology and water resource recycling strategies can reduce water consumption, promoting sustainable development.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Future Outlook</h3>
            <p><strong>Technological Innovation and Policy Support</strong>: In the future, the application of geothermal energy will rely on continuous technological innovation and government policy support. Developing more efficient geothermal pump systems, smart energy management technologies, and formulating environmental protection policies will promote the wider application of geothermal energy in cities and agriculture.</p>
            <p><strong>Global Application and Local Economy</strong>: With the popularization of technology and the reduction of costs, geothermal energy will become an important component of urban planning and agricultural production worldwide. The development of geothermal energy can not only provide clean energy but also stimulate the development of related industries, such as tourism and green agriculture, promoting the sustainable development of local economies.</p>
