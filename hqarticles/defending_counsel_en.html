            <h2>The Warmth of Rule of Law and the Dual Mission of Defense Attorneys: From Guardians to Mentors in Ethical Leap</h2>
            <p>The rule of law is not merely cold statutes and rigid rules; it is also a profound expression of humanistic care and justice. In the judicial system, defense attorneys bear a unique mission, serving both as defenders of procedural justice and interpreters of the warmth of the rule of law. Their work is not limited to courtroom confrontations and strategies but also extends to psychosocial support, legal education, and the protection of defendants' rights. The transformation from "guardians" to "mentors" profoundly reflects the ethical leap of defense attorneys in the modern judicial system.</p>

            <h3>Defense Attorneys: Guardians of Procedural Justice and Messengers of the Rule of Law</h3>
            <p>The primary duty of defense attorneys is to uphold procedural justice. In court, they employ professional knowledge and meticulous thinking to challenge the prosecution's evidence, scrutinize case details, and ensure the rigor and fairness of judicial procedures. The German jurist Radbruch once pointed out, "Procedure is the watershed between the rule of law and arbitrary rule." Defense attorneys are the steadfast guardians of this watershed, ensuring the transparency and fairness of judicial procedures and preventing the abuse of state power. Through their professional advocacy, defense attorneys not only build a shield against injustice for defendants but also inject fairness into the entire judicial system.</p>
            <p>However, the role of defense attorneys extends beyond this. They are also messengers of the warmth of the rule of law, conveying it to every individual involved in the judicial process through humane care and communication. During their advocacy, they not only focus on the case itself but also on the human warmth behind it. They listen to the defendants' concerns, understand their predicaments, and fight for their deserved rights using the language of law. This care and understanding allow defendants to feel the warmth and strength of the rule of law, fostering trust in the judicial system.</p>

            <h3>Seeking the Truth Through Confrontation: Advocating for Justice</h3>
            <p>On the scales of justice, truth and fairness are two balancing forces. Defense attorneys are often positioned as the "opponents" of truth, using their adversarial stance to promote the revelation of case truth and ultimately achieve justice.</p>
            <p>Some question why defense attorneys defend "guilty" individuals. This质疑places defense attorneys in opposition to truth, suggesting that their advocacy equates to concealing truth or shielding evil. However, truth is not self-evident; the complexity of cases, limitations of evidence, and multifaceted nature of human behavior can all obscure the truth. The duty of defense attorneys is not to manufacture truth but to restore its complete picture through questioning and exploration.</p>
            <p>In confrontation, defense attorneys are like sharp scalpels, dissecting the surface of cases and piercing to the core. They challenge the prosecution's evidence chain, uncover hidden details, and argue forcefully for the defendants' rights. This confrontation is not to distort truth but to prevent it from being clouded by bias, emotion, or power. As the British jurist Bentham noted, "Judgment is a rational dialogue, and confrontation is its essential form." Defense attorneys' adversarial role is a crucial part of judicial procedures and a testament to the spirit of the rule of law.</p>

            <h3>From Guardians to Mentors: Ethical Responsibility and Rebuilding Trust in Justice</h3>
            <p>With societal progress and the evolution of judicial concepts, the role of defense attorneys is also evolving. They are not only the "guardians" of defendants but also the "mentors" who help them understand judicial procedures and rebuild trust in the justice system. This role transition reflects the deepening of defense attorneys' professional ethics and the judicial system's pursuit of humane care.</p>
            <p>As "guardians," defense attorneys use their professional legal knowledge and skills to engage in strategic maneuvers with the prosecution, fighting for the defendants' maximum interests. However, as "mentors," they take on more responsibilities in psychosocial support, legal education, and rights protection. Defendants are often filled with fear and distrust of the judicial process. Defense attorneys need to listen to their concerns, understand their anxieties, and provide psychological support and encouragement to help them face the judicial process with a more positive attitude. Additionally, many defendants lack knowledge of relevant laws and judicial procedures. Defense attorneys must explain legal regulations and litigation processes in simple terms, helping them better understand their situation and rights.</p>
            <p>The transition from "guardians" to "mentors" does not weaken the adversarial nature of defense attorneys but raises higher ethical demands. While protecting defendants' legal rights, defense attorneys must also guide them to correctly understand the judicial system and rebuild trust in it. This transition is crucial for building a fair, efficient, and humane judicial system. When defendants can understand judicial procedures, trust judicial personnel, and actively participate in the litigation process, it not only aids in the fair adjudication of cases but also enhances judicial credibility, achieving a unified legal effect and social effect.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Defense attorneys are messengers of the warmth of the rule of law, guardians of procedural justice, and ethical leaders from "guardians" to "mentors." Their work extends beyond courtroom confrontations and strategies, encompassing psychosocial support, legal education, and rights protection for defendants. Through their efforts, the rule of law becomes not only a system but also a belief, warming every heart and upholding social fairness and justice. In future judicial practices, defense attorneys should continue to uphold the spirit of the rule of law, embrace role transitions, and contribute to building a more fair, efficient, and humane judicial system.</p>
