            <h2>From "Eco-Industry" to "Industrial Ecology": Digital Empowerment and the Green Path for Rural Revitalization</h2>
            <p>The contradiction between economic development and ecological protection has long been a major challenge for human society. The traditional "eco-industry" concept attempts to integrate ecological protection measures into the existing industrial system, reducing environmental pollution through clean production and circular economy, achieving a win-win situation for both economy and ecology. However, this "passive adaptation" approach often struggles to fundamentally resolve the dilemma of development and protection, potentially falling into a vicious cycle of "pollute first, clean up later." With the rapid development of digital technologies, particularly the widespread application of big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain, eco-industry has been infused with new vitality, ushering in a new era of smart ecology. Meanwhile, the implementation of the rural revitalization strategy has brought unprecedented development opportunities to rural areas. This article explores how to achieve synergistic progress in economic development and ecological protection, opening up a green path to common prosperity, from three dimensions: the concept of "industrial ecology", digital empowerment of eco-industry, and the deep integration of eco-industry with rural revitalization.</p>

            <h3>I. From "Eco-Industry" to "Industrial Ecology": Reconstructing the Ecological Logic of Economic Development</h3>
            <p>The concept of "industrial ecology" offers a fresh perspective on resolving the contradiction between economic development and ecological protection. Unlike traditional "eco-industry", "industrial ecology" is no longer confined to the ecological transformation of existing industries but instead constructs a new industrial system centered on the ecosystem. This "proactive construction" approach places the value of ecosystem services at the core of industrial development, leading economic transformation through ecological advantages, ultimately achieving deep integration of economic development and ecological protection.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Guided by the value of ecosystem services, reconstructing the industrial value chain</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Building cross-industry, cross-regional ecological industrial clusters, achieving efficient recycling of resources</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Transforming ecological advantages into economic advantages, creating a globally competitive green industrial system</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Digital Empowerment of Eco-Industry: Ushering in a New Era of Smart Ecology</h3>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technologies, particularly the widespread application of big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain, has infused new vitality into eco-industry, ushering in a new era of smart ecology. These technologies not only enhance the precision and efficiency of ecological monitoring, assessment, and management but also provide new solutions for increasing the value of ecological products and ensuring equitable sharing of benefits.</p>

            <h3>III. Eco-Industry and Rural Revitalization: Exploring the Green Path to Common Prosperity</h3>
            <p>The high alignment of eco-industry with the rural revitalization strategy not only provides a green development path for rural areas but also lays a solid foundation for achieving the goal of common prosperity. By leveraging rural ecological resources to develop distinctive eco-industries; by integrating eco-industry with rural tourism and cultural creativity, creating new rural revitalization business models; and by establishing a multi-stakeholder eco-industry benefit linkage mechanism, ensuring equitable distribution, we can explore a sustainable path for rural revitalization.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leveraging rural ecological resources to develop distinctive eco-industries</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Integrating eco-industry with rural tourism and cultural creativity</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Establishing a multi-stakeholder eco-industry benefit linkage mechanism</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The transition from "eco-industry" to "industrial ecology" is not merely a change in concept but a profound transformation in development philosophy and practice. Digital technologies bring unprecedented opportunities to eco-industry, ushering in a new era of smart ecology. The integration of eco-industry with rural revitalization provides a green path to common prosperity. Building an ecosystem-centered industrial system requires collective efforts from the government, enterprises, and society, as well as coordinated advancement in technological, institutional, and model innovation. Under the guidance of the "industrial ecology" concept, we are confident that we will forge a new path of synergistic progress in economic development and ecological protection, contributing to the realization of harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.</p>
