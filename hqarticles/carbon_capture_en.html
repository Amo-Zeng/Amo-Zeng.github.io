            <h3>Carbon Capture and Agriculture: A Green Solution for Soil Health</h3>
            <p>Under the dual pressures of global climate change and food security, the sustainable development of traditional agriculture faces severe challenges. Carbon capture technology brings new hope to agriculture by injecting captured carbon dioxide into the soil, significantly enhancing soil health and promoting crop growth, thereby alleviating food security issues.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Precision Agriculture:</strong> Using drones, sensors, and big data analysis to monitor soil carbon content and crop growth in real-time, precision application of carbon dioxide improves fertilizer utilization and reduces resource waste.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Irrigation:</strong> Utilizing IoT technology to provide precise irrigation based on crop needs, avoiding water loss and improving water resource efficiency, which supports the promotion of carbon capture technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Agriculture:</strong> Combining carbon capture technology with ecological farming models to build a more stable farmland ecosystem, enhancing soil carbon sequestration capabilities and forming a virtuous cycle.</li>

            <h3>Carbon Capture and Cities: The Vision and Challenges of "Net-Zero Cities"</h3>
            <p>In the fight against climate change, cities, as major sources of carbon emissions, bear significant pressure to reduce emissions. The concept of "net-zero cities" has emerged, centered on embedding carbon capture devices into urban infrastructure to capture, store, or utilize carbon dioxide generated during daily urban operations, thereby achieving negative growth in urban carbon emissions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Building Sector:</strong> Integrating carbon capture concepts into building design, utilizing ventilation systems, air conditioners, and other equipment to collect carbon dioxide produced indoors and transport it to centralized facilities for capture and storage.</li>
                <li><strong>Transportation Sector:</strong> Integrating carbon capture functions into transportation hubs such as bus stops, subway stations, or facilities like electric vehicle charging stations to capture carbon dioxide emissions in real-time.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Spaces:</strong> Utilizing urban parks, green spaces, and other public areas to absorb carbon dioxide through artificial wetlands and carbon sink forests, while installing photovoltaic power generation systems on public building roofs to reduce the use of fossil fuels.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The multi-field applications of carbon capture technology demonstrate its tremendous potential in addressing climate change and promoting sustainable development. From art to agriculture, to urban planning, carbon capture technology is reshaping various aspects of our lives. Although realizing the vision of "net-zero cities" still faces numerous challenges, with continuous technological advancements and societal collaboration, carbon capture technology will undoubtedly play a crucial role in driving humanity towards a better, more sustainable future.</p>
