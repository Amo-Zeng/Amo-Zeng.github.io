            <h2>Diverse Strategies for Carbon Capture: Synergy of Biology, Construction, and Ocean</h2>
            <p>In the context of global climate change, reducing and capturing carbon dioxide (CO₂) has become a critical task for environmental protection and sustainable development. While traditional carbon capture technologies are effective, their high costs and energy consumption have spurred the development of various innovative methods. Here are three different approaches to carbon capture from the fields of biotechnology, innovative building materials, and marine ecosystem utilization, collectively advancing the diversification of carbon capture technologies.</p>

                       <li>Using technologies like CRISPR-Cas9, the microbial genome can be optimized to improve photosynthetic efficiency, for example, enhancing the activity and stability of the Rubisco enzyme to increase CO₂ uptake rate.</li>
                       <li>Genetic editing can enable microbes to maintain efficient photosynthesis even under adverse environmental conditions.</li>
                   </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Synthetic Biology</strong>:
                   <ul>
                       <li>Designing new metabolic pathways so that microbes can effectively capture carbon in various environments.</li>
                       <li>Developing microbial strains that convert CO₂ into valuable biological products (like biofuels).</li>
                   </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Adaptive Evolution</strong>:
                   <ul>
                       <li>By controlling environmental conditions, promoting the natural selection process of microbes to enhance their adaptability and carbon capture efficiency.</li>
                       <li>Simulating extreme conditions in the lab to cultivate more resilient microbes.</li>
                   </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Advantages and Challenges</strong><br>
            The advantages of microbial carbon capture include sustainability, low energy consumption, and the ability to operate in extreme environments. However, challenges include scaling up application and ensuring the safety of genetically modified microbes.</p>
