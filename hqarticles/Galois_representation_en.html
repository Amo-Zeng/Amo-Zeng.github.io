                <h3>Introduction: The Century-Spanning Echo of a Theory</h3>
                <p>In 1832, on the eve of his duel, Évariste Galois wrote down his ideas on group theory, which not only solved the centuries-old problem of solving equations by radicals but also shifted the focus of mathematics from "computation" to "structure." He could not have foreseen that this idea would eventually evolve into <strong>Galois Representations</strong>—a profound mathematical language bridging number theory, geometry, and cryptography, becoming a core tool for understanding the unity of modern mathematics, defending against the threat of quantum computing, and even rethinking the nature of mathematics itself.</p>
                <p>Today, Galois representations have transcended their original context, becoming the <strong>grammatical foundation of the Langlands Program</strong>, the <strong>mathematical defense line of post-quantum cryptography</strong>, and a <strong>paradigm of relational reality in the philosophy of mathematics</strong>. This article explains, from three dimensions—historical context, technical implementation, and philosophical implications—how they use "representation" as a medium to construct a cognitive bridge between abstraction and reality.</p>

                <h3>I. Historical Evolution: From Solvability to Categorification</h3>
                <p>Galois's initial breakthrough lay in reducing the solvability of an equation by radicals to the structural properties of its symmetry group, i.e., the "solvability" of the Galois group. This shift marked the era where mathematics centered on structure.</p>
                <p>In the early twentieth century, the birth of <strong>group representation theory</strong> realized the "linearization" of groups: embedding abstract groups into matrix groups GLₙ(K), thus enabling the use of powerful tools from linear algebra. As Serre stated: "A representation is a way a group acts on a vector space—it gives an abstract group an embodied form."</p>
                <p>In the 1950s and 60s, <strong>Serre</strong> and <strong>John Tate</strong>, among others, propelled representation theory into arithmetic depth. The introduction of <strong>l-adic Galois representations</strong> made it possible to study elliptic curves and modular forms via Tate modules. Tate further proved that the l-adic representation of an elliptic curve completely determines its arithmetic properties; representation escalated from an "auxiliary tool" to "the structure itself."</p>
                <p>The revolutionary work of Alexander Grothendieck further <strong>categorized</strong> representations: Galois representations were viewed as functors from the category of Galois groups to the category of linear representations. This perspective gave birth to <strong>étale cohomology</strong> and closely linked modular forms with Galois representations, becoming the cornerstone of the Langlands correspondence. As Langlands himself envisioned, this correspondence is like a "unified field theory in mathematics," and Galois representations are its basic vocabulary and grammar.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Historical Insight</strong>: The development of Galois representations is a continuous process of "de-intuitionalization" from concrete operations to abstract relations, from permutation groups to functor categories, with each step being a significant breakthrough in the cognitive boundaries of mathematics.</p>

                <h3>II. Technical Implementation: The Representation-Theoretic Foundation of Post-Quantum Cryptography</h3>
                <p>With the rise of quantum computing, Shor's algorithm threatens traditional cryptographic systems based on discrete logarithms and integer factorization. In this context, Galois representations provide a new algebraic infrastructure for building <strong>post-quantum secure cryptography</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Isogeny-based cryptography</strong>—such as SIDH (Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman) and CSIDH—relies on the computational difficulty of calculating isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. From a representation-theoretic perspective, an isogeny is defined by the action of the Galois group on the Tate module; its security can be translated into the <strong>irreducibility and structural complexity</strong> of the corresponding Galois representation.</p>
                <p>More crucially, <strong>p-adic Galois representations</strong> endow isogeny graphs with <strong>Ramanujan graph properties</strong>, giving them optimal expansion and mixing characteristics, thereby resisting parallel searches by quantum algorithms. Here, representation theory not only describes structure but directly encodes the algebraic constraints and security strength of key exchange.</p>
                <p>The anti-quantum advantages of isogeny-based cryptography can be summarized as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Non-commutativity and Aperiodicity</strong>: The structure of isogeny graphs is non-Abelian, blocking the period-finding mechanism of Shor-like algorithms;</li>
                    <li><strong>High-Dimensional Representation Space</strong>: p-adic representations form complex topological structures, increasing the difficulty of effective quantum state representation;</li>
                    <li><strong>Local-Global Obstacle</strong>: There exists a computational barrier between the local behavior (e.g., inertia group action) and global behavior of Galois representations, hindering global reduction.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although CSIDH has not been selected for the NIST standard due to efficiency issues, the mathematics behind it—<strong>the action of the ideal class group on Galois representations</strong>—still represents an important future direction for anti-quantum cryptography. As cryptographer David Jao noted, "We are not inventing cryptography; we are <strong>discovering and utilizing the deep structures of number theory</strong>."</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Technical Insight</strong>: Galois representations base security on the intrinsic complexity of mathematical structures, becoming the nexus connecting abstract mathematics with practical cryptographic applications.</p>

                <h3>III. Philosophical Reconstruction: Representation-Priority and Mathematical Reality</h3>
                <p>Galois representations are more than mathematical tools; they also challenge traditional philosophies of mathematics, particularly impacting the classic divide between <strong>Platonism</strong> and <strong>Formalism</strong>. They prompt us to ask: Are mathematical objects real entities independent of our modes of representation, or are they merely the sum of their representational relations?</p>
                <p>From the perspective of representation theory, mathematical objects (such as number fields or elliptic curves) are cognized through their behavior under the Galois group—for example, an elliptic curve is "defined" by properties of its l-adic Galois representation like <strong>irreducibility, semi-stability, local-global compatibility</strong>. This <strong>representation-priority</strong> epistemological path engages in a deep dialogue with the problem of the identity of mathematical objects raised by Paul Benacerraf in "What Numbers Could Not Be": if objects can only be grasped by their role within a system, how can we assert their independent existence?</p>
                <p>Galois representations support a stance of <strong>relational realism</strong>: mathematical objects are not pre-existing entities-in-themselves but emerge within a <strong>network of relations</strong> constituted by different representational systems. For instance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Category equivalences</strong> between representations suggest the identity of mathematical information;</li>
                    <li>Through <strong>modularity correspondences</strong>, different p-adic representations can reveal the same underlying object;</li>
                    <li>The <strong>local-global principle</strong> is embodied in representation theory as the structural compatibility between local and global representations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This rejects both the Platonism that relies entirely on a "world of ideas" and the Formalism that views mathematics as a mere symbolic game, instead pointing towards a <strong>structural realism based on inter-representational relations</strong>. As Grothendieck emphasized: "The true objects of mathematics are not isolated systems, but the <strong>transformations and connections</strong> between systems."</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Philosophical Insight</strong>: Galois representations reveal a new way of mathematical cognition—to understand mathematics is to understand the <strong>correspondences, equivalences, and transformations</strong> between different representational systems.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Conclusion: Cognitive Nexus and Future Prospects</h3>
                <p>From Galois's 1832 insight into group structure, through the arithmetic deepening of l-adic representations in the twentieth century, to Grothendieck's leap of categorification and current practical tests in cryptography, Galois representations have consistently been at the frontier of mathematical abstraction and cognitive expansion.</p>
                <p>They are not only the universal grammar of the Langlands Program and the key reliance for post-quantum security but also a modern model of <strong>how mathematical reality is apprehended</strong>: mathematical objects are not static existences but are constructed, cognized, and transmitted through representations. In an era where artificial intelligence is gradually介入 (intervening in) mathematical discovery, the paradigm of thinking emphasized by Galois representations—<strong>relation-priority, structural interaction, and representational plurality</strong>—may provide a new cognitive map for both machines and humans to understand mathematics.</p>
                <p>On the eve of his duel, Galois wrote: "My work is only a beginning; it will take many others to complete it." Looking back today, what he initiated was not just a theory but a <strong>profound revolution</strong> in how mathematics is represented, understood, and practiced.</p>
