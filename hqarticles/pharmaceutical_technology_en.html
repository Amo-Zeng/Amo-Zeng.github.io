            <h2>Regulatory Challenges: Regulation and Approval of Personalized Drugs</h2>
            <p>The regulation and approval process for personalized drugs faces numerous challenges. Traditional drug regulation models mainly target large-scale drug production, while the manufacturing and application of personalized drugs are highly individualized and complex. Here are some key challenges and potential solutions:</p>
            <h3>Data Standardization</h3>
            <p>Personalized drug manufacturing relies on large amounts of genomic and clinical data, but the standardization and interoperability of this data remain a challenge. To address this issue, it is necessary to establish uniform data standards and data-sharing platforms to ensure data accuracy and reliability.</p>
            <h3>Clinical Trial Design</h3>
            <p>The design of clinical trials for personalized drugs must consider individual patient differences, and traditional randomized controlled trial models may not be suitable. Solutions include adopting adaptive trial designs, dynamically adjusting trial plans based on patient responses to improve trial efficiency and accuracy.</p>
            <h3>Regulatory and Ethical Issues</h3>
            <p>Personalized drug manufacturing involves patient genomic data and privacy issues, requiring the establishment of strict regulatory and ethical frameworks to ensure data security and patient rights. Additionally, clear intellectual property rights and commercialization paths for personalized drugs need to be defined to promote technology adoption and application.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Patient Involvement: Data Sharing and Treatment Decisions</h2>
            <p>Patients play a crucial role in the personalized drug manufacturing process. Here are some key aspects of patient involvement:</p>
            <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
            <p>Patient genomic and clinical data are the foundation of personalized drug manufacturing. Patients need to actively participate in data sharing, providing detailed health information and treatment response data. To encourage patient participation in data sharing, transparent data management mechanisms must be established to protect patient privacy and data security.</p>
            <h3>Treatment Decisions</h3>
            <p>In the personalized drug manufacturing process, patients are not just data providers but also participants in treatment decisions. Doctors and patients need to jointly develop personalized treatment plans, considering the patient's specific situation and needs. Through patient education and consultation, patient knowledge and decision-making abilities can be enhanced to achieve truly personalized medicine.</p>
            <h3>Feedback and Improvement</h3>
            <p>Patients can also provide valuable feedback in the personalized drug manufacturing process, helping to improve drug design and manufacturing processes. Through patient feedback, deficiencies in drugs can be identified, treatment plans optimized, and treatment efficacy and patient satisfaction improved.</p>

            <h2>Green Pharmaceuticals: Biocatalysis, Circular Economy, and Policy Promotion</h2>
            <h3>Biocatalysis</h3>
            <p>Biocatalysis is an important means of green pharmaceuticals. Enzymes have the characteristics of high efficiency, specificity, and environmental friendliness, and can react under mild conditions, reducing energy consumption and chemical waste generation. For example, lipases can be used for esterification reactions under normal temperature and pressure, avoiding energy waste and environmental pollution under high temperature and pressure conditions.</p>
            <p>Microbial fermentation technology also plays a crucial role in green pharmaceuticals. By optimizing microbial fermentation conditions, the purity and yield of products can be improved, while reducing the generation of by-products. For example, using E. coli for recombinant protein production is not only efficient but also allows waste generated during the production process to be treated through biodegradation, reducing environmental pollution.</p>
            <h3>Circular Economy</h3>
            <p>The circular economy model achieves a balance between production efficiency and environmental protection through waste recycling and resource circulation. Waste generated in pharmaceutical processes, such as organic solvents and heavy metal waste liquids, can be recycled through recycling technologies. For example, organic solvents can be recovered through distillation, reducing waste treatment costs and environmental pollution. Additionally, heavy metal waste liquids can be recovered through ion exchange and reused in other production processes.</p>
            <p>Resource circulation is an important component of the circular economy. By optimizing production processes, resource utilization and recycling can be achieved. For example, by-products generated during pharmaceutical processes can be converted into high-value products through bioconversion technologies, such as converting discarded sugars into biofuels or high-value chemicals.</p>
            <h3>Policy Promotion</h3>
            <p>Governments play a crucial role in promoting green pharmaceuticals. By enacting environmental regulations and standards, governments can guide pharmaceutical companies towards green development. For example, the European Union's Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation requires companies to assess the environmental impact of chemicals, encouraging the adoption of green pharmaceutical technologies.</p>
            <p>Industry associations also play an important role in promoting green pharmaceuticals. By establishing industry standards and promoting green pharmaceutical technologies, industry associations can guide companies towards sustainable development. For example, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) launched the "Green Pharmaceuticals Initiative," encouraging companies to adopt green chemistry and sustainable production methods.</p>

            <h3>Blockchain Technology</h3>
            <p>The application of blockchain technology in the pharmaceutical supply chain can significantly enhance transparency and traceability. Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that can record and track the entire process of a drug from production to distribution. The application of blockchain technology has the following advantages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Blockchain technology can record the production, storage, and distribution processes of drugs in real-time, ensuring transparency at every stage and reducing the circulation of counterfeit and substandard drugs.</li>
                <li><strong>Traceability:</strong> Through blockchain technology, the source and distribution path of drugs can be quickly traced, ensuring drug quality and safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency Improvement:</strong> Blockchain technology can optimize supply chain management, reducing information asymmetry and communication costs, improving overall supply chain efficiency.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For example, some pharmaceutical companies have started using blockchain technology to record the production and distribution processes of drugs, ensuring the traceability of each drug's source and quality.</p>
            <h3>Localized Production</h3>
            <p>The localized production model involves establishing pharmaceutical production facilities near the areas of drug demand, reducing dependence on the global supply chain. The localized production model has the following advantages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Reduced Risk of Disruptions:</strong> Through localized production, dependence on long-distance logistics can be reduced, lowering the risk of supply chain disruptions and ensuring stable drug supply.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Benefits:</strong> Localized production can reduce logistics costs, improve production efficiency, increase local employment opportunities, and promote economic development.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Impact:</strong> Localized production can improve the accessibility and quality of local medical services, reducing social problems caused by drug shortages.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For example, some countries and regions have established localized pharmaceutical production facilities to effectively address drug shortages during the pandemic, ensuring the medical needs of local residents.</p>
