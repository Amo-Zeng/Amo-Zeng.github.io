            <h2>Dialogue Between Technology and Body Language: Transformation and Challenges of Theater Performance in the Digital Age</h2>
            <p>On the stage of theater, the actor's body is not merely a tool for performance but also a vessel that carries and conveys complex emotions, thoughts, and meanings. From phenomenological and semiotic perspectives, we can delve into the significant role of body language in theater, revealing how it transcends linguistic limitations, showcasing characters' inner worlds, subconscious, and even socio-cultural backgrounds on the limited stage.</p>

            <h3>The Body from a Phenomenological Perspective: A Vessel of Emotion and Being</h3>
            <p>Phenomenology emphasizes the experiential and existential nature of the body, considering it the core of perception and emotional experience. In theater, the actor's body is not only an external performance tool but also a medium for expressing internal emotions and thoughts. Through sensory experiences, gestures, and movements, actors can directly convey the emotional states and psychological activities of their characters.</p>
