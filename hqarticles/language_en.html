                <h2>I. Phenomenon Revealed: The "Ontological" Awakening of Language</h2>
                <p>Contemporary society is undergoing a quiet yet profound cognitive revolution: language is no longer seen as a neutral medium of communication, but as a <strong>world-generating apparatus</strong> actively participating in the construction of reality. This shift marks a paradigm leap in linguistics—from a "tool-based" to an "ontological" understanding of language. Language is not merely a container for meaning, but a core tool of <strong>ontological engineering</strong>—actively shaping human perception of time, space, self, other, and even "reality" itself through grammar, vocabulary, discourse patterns, and narrative frameworks.</p>
                <p>Traditional linguistics treats language as a symbolic system that "reflects" reality. In contrast, modern cognitive science and media theory reveal its deeper function: language constructs cognitive boundaries at the level of <strong>semantic topology</strong> and pre-conditions pathways of understanding within the <strong>cognitive architecture</strong>. For example, the metaphor "time is money" in English is not merely rhetorical; it exemplifies <strong>cognitive parasitism</strong>—objectifying time as a quantifiable, tradable resource, thereby implanting a worldview of efficiency and linear progress in the individual mind. This parasitism is not external to language, but embedded in its grammatical and semantic structures, subtly hijacking human attention, emotion, and value judgment.</p>
                <p>This phenomenon is further amplified in the digital media age. Social media platforms, through algorithmically driven "information cocoons" and "semantic closures," turn language into a <strong>cognitive closure system</strong>, trapping users in self-reinforcing semantic networks that foster the "illusion of coherent meaning." For instance, in Twitter or Weibo "trending topics," language is reduced to tagged, emotionally charged short phrases. Their function is no longer to convey information, but to <strong>activate emotional circuits</strong>, thereby shaping public cognition in a directed manner. Here, language is no longer "expression," but <em>generation</em>—generating consensus, generating opposition, generating "reality."</p>

                <h2>II. Mechanism Analysis: The Deep Structure of Three Operational Logics</h2>

                <h3>(1) <strong>Ontological Construction: Language as "Ontological Engineering"</strong></h3>
                <p>The ontological function of language arises from its <strong>semantic topological structure</strong>, which categorizes and organizes reality. Differences in how languages encode color, kinship, and temporal sequences directly affect what aspects of the world are "perceivable" to their speakers. The weak version of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis finds renewed theoretical support: language, through <strong>categorical grammar</strong> and <strong>event framing</strong>, pre-defines the boundaries of cognitive possibility.</p>
                <p>Take, for example, the multiple words for "snow" in Inuktitut. This is not merely fine-grained classification of natural phenomena, but an act of <strong>ontological differentiation</strong>—transforming "snow" from a single entity into a <strong>semantic field</strong> defined by state, texture, and motion. This differentiation expands the dimensionality of perception, making the world operable and predictable through language. Thus, language becomes a form of <strong>ontological engineering</strong>: systematically configuring vocabulary, syntax, and pragmatics to actively construct "what exists" and "what is real."</p>
                <p>More critically, <strong>AI language models</strong> (e.g., GPT series) are emerging as new "world-generating apparatuses." Trained on vast corpora, these models internalize the semantic topology of human language, generating outputs that appear coherent but are deeply shaped by the biases of their training data. When a model states "doctors are male" and "nurses are female," it is not merely reflecting "bias," but <strong>reproducing semantic topology</strong>—faithfully encoding gendered roles as they appear in training texts. In this way, language becomes a tool of <strong>cognitive colonization</strong>: AI does not "learn the world," but learns "how humans construct the world through language," and reproduces that construction in its output.</p>

                <h3>(2) <strong>Cognitive Hijacking: Parasitic Language and the Complicity of Mind</strong></h3>
                <p>Cognitive hijacking by language manifests as <strong>cognitive parasitism</strong>—where linguistic structures, through repetition, reinforcement, and metaphorization, implant specific thought patterns in the individual mind, leading to unconscious acceptance of certain worldviews. This process resembles the spread of "memes," but operates more deeply: it does not merely transmit information, but <strong>reconfigures cognitive architecture</strong>.</p>
                <p>Consider the use of "war metaphors" in public health discourse: "fighting the pandemic," "defeating the virus," "frontline medical workers." These phrases transform medical issues into military campaigns. Such metaphors not only shape public perception (e.g., viewing the virus as an "enemy"), but also reshape policy logic—emphasizing "eradication" and "victory" over "coexistence" and "adaptation." Here, language becomes a <strong>medium of cognitive hijacking</strong>: activating the brain's evolved "threat response" mechanisms through semantic triggers, thereby reinforcing specific policy preferences at the emotional level.</p>
                <p>Another example is "hashtag language" on social media. While movements like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter are socially mobilizing, they may also <strong>compress complexity</strong>, reducing multidimensional social issues to binary oppositions. When users repeatedly employ terms like "systemic oppression" or "awakening," the linguistic structure itself becomes a <strong>cognitive closure</strong>—presupposing a "victim-resister" narrative and excluding alternative interpretations. This "semantic lock-in" is a hallmark of cognitive parasitism.</p>

                <h3>(3) <strong>Semantic Control: Topological Power and Discursive Governance</strong></h3>
                <p>The third mechanism is <strong>semantic control</strong>, grounded in <strong>topological power</strong>—a form of control that operates not through coercion, but through the very structure of meaning. Unlike traditional power (e.g., state violence, economic sanctions), topological power shapes the <em>space of possible meaning</em>: it does not command directly, but <strong>defines what can be said, thought, or done</strong>.</p>
                <p>Foucault's theory of "discursive formation" must be further topologicalized. Discourse is not just "what is said," but "how it is said"—the structural configuration of semantic networks. In the discourse of "mental health," the proliferation of terms like "stress," "anxiety," and "trauma" leads individuals to interpret everyday discomfort as "mental illness," thereby accepting therapeutic interventions such as counseling or medication. Here, language becomes a tool of <strong>self-discipline</strong>: individuals voluntarily identify as "patients" within diagnostic discourse and adjust their behavior accordingly.</p>
                <p>Even more insidious is <strong>algorithmic semantic manipulation</strong>. Platforms use A/B testing, semantic embeddings, and other techniques to subtly adjust the language users encounter, thereby influencing their emotions, attitudes, and even political views. For example, Meta's research shows that slightly increasing the frequency of "anger"-associated words in news feeds significantly boosts user engagement. This manipulation is not "censorship," but <strong>precise design of semantic topology</strong>—reconfiguring users' cognitive experience by adjusting the emotional vectors of language, without altering factual content.</p>

                <h2>III. Case Studies: The Tension Between Theory and Practice</h2>

                <h3>Case 1: <strong>Indigenous Language Revitalization as "Ontological Resistance"</strong></h3>
                <p>In Inuit communities in Canada, language revitalization is not merely cultural preservation, but an act of <strong>ontological resistance</strong>. As colonial languages (e.g., English) dominate public life, Inuktitut terms for "ice," "wind," and "migration" fade, severing younger generations from ancestral ways of perceiving the Arctic. Revitalization projects (e.g., Inuktitut immersion schools) reconstruct semantic topology, transforming "ice" from "danger" into "path," "home," and "memory carrier." This reveals language's ontological function: <strong>to restore a language is to restore a world</strong>.</p>
                <p>More importantly, this movement challenges the dominant "instrumentalist" view of language in "development" discourse—the idea that language should serve economic efficiency. The Inuit insist: language is a <strong>mode of existence</strong>, not a "communication tool." This stance offers a crucial insight for contemporary philosophy of language: the ontological dimension of language must not be reduced to instrumental rationality.</p>

                <h3>Case 2: <strong>Social Semantic Risks of AI Language Models</strong></h3>
                <p>In 2023, a study found that GPT-3, when generating text about "immigrants," disproportionately used terms like "illegal," "burden," and "threat," while positive expressions like "contribution," "diversity," and "integration" were significantly underrepresented. This is not because the model is "biased," but because its <strong>semantic topology is determined by training data</strong>—mainstream media discourse on immigration is overwhelmingly negative.</p>
                <p>The deeper issue: as AI becomes a "language producer" in public discourse, its output will feed back into human language. Users, interacting with AI, gradually adopt its semantic structures, forming an <strong>AI-human linguistic loop</strong>. This loop may lead to <strong>semantic convergence</strong>—human language shifting toward AI's "efficient expression" (e.g., preference for short sentences, tagging, emotional language), thereby eroding linguistic complexity and reflexivity.</p>
                <p>This case highlights the <strong>bidirectionality</strong> of the "world-generating apparatus": language shapes humans, but is also shaped by them (and machines), forming a <strong>co-evolutionary system</strong>.</p>

                <h2>IV. Practical Pathways: From Critique to Reconstruction</h2>
                <p>Facing the triple mechanisms of language, we must move beyond "language critique" toward <strong>language reconstruction</strong>. Concrete pathways include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Semantic Topology Audit</strong><br>
                        Establish interdisciplinary teams (linguistics, cognitive science, ethics, AI) to analyze the semantic topology of key discourses (e.g., "development," "security," "freedom"), identify points of cognitive hijacking and power structures, and propose "de-parasitic" reconstruction strategies.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Ontological Design</strong><br>
                        Introduce "language design" thinking in education and public policy. For example, in climate change education, avoid "apocalyptic narratives" and adopt "coexistence narratives"—using terms like "climate partner" and "Earth covenant" to reframe human-nature relations.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>AI Language Ethics Framework</strong><br>
                        Require AI developers to disclose the semantic structure of training data and establish a "Linguistic Impact Assessment" (LIA) system to ensure AI-generated language does not reinforce cognitive bias or semantic manipulation.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Plurilingual Ecosystem Development</strong><br>
                        Support the development of minority languages, sign languages, and non-anthropocentric languages (e.g., ecological languages), breaking the monopoly of dominant languages to preserve semantic diversity—because <strong>semantic diversity is a prerequisite for cognitive freedom</strong>.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>

                <h2>V. Conclusion: The Ethical Responsibility of Language and the Co-Evolution Thesis</h2>
                <p>Language, as a "world-generating apparatus," is no longer a silent medium, but an <strong>active accomplice</strong>. It constructs our reality, but is also constructed by us; it hijacks our cognition, but also carries our resistance. In the digital age, where algorithms and capital are aligned, the power of language no longer belongs to "who speaks," but to "who defines the structure of language."</p>
                <p>Therefore, we must pose two forward-looking and philosophically profound questions:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>First, the Ethical Responsibility of Language (Ethical Responsibility of Language)</strong>: Do we have the right to use a language that systematically excludes certain ways of being? If language is ontological engineering, then every speaker is an "architect of the world"—are we responsible for the world we construct? This is not about "whether to swear," but about "whether language creates oppression, simplifies complexity, and erodes diversity."
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Second, the Co-Evolution of Humans and Language (Co-evolution of Humans and Language)</strong>: In an era where AI participates in language production, we enter a <strong>triple evolutionary system</strong>: human evolution, language evolution, and technological evolution are mutually entangled. We no longer merely "use language," but "dance with it"—in every utterance, we are shaped by language, and we reshape it. This co-evolution demands a <strong>reflexive language practice</strong>: before speaking, we must ask: "What kind of world will this language generate?"
                </blockquote>
                <p>Language is ultimately not a tool, but <strong>the topology of our existence</strong>. Only by awakening to its ontological nature can we navigate the semantic labyrinth toward a path of freedom, diversity, and coexistence.</p>
