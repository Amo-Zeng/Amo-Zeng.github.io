            <h2>Multi-Dimensional Defense of Data Security: Collaborative Governance Across Psychology, Geopolitics, and Sustainability</h2>
            <p>In the wave of digital transformation, data security has evolved from a purely technical issue to a complex systems engineering challenge involving human behavior, international relations, and ecological environments. This article constructs a "psychological-political-environmental" three-dimensional analytical framework to reveal deep-seated contradictions in data security and proposes systems-thinking-based collaborative governance solutions.</p>

            <h3>1. Behavioral Security Psychology: Human Cognitive Vulnerabilities and Resilience Building</h3>
            <p>Modern data security research is undergoing a "human factors turn," where behavioral security psychology provides crucial perspectives for understanding the human roots of security vulnerabilities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Biases and Security Decision-Making</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dual-system imbalance under stress: When individuals face time pressure or emotional anxiety, the intuitive fast-thinking system overrides the rational slow-thinking system, resulting in 93% of successful social engineering attacks occurring in the last two working hours (IBM Security, 2023)</li>
                        <li>Optimism bias effect: While 78% of employees believe they can identify phishing emails, only 23% actually do so accurately (Proofpoint Annual Report)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h3>Conclusion: Toward an Intelligent Security Civilization</h3>
            <p>As data security enters this new era of "psychological-political-environmental" collaborative governance, we must transcend traditional protectionist thinking to build a new security civilization integrating humanistic care, geopolitical wisdom, and ecological awareness. This represents not just technological advancement, but the ultimate test of collective human intelligence in the digital age. Future security perimeters will no longer be just firewalls and encryption algorithms, but a civilizational immunity rooted in every behavioral choice, international negotiation, and technological innovation.</p>
