            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a swarm intelligence-based optimization algorithm, first proposed by James Kennedy and Russell Eberhart in 1995. Since then, it has been widely applied in various fields. Inspired by collective behavior in nature, such as bird flocks and fish schools, PSO simulates the movement and information sharing of individuals within a group to gradually find the optimal solution. This article will review the history and evolution of PSO, explore its applications and success stories in the real world, and look towards future research directions and challenges.</p>

            <h3>History and Evolution of Particle Swarm Optimization</h3>
            <h4>1. Development History of PSO</h4>
            <p>The core idea of PSO is to simulate the movement and information sharing of individuals within a group, allowing them to collaborate to find the optimal solution. In its initial version, each individual (particle) moves within the solution space, adjusting its position based on its own experience and the group's experience. Each particle has a velocity vector that controls its direction and speed of movement within the solution space. Through continuous iteration, the particle swarm gradually converges to the global optimal solution.</p>
            <h4>Key Improvements and Variants</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inertia Weighting</strong>: Shi and Eberhart introduced the inertia weight factor in 1998 to balance global and local searches.</li>
                <li><strong>Constriction Factor</strong>: Clerc and Kennedy proposed the constriction factor method in 2002, introducing a constriction factor to ensure algorithm convergence.</li>
                <li><strong>Binary PSO</strong>: Kennedy and Eberhart proposed Binary PSO in 1997 for solving discrete optimization problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantum PSO</strong>: Sun et al. proposed Quantum PSO in 2004, introducing concepts from quantum mechanics into PSO.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>From Nature to Algorithm: Inspiration from Collective Behavior</h4>
            <p>PSO is inspired by observations of collective behavior in nature, particularly bird flocks and fish schools.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flocking</strong>: Individuals in bird flocks and fish schools maintain a certain distance and direction to form a cohesive group.</li>
                <li><strong>Information Sharing</strong>: Within a group, individuals share information through observation and imitation.</li>
                <li><strong>Leader Selection</strong>: In a group, there is often one or more leaders responsible for guiding the group's direction and behavior.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Comparison with Other Evolutionary Algorithms</h4>
            <h5>Genetic Algorithm (GA)</h5>
            <p>Genetic Algorithm (GA) is another evolutionary-based optimization algorithm, first proposed by John Holland in 1975.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Similarities</strong>: GA and PSO are both based on the concept of a group, with individuals collaborating to find the optimal solution.</li>
                <li><strong>Differences</strong>: In GA, individuals are typically represented as chromosomes, while in PSO, individuals (particles) are directly represented as positions in the solution space.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)</h5>
            <p>Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is an optimization algorithm based on ant foraging behavior, first proposed by Marco Dorigo in 1992.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Similarities</strong>: ACO and PSO are both based on the concept of a group, with individuals collaborating to find the optimal solution.</li>
                <li><strong>Differences</strong>: In ACO, individuals (ants) select paths based on pheromone concentrations, while in PSO, individuals (particles) adjust movement based on velocity and position update formulas.</li>
            </ul>
