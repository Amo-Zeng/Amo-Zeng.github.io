            <h2><span class="section-number">Introduction</span> Redefining Art as a "Mediating System"</h2>
            <p>In traditional art-historical narratives, art is often understood as "the creation of beauty," "the evolution of style," or "the inspiration of genius." However, if we shift our focus from images on canvas, forms in sculpture, and façades of architecture to the <strong>programming of perception, flows of matter, and responses to climate</strong>, we discover that art is fundamentally a <strong>mediating system</strong>—not merely a carrier of information, but a <strong>medium of human cognition, material practice, and environmental interaction</strong>.</p>
            <p>This article proposes a central thesis: <strong>Art history should be redefined as "Media Art History" (Media-Art History)</strong>, whose object of study is no longer isolated images or individual artists, but a triadic system composed of <strong>cognitive media, material media, and climate media</strong>. Within this system, art plays three interwoven roles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Medium</strong>: Through visual forms and perceptual mechanisms, it programs human ways of seeing and structures of cognition;</li>
                <li><strong>Material Medium</strong>: Through global flows of pigments, porcelain clay, fibers, and other materials, it inscribes colonial violence, technological adaptation, and ecological costs;</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Medium</strong>: Through form, material, and spatial strategies, it responds to environmental pressures, constructs ecological awareness, and generates the will for action.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These three dimensions are not isolated but deeply interwoven: <strong>cognitive programming depends on the materiality of matter; material flows are constrained by climatic conditions; and climate perception requires the interface of cognition and materiality</strong>. Art, therefore, becomes the most complex, sensitive, and profound <strong>interactive medium</strong> between humanity and the Earth. Through three cross-temporal, cross-media case studies, this article reveals the operational logic of this mediating system and constructs a theoretical framework for "Media Art History."</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2><span class="section-number">Chapter One</span> Cognitive Medium – Art as a System for Programming "Perceptual Technology"</h2>
            <p>The evolution of art from the Renaissance to the digital age has always been accompanied by <strong>deep transformations in perceptual modes</strong>. Linear perspective (15th century) and photography (19th century) were not merely technical inventions, but <strong>the construction of cognitive infrastructures</strong>.</p>

            <h3>1.1 Linear Perspective: The "Cognitive Contract" of Visual Rationality</h3>
            <p>Brunelleschi's linear perspective transformed space into a visual field precisely controllable by mathematics. It required the viewer to perceive the world through a <strong>single, fixed, rational eye</strong>, forming a "cognitive contract"—compressing three-dimensional space into a geometric order on a two-dimensional plane. Modern eye-tracking experiments (e.g., MIT's study of *The Last Supper*) show that viewers of perspective paintings exhibit a <strong>convergent scanning path</strong>: first fixing on the vanishing point, then spreading along the lines of perspective. This contrasts sharply with the random saccades of viewing natural scenes, indicating that perspective has become internalized as a "visual algorithm," training the brain to organize spatial perception through mathematical rationality.</p>
            <p>More crucially, this cognitive model <strong>coincided</strong> with the rise of urban cartography, maritime navigation, and scientific observation in the 15th century. Perspective was not just a painting technique, but a <strong>visual prototype of the modern scientific worldview</strong>—a visual rationality characterized by centralization, measurability, and disembodiment. It did not merely change "how we see," but restructured the cognitive foundations of "what is real."</p>

            <h3>1.2 Photography: The "Revolution of Perceptual Automation"</h3>
            <p>The invention of photography in the 19th century marked the "dehumanization" of visual perception. The camera, with its mechanical eye, captured instants without the painter's subjective intervention, achieving "visual automation." This technology challenged the authority of traditional painting and forced artists to rethink the essence of "seeing."</p>
            <p>Impressionist painters such as Monet and Degas, responding to photography, turned to the pictorial reconstruction of "instantaneous perception." They abandoned the pursuit of precise perspective and stable contours, instead capturing the flickering of light, visual afterimages, and blurred boundaries—precisely the "visual fragments" recorded by the camera's high-speed shutter. Neuroaesthetic studies show that such paintings activate the brain's "motion processing area" (MT/V5), rather than the "shape recognition area" (LOC) relied upon by traditional realism, indicating that Impressionism was in fact <strong>simulating the "discontinuous, fluid" visual experience revealed by photography</strong>.</p>
            <p>Photography thus became the "cognitive mediator" of Impressionism, pushing painting from "representation" to "perceptual simulation." Art here was no longer a passive aesthetic object, but an <strong>active "technological agent" shaping human perceptual capacity</strong>. Through the mechanical eye, it revealed the "irrational" dimensions of human vision—blurriness, overlap, instantaneity—thereby expanding the boundaries of perception.</p>

            <h3>1.3 The Contemporary Continuum of Cognitive Media: From VR to AI</h3>
            <p>This tradition continues in the present. Virtual Reality (VR) inherits the spatial modeling logic of perspective while integrating the immediacy and immersion of photography, "hijacking" the visual system through head-mounted displays to reconstruct spatial perception. AI-generated art, in turn, simulates human visual preferences through algorithms, forming a "<strong>reverse perceptual programming</strong>"—art not only shapes seeing, but is shaped by seeing.</p>
            <p>For example, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) analyze millions of images to learn "patterns of beauty" and generate new images aligned with human aesthetic preferences. This "algorithmic aesthetics" is, in fact, a <strong>cognitive feedback loop</strong>: human perceptual preferences are encoded into algorithms, which then generate images matching those preferences, thereby <strong>reinforcing and even distorting</strong> human visual habits.</p>
            <p>As a "cognitive medium," art has always been <strong>reconfiguring human senses</strong>, forming a "history of cognitive technology." From perspective's rational eye, to photography's mechanical eye, to VR's immersive eye and AI's algorithmic eye, art continuously redefines the essence of "seeing," becoming a <strong>laboratory for the evolution of human perception</strong>.</p>

            <h2><span class="section-number">Chapter Two</span> Material Medium – Art as a Network of "Global Material Flows" and Objectal Politics</h2>
            <p>The material composition of art is not a passive medium, but a "node" within global exchange networks—carrying colonial violence, ecological costs, technological adaptation, and cross-cultural translation, <strong>inscribing traces of "objectal politics" onto canvases and porcelain bodies</strong>.</p>

            <h3>2.1 Indigo: From Colonial Plantations to the Aesthetic Symbol of "Melancholy"</h3>
            <p>Indigo, essential in 18th-century European painting, began its journey in slave plantations across South Asia and the Caribbean. In Bengal, India, and Saint-Domingue, indigo plants were harvested, fermented, and precipitated under extreme exploitation, producing deep-blue blocks of dye. According to British East India Company records, between 1750 and 1780, over 1,000 tons of indigo were shipped annually from colonies to Europe, yielding profits exceeding 300%.</p>
            <p>The destination of this material flow was the studios of Amsterdam, London, and Paris. In Dutch Golden Age landscapes, indigo was used to depict skies, rivers, and distant mountains. In Ruisdael's *Wheatfields near Haarlem*, the deep blue sky is a <strong>visual suture of colonial matter and local landscape</strong>. The white linen cloths hanging in the painting are, in fact, the "purified" precursors of indigo dye.</p>
            <p>More profoundly, indigo in European art gradually became <strong>aestheticized</strong> as a symbol of "melancholy" (*melancholia*) and "the sublime" (*sublime*). In the works of Goya and Friedrich, indigo skies and shadows create a "spiritual depth"—a meaning <strong>precisely built upon violence against colonial ecosystems and bodies</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Objectal politics is revealed here</strong>: indigo's materiality (its depth, cool tone, and fade resistance) was transformed into a "sublime melancholy," a transformation that <strong>concealed the slave labor and land exploitation</strong> behind it. Art's "beauty" became a <strong>aesthetic translation of colonial violence</strong>.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Kaolin: The "Technological Translation" and Reverse Influence of Chinese Porcelain Clay in Japan</h3>
            <p>In 1616, Korean potter Lee Chansam was captured and brought to Japan, where he discovered "Izumiyama stone" (kaolin) and successfully replicated Chinese blue-and-white porcelain techniques. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis reveals that early Arita porcelain <strong>deviated from the original Jingdezhen formula in kaolin-to-quartz ratio</strong>. Due to higher iron content in local kaolin, more quartz was added to lower the melting point, and a "multi-stage firing" technique was adopted.</p>
            <p>This <strong>material adaptation</strong> gave Japanese porcelain a unique character—whiter, more brittle, and with a "cold glow." By the late 17th century, Arita porcelain was exported en masse to Europe via the Dutch East India Company, becoming "Imari ware." Its blue-and-white patterns, asymmetric compositions, and "kakiemon" glazes rapidly influenced European Rococo art.</p>
            <p>XRF data shows that European imitations commonly contained lead glass to mimic Japanese porcelain's luster, yet caused yellowing. This <strong>material difference</strong> forced European artists to adapt: the Rococo aesthetic of "lightness," "fluidity," and "asymmetry" partly emerged from the misreading and reinvention of "Japanese porcelain's materiality."</p>
            <p>Here, <strong>material flow enabled "reverse cultural export"</strong>: kaolin was not just a technical carrier, but a <strong>battlefield of cross-cultural "objectal politics"</strong>. Japan achieved cultural autonomy through "technological translation," while Europe, misreading "otherness," reconstructed its own aesthetic paradigms.</p>

            <h3>2.3 Core Insight of Material Media</h3>
            <p>Art's "style" does not stem from genius inspiration, but from the "crystallization" of global material flows and knowledge networks at specific nodes. <strong>Behind every gram of pigment, how many hectares of land and hours of labor?</strong> Material media demand that we ask: What are the ecological exploitation, colonial violence, and technological inequalities behind art? It reveals that <strong>art history is, at its core, a "history of objectal politics"</strong>—the ways materials are extracted, transported, processed, and used determine art's form, meaning, and power structures.</p>

            <h2><span class="section-number">Chapter Three</span> Climate Medium – Art as a Regulator and Agent of "Environmental Perception"</h2>
            <p>Art is not merely a "recorder" of climate, but a <strong>regulator and agent</strong> of climate. From the Little Ice Age (14th–15th c.) to today's climate crisis, art has consistently used formal innovation to make humanity "re-perceive" its place in the ecosystem.</p>

            <h3>3.1 The Little Ice Age and "Light Management" in Stained Glass – The Church as an Artificial Light-Climate Regulator</h3>
            <p>Europe in the 14th–15th centuries was in the early phase of the Little Ice Age. Ice core and tree-ring data show that annual sunlight in Western Europe decreased by 10–15%. The stained-glass system at Chartres Cathedral underwent a notable "color shift" during this period: <strong>cool tones (blue, green, purple) increased in proportion</strong>. Blue glass has high transmittance for short-wavelength blue light, making it more perceptible in low-light conditions—a "visual compensation" function.</p>
            <p>Contemporary glass panels were on average 0.5–1 mm thicker, with more complex lead cames at edges, enhancing wind resistance and focusing limited light through <strong>micro-lens effects</strong> to increase interior illumination. North façade windows were enlarged, while south façades used high clerestory windows and reflective stone walls, forming a "<strong>cold-light import system</strong>."</p>
            <p>This "light management" strategy was, in fact, an <strong>artificial light-climate regulator</strong>: stained glass was no longer merely religious symbolism, but a <strong>techno-aesthetic complex responding to reduced sunlight</strong>. Through color choice, material thickness, and spatial layout, it actively regulated the church's internal light climate, mitigating the psychological oppression and ritual disruption caused by "climatic darkness."</p>
            <p>Deeper still, the rise of cool tones reflected <strong>collective ecological anxiety</strong>: blue symbolized "divine protection," becoming a plea for "divine light" in an age of climate uncertainty—a <strong>spiritual climate defense mechanism</strong>.</p>

            <h3>3.2 *Ice Watch* and Data Embodiment – Generating Embodied Climate Experience</h3>
            <p>Olafur Eliasson's *Ice Watch* transported Greenlandic glacial ice to city squares, allowing it to melt slowly. This project exemplifies the contemporary "climate medium," centered on <strong>data embodiment</strong> and <strong>embodied climate experience</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>From abstract data to sensory reality</strong>: Placing the "global glacial loss of one second" (100 tons of ice) in urban centers transforms "one second of melting" from a number into a <strong>visible, audible, tangible physical process</strong>;</li>
                <li><strong>Audience behavioral data reveals perception mechanisms</strong>: Average stay time: 17 minutes; 78% of social media mentions included words like "melting," "time," "disappearance"; 42% of visitors actively consulted climate change resources;</li>
                <li><strong>Fragility as an ethical trigger</strong>: The transience of ice becomes a direct symbol of "ecological vulnerability," triggering "co-temporal mourning"—an immediate emotional response to ongoing ecological loss.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>*Ice Watch* embeds "polar crisis" into "daily urban life," breaking the illusion that "climate is distant," enabling the public to unconsciously participate in a <strong>collective construction of climate consciousness</strong> through walking, photographing, and conversing.</p>

            <h3>3.3 The Triple Function of Climate Media</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitive function</strong>: Perceptual regulation and data translation;</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional function</strong>: Anxiety arousal and empathy construction;</li>
                <li><strong>Action function</strong>: Ethical call and behavioral guidance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here, art becomes an <strong>"embodied interface" for ecological consciousness</strong>, transforming abstract climate science into something perceptible, thinkable, and actionable.</p>

                <li><strong>Climate perception requires cognitive and material interfaces</strong>: Stained-glass "light management" relies on glass's physical responsiveness; *Ice Watch*'s "data embodiment" depends on ice's materiality and embodied cognition.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Deep logic of the triad</strong>: As a "mediating system," art's <strong>mediality</strong> (mediality) manifests in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intermediacy</strong> (intermediacy): Establishing connections between cognition, materiality, and climate;</li>
                <li><strong>Responsiveness</strong> (responsiveness): Formally adapting to technological, ecological, and social pressures;</li>
                <li><strong>Agency</strong> (actorship): Not merely reflecting reality, but constructing it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This model expands art history's explanatory power:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Beyond "image-centeredness"</strong>: Focusing on perceptual mechanisms, material flows, and environmental responses;</li>
                <li><strong>Beyond "style analysis"</strong>: Revealing the technological, ecological, and political-economic logic behind artistic change;</li>
                <li><strong>Enabling "interdisciplinary integration"</strong>: Merging cognitive science, global history, environmental history, and STS.</li>

            <h2><span class="section-number">Conclusion</span> Toward "Media Art History" – A Paradigm Shift in Art History</h2>
            <p>Through the trio of "cognitive medium," "material medium," and "climate medium," this article demonstrates the central thesis: <strong>art as a mediating system of human-environment interaction</strong>. Art history should no longer be seen merely as the evolution of styles, schools, and masters, but redefined as <strong>"Media Art History"</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Media Art History</strong> is characterized by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Object of study</strong>: From "images" to "mediating systems";</li>
                <li><strong>Methodology</strong>: Interdisciplinary integration, emphasizing experimental methods (e.g., eye-tracking, XRF, behavioral data), archival research, and critical analysis;</li>
                <li><strong>Theoretical framework</strong>: Centered on the "Media Triad Model," revealing art's intermediacy, responsiveness, and agency;</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical orientation</strong>: Questioning the ecological costs, colonial violence, and technological inequalities behind art;</li>
                <li><strong>Contemporary value</strong>: In the digital and ecological age, art as a "perceptual regulator," "node in material networks," and "climate agent" possesses irreplaceable social functions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The true "depth" of art does not lie within the frame, but in <strong>the flows of matter across oceans, the programming of cognition that reshapes the brain, and the formal innovations that respond to climate</strong>. Only by acknowledging these multidimensional medialities can we understand: <strong>every painting is a medium of dialogue between humanity and the Earth</strong>.</p>
            <p>In an era of climate crisis and digital technology, <strong>Media Art History</strong> is not merely an academic paradigm, but a form of <strong>survival intelligence</strong>—teaching us how to "see" anew, "perceive" anew, and "act" anew.</p>
            <blockquote>
                "We are not studying art, but using art to understand how we are shaped by the world—and how we shape it."<br>
                —This, precisely, is the ultimate mission of Media Art History.
            </blockquote>
