            <h3>1. The Democratization of LiDAR: From High-End Technology to Inclusive Applications</h3>
            <p>In the past, LiDAR was considered a sensor exclusive to autonomous vehicles due to its high cost and complex manufacturing processes. However, with continuous technological advancements and mass production, the cost of LiDAR has significantly dropped while its performance has improved. Today, it is widely used in smart mobility, smart homes, service robots, and industrial automation, serving as a model for technology inclusion.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smart Mobility:</strong> LiDAR provides precise spatial perception for high-definition maps and autonomous taxis, making travel safer and more efficient.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Homes:</strong> LiDAR empowers sweeping robots, smart surveillance, and virtual assistants, enhancing home intelligence.</li>
                <li><strong>Service Robots:</strong> LiDAR helps restaurant delivery robots and hotel concierge robots achieve precise navigation, driving the intelligent upgrade of the service industry.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial Automation:</strong> LiDAR assists robots in achieving more accurate positioning and operations, improving production efficiency and safety.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. LiDAR: The "Invisible Code" of Autonomous Driving</h3>
            <p>The core of autonomous driving technology lies in environmental perception, and LiDAR, with its high-precision 3D perception capabilities, serves as the "eyes" of autonomous vehicles. Compared to traditional cameras and radars, LiDAR offers all-weather operation, high-precision 3D perception, and powerful object recognition capabilities, providing autonomous driving with continuous and reliable perception data.</p>
            <p>Although LiDAR has shown great potential in the autonomous driving field, its high cost, large size, and energy consumption issues remain bottlenecks for its widespread adoption. In the future, LiDAR will be deeply integrated with other sensor technologies (such as cameras and radars) to form a multi-sensor complementary "perception brain," providing autonomous driving with more comprehensive and accurate environmental perception capabilities.</p>
