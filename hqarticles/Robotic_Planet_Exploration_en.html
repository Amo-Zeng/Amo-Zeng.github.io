            <h2>Revolutionary Advances in Robotics for Space Exploration</h2>
            <p>In humanity's endless quest for the cosmos, the role of robots is increasingly prominent. They are not only the pioneers and laborers of exploration but also the extension of human intelligence. Especially in the face of complex and ever-changing extraterrestrial environments, robots' biomimicry technology, self-replication capabilities, and interaction with extraterrestrial intelligence are leading revolutionary advancements in this field.</p>

            <h3>Biomimicry Technology in Robots</h3>
            <p>Robotic biomimicry technology utilizes the principles of bionics to enable robots to mimic the sensory and mobility capabilities of specific organisms, thereby exhibiting outstanding adaptability and efficiency in planetary exploration. For instance, by mimicking the six-legged walking mechanism of insects, scientists have designed robots that can move freely over rugged terrain, whether navigating through rocks and gravel or responding to sudden changes in topography, with ease. Additionally, mimicking the flight skills of birds offers new possibilities for robot exploration in high-altitude extraterrestrial environments.</p>

            <h3>Self-Replication Capabilities of Robots</h3>
            <p>The self-replication capabilities of robots greatly enhance the sustainability and coverage of exploration missions. On distant planets, robots can replicate themselves using local resources, reducing dependence on external supplies and significantly lowering transportation costs and risks. Material collection is a critical part of the self-replication process, requiring robots to have highly intelligent sensing and decision-making systems to ensure efficiency and optimal use of resources.</p>

            <h3>Interacting with Extraterrestrial Intelligence</h3>
            <p>The search for extraterrestrial intelligent life has always been a significant goal of human scientific exploration. With technological advancements, robots are tasked with interacting and communicating with potential extraterrestrial intelligences. To achieve communication with extraterrestrial intelligence, robots need advanced signal processing and transmission capabilities, including multimodal signal processing, high-bandwidth communication, and signal encoding and decoding mechanisms. The language learning ability of robots is key to their interaction with extraterrestrial intelligence, including adaptive learning algorithms, contextual understanding, and cultural adaptability.</p>
