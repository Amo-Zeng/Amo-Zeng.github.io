            <h2>Applications of Gene Engineering in Ecological Conservation</h2>
            <p>The applications of gene engineering in ecological conservation are primarily demonstrated through gene editing and gene drive technologies. Gene editing technologies, especially the CRISPR-Cas9 system, allow scientists to precisely modify the genes of organisms, thereby enhancing the adaptability and resistance of endangered species. Additionally, gene drive technology can enforce the spread of specific genes within a population, effectively controlling pest populations and reducing the use of chemical pesticides, thus safeguarding the diversity and health of ecosystems.</p>

            <h2>Applications of Gene Engineering in Personalized Medicine</h2>
            <p>In the field of personalized medicine, gene engineering is advancing healthcare towards a more precise and individualized approach through applications such as gene editing, gene testing, and drug development. Gene editing technology offers new means to treat genetic diseases, for instance, by editing the genes that cause cystic fibrosis, thereby treating the disease at its root. Furthermore, the application of gene engineering in drug development, such as the production of personalized vaccines and therapeutic drugs, is reshaping the paradigm of healthcare.</p>

            <h2>In-depth Discussion on Ethical and Social Impacts</h2>
            <p>The applications of gene engineering not only involve technical aspects but also touch upon ethical issues related to human dignity, autonomy, and social inequality. The use of gene editing technology in human germline cells and embryos raises a series of ethical debates about "designer babies" and "perfect genes." Therefore, it is crucial to establish a regulatory framework that balances scientific progress with ethical principles.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Gene engineering holds significant potential and challenges in ecological conservation, personalized medicine, and ethical and social impacts. Through precise scientific research and thoughtful ethical considerations, gene engineering has the potential to become a key tool in promoting biodiversity conservation, ecosystem restoration, and healthcare innovation. However, progress in this field must be made under the premise of ensuring ecological safety and sustainability, in order to achieve true environmental welfare and long-term ecological balance.</p>
