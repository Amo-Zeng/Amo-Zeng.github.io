            <h3>Revolutionary Role of SNPs in Personalized Medicine</h3>
            <p>At the heart of personalized medicine is the precise identification and application of SNPs. By analyzing an individual's genome, doctors can tailor medications and treatment plans for each patient, significantly improving outcomes and reducing side effects.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Interactions Between SNPs and the Environment</h3>
            <p>SNPs form the basis of genetic diversity and are crucial mediators of how environmental factors influence individual health sensitivity. Identifying and understanding the patterns of SNP-environment interactions is vital for formulating targeted environmental protection policies.</p>

            <h3>SNPs Revealing Genetic Traces of Human History</h3>
            <p>SNP data have unique advantages in unveiling human migration patterns, cultural genetic connections, and the impact of ancient environmental changes on the human genome. These studies not only deepen our understanding of genetic diversity and environmental adaptability but also provide new perspectives and tools for assessing and managing environmental health risks.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Interdisciplinary Perspectives in Research</h3>
            <p>The deep interpretation of SNP data requires not only genetic expertise but also interdisciplinary perspectives from archaeology, history, and sociology. By integrating knowledge from these fields with SNP data, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic imprints of human history.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>As a link between genetics, environment, and history, the study and application of SNPs not only deepen our understanding of genetic diversity and environmental adaptability but also provide new perspectives and tools for assessing and managing environmental health risks.</p>
