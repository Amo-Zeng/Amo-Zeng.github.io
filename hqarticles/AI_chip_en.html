            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>AI chips, as the core hardware support for artificial intelligence technology, are undergoing a profound transformation. Traditionally, AI chips have been viewed as accelerators for high-performance computing, focusing on enhancing computational power to handle complex AI models and massive data processing needs. However, with the rapid development and widespread application of AI technology, the role of AI chips is no longer limited to being mere "computation" tools. Instead, they are gradually evolving into bridges connecting the physical world and the digital world, taking on multiple roles such as perception, understanding, decision-making, and action. Meanwhile, the design of AI chips is also evolving from single architectures to hybrid architectures to address the increasingly complex needs of application scenarios. More importantly, the development of AI chips is shifting from "technology-driven" to "scenario-driven," achieving real-world applications through deep optimization and customized designs.</p>

            <h2>The Diversified Role of AI Chips: From "Computation" to "Intelligent Bridge"</h2>
            <h3>From "Computation" to "Perception"</h3>
            <p>Traditional AI chip design focused more on improving computational efficiency, such as matrix operations and data parallel processing. However, in practical applications, AI systems not only need to handle digital computations but also need to perceive information from the physical world and understand its meaning. For example, in smart homes, AI chips embedded in smart speakers not only need voice recognition capabilities but also need to perceive the user's voice, tone, and even emotions, and understand the user's command intent. This "perception" capability requires AI chips to have signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and pattern recognition functions, thus driving smart home systems to automatically adjust the environment.</p>
            <h3>From "Computation" to "Understanding"</h3>
            <p>AI chips not only need to perceive the physical world but also need to "understand" it to make correct decisions and actions. In the field of autonomous driving, AI chips are not only accelerators for image recognition but also the中枢 for real-time traffic analysis and driving decision-making. They need to process large amounts of data from cameras, radars, LiDAR, and other sensors, understand the road environment, vehicle status, and other information represented by this data, and make safe driving decisions.</p>
            <h3>From "Computation" to "Action"</h3>
            <p>Ultimately, the mission of AI chips is to transform "perception" and "understanding" into "action." For example, in industrial automation, AI chips can monitor the running status of production lines in real-time and automatically adjust machine parameters based on preset rules to optimize the production process. In the medical field, AI chips can assist doctors in disease diagnosis and provide personalized treatment plans.</p>

            <h2>From "Single Architecture" to "Hybrid Architecture": The Evolution of AI Chips</h2>
            <h3>Limitations of Single Architecture</h3>
            <p>With the increasing complexity of AI application scenarios, the limitations of single architectures are becoming more apparent. Early AI chip designs often used single architectures such as GPUs, FPGAs, or ASICs to optimize performance for specific tasks. However, single architectures have significant shortcomings in task adaptability, resource utilization, and development cycles. Therefore, AI chip design is moving towards hybrid architectures, achieving more efficient and flexible computing architectures through heterogeneous computing and in-memory computing technologies.</p>
            <h3>Heterogeneous Computing: Initial Exploration of Hybrid Architectures</h3>
            <p>Heterogeneous computing integrates multiple computing units (such as CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, NPUs, etc.) and dynamically allocates computing resources based on task needs, thereby maximizing efficiency. The advantages of heterogeneous computing lie in strong task adaptability, high resource optimization utilization, and enhanced development flexibility, but its design complexity also significantly increases, especially in communication between computing units, task scheduling, and power management.</p>
            <h3>In-Memory Computing: Breaking the von Neumann Bottleneck</h3>
            <p>In traditional computer architectures, the separation of storage and computing units leads to the "memory wall" problem. In-memory computing technology combines storage and computing units closely, reducing data transmission latency and power consumption. This technology is particularly suitable for big data processing and deep learning tasks, significantly improving energy efficiency and real-time performance, but its design and implementation still face many challenges.</p>
            <h3>Future Prospects of Hybrid Architectures</h3>
            <p>In the future, AI chips may combine heterogeneous computing with in-memory computing technologies to build more efficient and flexible computing architectures. For example, integrating multiple computing units on the same chip and optimizing data transmission and processing efficiency through in-memory computing technology. Additionally, AI chips may have adaptive capabilities, dynamically adjusting the computing architecture based on task needs to achieve optimal performance.</p>

            <h2>From "Technology-Driven" to "Scenario-Driven": The Breakthrough Path of AI Chips</h2>
            <h3>Limitations of Technology-Driven Approaches</h3>
            <p>With the widespread application of AI technology, relying solely on technological progress is no longer sufficient to meet the diverse market demands. Traditional AI chips like GPUs, although excellent in general computing capabilities, often fall short in efficiency for specific scenarios. Moreover, as process technology advances, the marginal benefits of technological progress are diminishing, and the increase in cost and power consumption is becoming more evident.</p>
            <h3>Advantages of Scenario-Driven Approaches</h3>
            <p>Scenario-driven means that AI chip design will be more aligned with actual application needs. By deeply optimizing for specific industries and application scenarios, AI chips can significantly reduce power consumption and costs while maintaining performance. For example, in the field of medical imaging analysis, specialized AI chips can improve the accuracy and speed of image recognition by optimizing image processing algorithms and architectural designs. In the financial risk control field, AI chips developed for the characteristics of financial data processing can achieve real-time risk assessment and early warning, enhancing the risk control capabilities of financial institutions.</p>
            <h3>The Rise of Customized AI Chips</h3>
            <p>In the future, customized AI chips will become an important trend. By deeply optimizing for specific industries and application scenarios, customized AI chips can better meet diverse market demands and achieve real-world applications. For example, specialized AI chips for autonomous driving, medical imaging, and financial risk control will achieve a better balance between performance, power consumption, and cost.</p>
            <h3>Building an Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>The development of scenario-driven AI chips relies on a complete ecosystem. In the future, AI chip manufacturers need to closely collaborate with industry users, software developers, and other stakeholders to build a comprehensive ecosystem covering hardware, software, and applications, promoting the widespread adoption of AI technology.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The role of AI chips is transforming from merely "computation" tools to bridges connecting the physical world and the digital world, and their design is evolving from single architectures to hybrid architectures. More importantly, the development of AI chips is shifting from "technology-driven" to "scenario-driven." Through deep optimization and customized design, AI chips will better meet diverse market demands and achieve real-world applications. In the future, with the rise of customized AI chips and the construction of an ecosystem, AI technology will usher in an even broader application prospect, bringing more intelligent and efficient living experiences to human society.</p>
