            <h2>The Potential and Challenges of Gene Editing Education</h2>
            <p>Gene editing technology, one of the most disruptive scientific breakthroughs of the 21st century, is profoundly transforming fields such as medicine, agriculture, and environmental conservation. However, with the widespread application of tools like CRISPR-Cas9, the ethical, social, and cultural challenges posed by this technology are becoming increasingly apparent. Gene editing education not only bears the responsibility of cultivating the next generation of problem solvers but also must address conflicts between different cultures and value systems in a global context. This article aims to delve into the potential and challenges of gene editing education, particularly the opportunities in interdisciplinary thinking, public engagement, and transnational ethical dialogue, and to promote the sustainable development of this field through education.</p>

            <h3>Fostering Interdisciplinary Global Problem Solvers</h3>
            <p>The complexity of gene editing technology requires the integration of interdisciplinary knowledge. However, the limitations of the traditional education system, such as single-track curricula, inadequate laboratory resources, and insufficient faculty, limit students' comprehensive understanding of this cutting-edge technology. Gene editing education has tremendous potential to cultivate students' innovative potential and global perspective through interdisciplinary education, thereby addressing future global challenges.</p>
            <h4>Cultivating Interdisciplinary Thinking</h4>
            <p>Gene editing technology involves not only biology but also closely relates to disciplines such as artificial intelligence, data science, and ethics. By integrating these fields of knowledge, students can design more efficient gene editing tools, analyze massive genetic data, and even develop AI-based gene therapies. This interdisciplinary educational model not only enhances students' scientific literacy but also fosters their ability to solve complex problems. For example, by combining biology with artificial intelligence, students can develop more precise gene editing algorithms; by integrating biology with data science, they can analyze the potential patterns in gene editing data, thereby advancing scientific research.</p>
            <h4>Stimulating Innovative Potential</h4>
            <p>Another crucial goal of gene editing education is to stimulate students' innovative potential, enabling them to become future scientific leaders. Through participation in gene editing experiments, students can experience the process of scientific research firsthand, cultivating their independent thinking and problem-solving abilities. For example, students can design gene therapies to address specific genetic diseases or use gene editing technology to improve crops and enhance food production, tackling global food security challenges. This practical learning model not only strengthens students' hands-on skills but also allows them to apply their knowledge in real-world contexts, enhancing their overall competence.</p>
            <h4>Addressing Global Challenges</h4>
            <p>Gene editing technology offers solutions to global challenges. For instance, it can be used to improve crop yields through gene editing, alleviating the global food crisis; it can also protect endangered species through gene editing, maintaining biodiversity and promoting environmental protection. One of the goals of gene editing education is to prepare talent to address these future global challenges. By incorporating global issues into the curriculum, students can better understand the social value of gene editing technology, thus contributing to global sustainable development in their future careers.</p>

            <h3>Case Study: Interactive Gene Editing Learning Platforms</h3>
            <p>To better understand the potential of gene editing education, we can look at some successful examples. For instance, developing interactive gene editing learning platforms that allow students to simulate the design of gene therapies to solve real-world problems. Such platforms can not only help students master gene editing technology but also cultivate their teamwork and project management skills. Through this practical learning approach, students can not only grasp the theoretical knowledge of gene editing but also improve their practical skills through simulated experiments, laying a solid foundation for their future research or career paths.</p>

            <h2>Gene Editing Education and Public Engagement: Guiding Rational Discussion</h2>
            <p>The widespread application of gene editing technology has sparked complex emotions among the public. On one hand, people are filled with anticipation for its potential, believing it can cure genetic diseases, improve crops, and protect the environment; on the other hand, they are concerned about the risks it may pose, such as genetic discrimination and "designer babies." This polarization of emotions often leads to a lack of rationality in public discussions about gene editing technology, easily resulting in misunderstandings and panic.</p>
            <h3>The Complexity of Ethical and Social Issues</h3>
            <p>The application of gene editing technology involves multiple layers of ethical and social issues. For example, genetic discrimination could lead to the misuse of technology, exacerbating social inequality and discrimination; "designer babies" raise profound ethical challenges related to human dignity and equal rights. Public understanding of these issues is often limited to media coverage, lacking systematic scientific knowledge and ethical frameworks, making it difficult for discussions to delve deeply. Therefore, an important task of gene editing education is to convey scientific knowledge about gene editing to the public through popular science education, helping them understand the technology's scientific nature and limitations.</p>
            <h3>Popular Science Education and Ethical Framework Development</h3>
            <p>To guide public rational participation in discussions about gene editing technology, gene editing education must emphasize popular science education and the development of ethical frameworks. Through systematic education, the public can better recognize the scientific nature and limitations
