            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Tonality, as a core concept in music theory, not only plays a crucial role in traditional music but also demonstrates its unique diversity and innovation in modern music creation and cross-cultural interaction. This article delves into the cross-cultural analysis of tonality, its innovative applications in modern music production, and its connection to mental health, revealing the multifaceted dimensions of tonality in musical expression and cultural exchange.</p>

            <h3>Cross-Cultural Tonality Analysis</h3>
            <p>Music, as a means of human emotional and cultural expression, exhibits a rich variety of forms in tonality across different cultural contexts. Tonality is not just a theoretical concept; it is deeply embedded in culture, history, and social structures.</p>
            <h4>Western Culture</h4>
            <p>In Western musical traditions, the major and minor key systems dominate. Major keys are often seen as symbols of brightness and happiness, while minor keys represent melancholy and sadness. For example, Beethoven's "Fifth Symphony" with its famous fate motif uses minor keys to convey inner struggle and ultimate triumph. The stability and functional harmony of the Western tonal system give its emotional expressions a clear direction.</p>
            <h4>Eastern Culture</h4>
            <p>Asian musical cultures show different tonal concepts. Chinese music emphasizes the pentatonic scale, which has a cyclic and open nature, giving a sense of tranquility and naturalness. The Indian Raga system is even more complex, where tonality is not just a collection of notes but also an expression of emotion and time, with each raga having specific times for performance and associated emotions, reflecting the close connection between music and life.</p>
            <h4>African Culture</h4>
            <p>African music is renowned for its rhythmic complexity, but its tonality is also distinctive. Many traditional African musics use pentatonic or hexatonic scales, emphasizing repetition and variation in melody. Here, tonality functions more as an interaction of rhythm and melody rather than Western-style harmony. This highlights the functionality and interactivity of tonality in African music.</p>

            <h3>Innovative Applications of Tonality in Modern Music Production</h3>
            <p>In modern music production, particularly in genres like electronic music and film scoring, the application of tonality has transcended traditional frameworks to create unique emotional atmospheres and narrative contexts. The rise of electronic music has provided new tools and possibilities for tonality.</p>
            <h4>Case Studies of Innovative Applications</h4>
            <p><strong>Tonality Innovation in Electronic Music</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Works by Hans Zimmer</strong>: In his film scores, like "Inception," Zimmer uses melodic themes combined with Brahmsian harmony and electronic effects to create an atmosphere of suspense and dreaminess.</li>
                <li><strong>Daft Punk's "Random Access Memories"</strong>: This album combines retro tonal elements with modern electronic music technology to evoke a musical experience where nostalgia coexists with a futuristic feel. For instance, "Instant Crush" uses typical pop tonality but through electronic instruments, making the melody lines sound more blurred and diffuse.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Application of Tonality in Film Scoring</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>John Williams's "Star Wars" Series</strong>: Although a classic example, its tonal treatment remains innovative.</li>
                <li><strong>Clint Mansell's "Moon"</strong>: In this film, Mansell uses a single tonal base with electronic instruments to create an atmosphere of loneliness and exploration of the unknown.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Connection Between Tonality and Mental Health</h3>
            <p>Tonality is not only significant in music composition but also closely linked to human mental health. The field of music psychology has consistently focused on the relationship between tonality and emotion.</p>
            <h4>Research Background</h4>
            <p>From historical reviews to modern studies, the impact of tonality on emotions has been scientifically validated. Research shows that specific tonalities significantly influence psychological states, providing new avenues for music therapy and mood regulation.</p>
            <h4>Specific Tonality Analysis</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>C Major</strong>: Often considered the "purest" tonality, offering openness and brightness.</li>
                <li><strong>A Minor</strong>: Relative to C Major, it carries melancholy and introspection.</li>
                <li><strong>E Minor</strong>: Regarded as one of the saddest tonalities, yet with a sense of solemnity.</li>
                <li><strong>F Major</strong>: Possesses warmth and comfort.</li>
            </ul>
