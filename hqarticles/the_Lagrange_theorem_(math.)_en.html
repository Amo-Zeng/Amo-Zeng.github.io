            <h2>Introduction: The History and Impact of Lagrange's Theorem</h2>
            <p>Lagrange's Theorem, a brilliant gem in the history of mathematics, originated during the mathematical renaissance of 18th-century Europe. During this period, the主导研究 from Greek geometry to more abstract and general fields of algebra and analysis. The Italian-born mathematician Lagrange made significant contributions to analytical mechanics, number theory, algebra, and calculus. His theorem not only reveals the structure of groups and the relationship between subgroups, deepening the understanding of group theory in algebra, but also provides an important tool for solving practical problems, with far-reaching theoretical significance and practical value that is still widely studied and applied today.</p>

            <h3>Multi-dimensional Applications of Lagrange's Theorem in Modern Science and Engineering</h3>
            <p>Lagrange's Theorem has not only had a profound impact within the field of mathematics, but its applications in modern science and engineering have also become increasingly widespread. In physics, Lagrange's Theorem provides a powerful framework for describing the dynamic behavior of systems. By defining the Lagrangian of a system (the difference between kinetic and potential energy), scientists can use Lagrange's equations to derive the equations of motion, which is widely applied in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and relativity.</p>
