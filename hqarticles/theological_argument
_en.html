"Shù Jiǎ" (数甲) can be translated into English as "**Mathematics A**" or "**Level A Mathematics**", depending on the context.

In the context of **Taiwan's college entrance exams** (similar to the Gaokao in mainland China), "数甲" refers to the more advanced level of mathematics required for students applying to **science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)** programs. It is sometimes translated as:

- **Mathematics A**
- **Advanced Mathematics**
- **Higher Level Mathematics**

Likewise:
- **数乙 (Shù Yǐ)** — Mathematics B, often for liberal arts or social science majors, and is less advanced than 数甲.

If you’re referring to a different context (e.g., a math problem using “甲” as a label for a person or group), please provide more details and I can tailor the translation accordingly.
