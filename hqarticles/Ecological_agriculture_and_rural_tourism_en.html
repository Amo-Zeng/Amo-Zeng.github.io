            <h2>From "Experience Economy" to "Co-Creation Economy": Building an Ecological Closed Loop for Urban-Rural Integration</h2>
            <p>Over the past two decades, the global economy has undergone a profound transformation from the "commodity economy" to the "experience economy." Consumers are no longer satisfied with simple material consumption but seek unique and unforgettable experiences. However, as the experience economy becomes more widespread, homogenization becomes increasingly severe, and the driving force for consumption upgrading gradually weakens. At the same time, the imbalance in urban-rural development and the insufficient intrinsic motivation in rural areas have become more prominent, posing a bottleneck to the comprehensive development of the economy and society. Against this backdrop, the "co-creation economy" has emerged, reshaping value creation methods and providing new ideas for urban-rural integration. Through the deep empowerment of technology and culture, an ecological closed loop for urban-rural co-creation is gradually forming, opening up new paths for achieving common prosperity and sustainable development.</p>

            <h3>I. From "Landscape Creation" to "Story Mining": Cultural Empowerment in Rural Tourism and Ecological Agriculture</h3>
            <p>Traditional rural tourism and ecological agriculture models often rely on "landscape creation," attracting tourists by beautifying the natural environment and building infrastructure. Although this approach can bring economic benefits in the short term, it tends to be homogeneous, lacking depth and sustainability. As consumer demand evolves, rural tourism and ecological agriculture must shift from "landscape creation" to "story mining," empowering through culture to create unique and attractive tourist destinations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limitations of Landscape Creation:</strong> Homogenization in landscape creation is severe, and over-reliance can lead to resource waste and environmental damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Value of Story Mining:</strong> Every place has its unique cultural stories. By mining these stories, rural tourism and ecological agriculture can be endowed with unique cultural significance.</li>
                <li><strong>Practical Applications of Cultural Empowerment:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mining Local Stories: Enhance tourists' cultural identity through tour guides and cultural activities.</li>
                        <li>Creating Cultural Experiences: Organize cultural festivals and folk performances to increase interaction and engagement.</li>
                        <li>Developing Cultural Products: Integrate cultural elements into tourism products to enhance their cultural value.</li>
                        <li>Protecting Cultural Heritage: Establish mechanisms for cultural heritage protection, encouraging local residents to participate.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Case Study:</strong> The Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennial in Japan has enhanced the appeal of rural tourism and promoted local ecological agriculture through cultural empowerment.</p>

            <h3>II. From "Unidirectional Output" to "Bidirectional Flow": Technology Empowerment in Rural Revitalization</h3>
            <p>Traditional rural development models often involve a "unidirectional output" from cities to rural areas, with resources, capital, and technology primarily flowing from cities. Rural feedback and participation are limited. With the rapid development of technology, especially the widespread use of digital technology, rural revitalization is shifting from "unidirectional output" to "bidirectional flow." By empowering through technology, this shift promotes balanced resource flow between urban and rural areas and stimulates rural intrinsic motivation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Meaning and Significance of Technology Empowerment:</strong> Technology empowerment involves not only the application of technical tools but also a profound transformation of rural development models.</li>
                <li><strong>Specific Pathways of Technology Empowerment:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Building Digital Infrastructure: Enable real-time information exchange between urban and rural areas, enhancing rural digitalization.</li>
                        <li>Applying Agricultural Technology: Promote the use of intelligent agricultural equipment to improve production efficiency.</li>
                        <li>Developing Rural E-commerce: Use e-commerce platforms to achieve precise production and supply of agricultural products.</li>
                        <li>Training and Innovation: Establish mechanisms for rural technology talent training, encouraging youth to return and start businesses.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Case Study:</strong> Anji, Zhejiang, has enhanced the market competitiveness of its tea industry through digital rural construction; Wuxi, Jiangsu, has diversified rural economies through smart agricultural technology.</p>

            <h3>III. Building an Ecological Closed Loop for Urban-Rural Co-Creation</h3>
            <p>The "co-creation economy" emphasizes that consumers shift from being passive recipients to active participants, co-creating value with businesses and society. Against the backdrop of urban-rural integration, the co-creation economy provides new ideas for breaking the urban-rural dual structure and achieving common prosperity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Realistic Significance of Urban-Rural Co-Creation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Overcoming Urban-Rural Gaps: Address urban-rural disparities through interaction and resource sharing.</li>
                        <li>Capitalizing on Consumption Upgrading: Meet personalized and customized demands, creating unique value.</li>
                        <li>Empowered by Digital Economy: Drive urban-rural co-creation through digital technology.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Building an Ecological Closed Loop:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creating "Co-Creation Platforms": Connect urban-rural resources through digital platforms and physical spaces.</li>
                        <li>Cultivating "Co-Creation Subjects": Guide businesses and farmers to participate in co-creation, enhancing their capabilities.</li>
                        <li>Establishing "Co-Creation Mechanisms": Develop profit-sharing mechanisms to drive a virtuous cycle of urban-rural co-creation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Case Implications:</strong> Japan's "Satoyama Model," Taiwan's "Community Building," and China's "Pinduoduo Model" offer valuable lessons for urban-rural co-creation.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>From "experience economy" to "co-creation economy," from "landscape creation" to "story mining," and from "unidirectional output" to "bidirectional flow," the path of urban-rural integration is undergoing profound changes. Through technological empowerment and cultural exploration, an ecological closed loop for urban-rural co-creation is gradually taking shape, providing new possibilities for achieving urban-rural integration and common prosperity. In the future, it will require collaboration among government, businesses, and society to explore and practice, ultimately realizing the vision of urban-rural integration and common prosperity.</p>
