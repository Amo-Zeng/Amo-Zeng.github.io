            <h2>Introduction: The Prism Effect of Biotechnology</h2>
            <p>When the CRISPR-Cas9 scissors cut through the DNA double helix, human civilization is undergoing an unprecedented reshaping of life forms. In three seemingly separate spaces—laboratories, farms, and hospitals—gene editing technology is simultaneously rewriting the natural laws in three dimensions: ecological restoration projects to save endangered species, agricultural revolutions to reconstruct the food chain, and medical practices to push the limits of treatment. These three application scenarios form a complete ethical spectrum, reflecting the complex interaction between technological innovation and bioethics. Based on the latest technological advancements and cross-cultural ethical research, this article constructs a comprehensive evaluation framework for the era of gene editing.</p>

            <h2>I. Technological Synergy Network: From Tool Sharing to Risk Resonance</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Cross-Domain Migration of Core Technologies</h3>
            <p>Genome editing tools exhibit significant platform effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tool Universality:</strong> Single-base editing technologies (e.g., Prime Editing) have achieved breakthroughs in conservation (Northern White Rhino gene repair), agriculture (low-purine cattle breeding), and medicine (sickle cell anemia treatment).</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency Leap:</strong> A 2023 study in <em>Cell</em> shows that the new Cas12a system has increased editing efficiency by an average of 3.7 times across these fields.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Curve:</strong> Editing costs show a "double exponential decline"—technical costs halve every 16 months, while the learning curve reduces operation time by 30% annually.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <h2>Final Thoughts: Between Editing and Reverence</h2>
            <p>Gene editing technology has thrust humanity into the new role of "evolutionary engineers." In our hands, we hold not just molecular scissors but the scepter to reshape the code of life. In this era of exponential technological growth, the more important questions are not "can we edit," but "what should we edit" and "who decides."</p>
            <p>Perhaps we need to establish a new ethical coordinate system—where the vertical axis represents the gradient of technological innovation, the horizontal axis marks the strength of ethical constraints, and each application scenario is a dynamic vector on this plane. As the ancient Chinese wisdom of "entering the forest with an axe at the right time" suggests, true technological civilization lies not in breaking all boundaries but in understanding which ones must be upheld.</p>
            <p>In the next thirty years, gene editing will face three critical turning points: 2028 (commercialization of xenotransplantation), 2035 (completion of the global genome database), and 2042 (first gene-driven ecosystem transformation). Before reaching these milestones, humanity must evolve from being mere operators of technology to ecological philosophers—because ultimately, what we are editing is not just base sequences but the paradigm of coexistence between civilization and nature.</p>
