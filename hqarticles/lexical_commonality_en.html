            <h2>Language is not only the carrier of culture but also the reflection of cognition</h2>
            <p>In the evolution of human civilization, the process of lexical universalization reveals deep cultural exchanges and the uniformity of human cognition. This article will explore the resonance between language, cognition, and culture from three dimensions: the historical origins of lexical universals, cognitive uniformity, and the relationship between lexical form and meaning.</p>

            <h3>I. Cultural Transmission and the Historical Context of Lexical Universals</h3>
            <p>The universalization of vocabulary often begins with the initial stages of cultural transmission. Take "tea" as an example. The universalization process of this word in different languages profoundly reflects the historical landscape of global cultural interactions.</p>
            <p>In Persian, "tea" is called "چای" (chay); in Arabic, it is "شاي" (shay); and in Russian, it is "чай" (chai). The universality of these words is no coincidence but a natural outcome of the cultural transmission chain.</p>

            <h3>II. Cross-Cultural Trade and the Two-Way Interaction of Lexical Universals</h3>
            <p>Cross-cultural trade is a significant force driving the universalization of vocabulary. Taking "tea" as an example, as tea trade expanded, expressions for "tea" in different languages gradually converged, reflecting the two-way interaction between trade and language.</p>
            <p>For instance, when the Dutch introduced tea to Europe in the 17th century, they directly borrowed the Chinese pronunciation "茶" (cha), forming words like "tea" in English and "thé" in French.</p>

            <h3>III. Religious Transmission and the Spiritual Bond of Lexical Universals</h3>
            <p>Religious transmission is another significant path for the universalization of vocabulary. Taking the spread of Buddhism as an example, many Buddhist terms were directly borrowed into Chinese, such as "涅槃" (niè pán), "菩萨" (pú sà), and "因果" (yīn guǒ).</p>
            <p>As Buddhism further spread, these terms were also borrowed into other languages, such as "涅槃" (ねはん, nehan) in Japanese and "부처" (bucheo) in Korean.</p>

            <h3>IV. Cross-Cultural Universals of Color Terms and Cognitive Uniformity</h3>
            <p>The universalization of color terms not only reflects historical cultural exchanges but also reveals the uniformity of human cognition. Berlin and Kay's research shows that basic color terms in various languages follow the sequence "black/white → red → green/yellow → blue → brown → purple/pink/orange/gray".</p>

            <h3>V. Chinese Characters: The Deep Connection Between Form and Meaning</h3>
            <p>Chinese characters, as a unique writing system combining visual symbols and phonetic information, demonstrate a deep connection between lexical form and meaning. Phonetic-semantic characters, combining radical and phonetic components, expand the expressive power of vocabulary.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The universalization of vocabulary is an inevitable result of cultural exchange, reflecting the interaction and integration of human civilizations. In the future process of globalization, the universalization of vocabulary will continue to serve as an important bridge for cultural exchange, promoting deep integration and development among different civilizations.</p>
