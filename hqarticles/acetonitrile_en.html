            <h3>Bio-based Nitriles: Dawn of Green Chemistry</h3>
            <p>With environmental issues becoming increasingly severe, bio-based nitriles, as an essential part of green chemistry, are leading the chemical industry towards a more sustainable future with their unique advantages.</p>
            <h4>1. Sustainable Raw Materials:</h4>
            <p>The raw materials for bio-based nitriles primarily come from renewable biomass resources such as plant oils and agricultural waste. These materials are widely available and renewable, effectively reducing reliance on non-renewable resources like petroleum and achieving sustainable development from the source.</p>
            <h4>2. Low-carbon and Environmentally Friendly Production Processes:</h4>
            <p>The production of bio-based nitriles typically employs more environmentally friendly biocatalytic technologies or green chemical synthesis routes. Compared to traditional petroleum-based nitrile production processes, these methods significantly reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, minimizing environmental pollution and aligning with the core principles of green chemistry.</p>
            <h4>3. Diversified High-value Applications:</h4>
            <p>As an important chemical intermediate, bio-based nitriles are widely used in synthetic fibers, engineering plastics, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and other fields. For example, bio-based acrylonitrile can replace traditional petroleum-based acrylonitrile for producing environmentally friendly acrylic fibers and ABS resin; bio-based adiponitrile can be used to produce nylon 66, which is widely applied in automotive and electronics industries.</p>

            <h3>Health Risks and Safety Management: The Double-edged Sword of Nitriles</h3>
            <p>Despite the significant potential of nitriles in renewable energy and green chemistry, their high reactivity and potential toxicity pose certain risks to human health and environmental safety during their use and production, which must be given high priority.</p>
            <h4>1. Health Risks:</h4>
            <p>Nitriles generally possess high acute toxicity and potential chronic toxicity, primarily entering the human body through inhalation, skin contact, and ingestion. Common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, respiratory difficulties, and arrhythmias, with severe cases potentially leading to central nervous system suppression, cardiovascular failure, and even death.</p>
            <h4>2. Toxicological Mechanism:</h4>
            <p>The toxicity of nitriles mainly stems from the cyanide group (-CN) in their molecular structure. The cyanide group has high reactivity, capable of binding with key enzymes and receptors in cells, disrupting normal physiological functions, leading to cellular respiration inhibition, cardiovascular system effects, and toxic metabolic products.</p>
            <h4>3. Safety Management Measures:</h4>
            <p>To reduce the health risks of nitriles, it is necessary to implement scientific risk assessments, engineering controls, personal protective measures, and emergency response plans to ensure their safe and controllable application in sustainable development.</p>
