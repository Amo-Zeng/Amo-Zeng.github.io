            <h3>AFM: The Precise Navigator of the Microscopic World</h3>
            <p>The extraordinary capability of AFM lies in its ability to <strong>observe, manipulate, and measure</strong> biological molecules and material structures in real-time, with <strong>atomic-level precision</strong>. Unlike traditional optical microscopes, AFM surpasses the optical diffraction limit by leveraging the interaction forces between the probe and the sample, opening the door to the molecular world.</p>
            <p>In the field of <strong>molecular biology</strong>, AFM not only "sees" but also "touches" and "measures." For instance, by precisely measuring the mechanical properties of proteins, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of their deformation and interactions during signal transduction, uncovering the molecular mechanisms of life activities. This "visible and tangible" capability makes AFM a powerful tool for exploring the mysteries of life.</p>
            <p>In the field of <strong>medicine</strong>, AFM's high-resolution imaging capabilities make it a powerful tool for studying the interactions between pathogens and host cells. By observing how viruses invade cells and how bacteria adhere to cell surfaces, researchers can gain a more accurate understanding of the mechanisms of diseases and develop more targeted treatment strategies. Additionally, AFM technology shows great potential in <strong>personalized medicine</strong>. By measuring the mechanical properties of specific proteins in a patient's body, doctors can obtain unique information about the patient's condition and tailor treatment plans to individual differences.</p>
