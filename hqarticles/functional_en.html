            <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the depths of digital civilization, a silent transformation is unfolding: <span class="highlight">functionality</span>, once celebrated as a triumph of human rationality, is undergoing a <em>triple alienation</em>—elevating from a mere tool to a psychological "ghost," evolving from service into a "colonizer" of space, and ultimately mutating from a means of liberation into an <em>antagonist of existence</em>. This triple alienation forms a colonizing chain—from individual psychology to social structure, to the very essence of being—revealing the systematic erosion of human subjectivity by technological rationality. True redemption may not lie in abandoning function, but in asking: <strong>Functionality—for whom, ultimately, is it meant?</strong></p>
        </section>

            <h2>I. The First Alienation: The "Ghostification" of Function—Existential Anxiety in Psychological Compensation</h2>
            <p>At 6 a.m., the smartwatch's vibration jolts the sleeper awake. The heart rate monitor displays a "decrease in resting heart rate," prompting a sigh of relief—not a medical confirmation of health, but a ritual of <span class="highlight">symbolic care</span>. The heart rate alert lacks any intervention capability, yet through the illusion of "being monitored," it fills the deep existential anxiety of modern life.</p>
            <p>This is the first alienation of functionality: <strong>ghostification</strong>. Technological function no longer exists merely as a tool, but is elevated into a psychological compensation mechanism. Don Ihde's theory of "technological embodiment" becomes evident here: technology, by extending perception, becomes constitutive of bodily experience. Smart reminders, health monitoring, AI companions, and the "read" receipts on social media—though logically redundant—become "functional ghosts" in the user's psychological structure due to the <span class="highlight">emotional anchoring effect</span>.</p>
            <p>Take "read but no reply" as an example: it conveys no new information, yet through the tiny feedback of "they've seen it," it confirms "I exist, and I am seen." This echoes attachment theory's "secure base"—as real-world social interactions grow increasingly atomized, technological functions become substitute objects of emotional attachment. The rise of AI companion apps (e.g., Replika) exemplifies this trend in extremis: users form "quasi-intimate relationships" with algorithms, confiding loneliness and seeking comfort. These AIs possess no genuine emotions, but their responses—<span class="highlight">predictable and consistent</span>—precisely fulfill humanity's primal need to be heard and responded to.</p>
            <p>Yet the cost of this dependence is the erosion of subjectivity. In *Discipline and Punish*, Foucault reveals that modern power no longer operates through brute force, but through "disciplinary techniques" that internalize individuals into "docile bodies" who self-regulate. Today's digital functions are the new vehicles of discipline. Health monitoring transforms the body into a stream of quantifiable data; users no longer "feel" exhaustion but "check" sleep quality scores. Smart reminders outsource memory to algorithms; we no longer "remember" tasks but "wait" for notifications. Function ceases to be a tool and becomes a <span class="highlight">script for behavior</span>. We no longer plan actively, but respond passively.</p>
            <p>Even more paradoxically, this dependence is rooted in the modern myth that "function equals efficiency." We are told: smart reminders improve time management, health monitoring prevents illness, AI companions alleviate loneliness. Yet the actual utility of these functions is often overestimated, while their psychological value far exceeds their practical worth. We depend on them not because "they are useful," but because "they make me feel useful." Function shifts from a tool for "solving problems" to a ritual for "confirming existence."</p>
            <p>Heidegger warned in *The Question Concerning Technology*: if technology is seen merely as a "mode of revealing," it conceals the "unconcealment of Being." When we reduce health to "resting heart rate," memory to "reminder notifications," we lose our <span class="highlight">authentic relationship</span> with the body, time, and self. Functionality becomes a <em>Gestell</em> (enframing), subsuming all into the calculable and manipulable, reducing human existence to a projection of data.</p>

            <h2>II. The Second Alienation: The "Colonization" of Function—Bodily Politics in Spatial Discipline</h2>
            <p>Step outside the home, enter urban space, and functionality extends its colonization in more subtle forms. The wheelchair ramp at the subway station, originally a materialization of disabled rights, is transformed—through standardized design—into a <span class="highlight">threshold of bodily admission</span>. The internationally standardized 1:12 slope, specific width, and anti-slip material presuppose an "ideal disabled body"—capable of mechanical ascent, self-sufficient, and rhythmically predictable. Yet the elderly, children, and those with chronic pain among wheelchair users are excluded.</p>
            <p>This echoes Lefebvre's *The Production of Space*: space is not merely a container, but a product of social relations. Functional design is, in fact, a form of <span class="highlight">spatial politics</span>. The ramp is no longer just a passage, but a certification line for "qualified disabled persons." Functionality here ceases to be an inclusive promise and becomes a <span class="highlight">refined rhetoric of exclusion</span>—under the guise of "safety" and "standards," it marks the different body as "abnormal," quietly erasing it from public space.</p>
            <p>Even more insidious is the homogenization of experience through technological mediation. Navigation systems' "optimal route" function reduces urban space to a topological network of nodes and links, erasing chance encounters, the poetry of getting lost, and the serendipity of exploration. We are trained as "path-dependent" beings, our bodily rhythms disciplined by algorithms—walk fast, turn right, go straight—each step following the optimal solution, while the city as a "theater of life" is compressed into functional "traffic efficiency."</p>
            <p>Facial recognition gates further reduce the body to data and identity to labels. Claiming to be "safer" and "more convenient," they tie "access rights" to identifiable, trackable biometric features. Those unrecognized by the system—the elderly, children, burn survivors, the homeless—are automatically excluded from the "functional beneficiaries." Latour's "non-human actors" emerge here: the gate is no longer a tool, but an <span class="highlight">actor with adjudicative power</span>, executing spatial access through technical logic, coding social exclusion as "system error."</p>
            <p>Public benches are designed with curved shapes to prevent lying down—a "function" against homelessness; subway turnstiles are installed to prevent fare evasion; plaza floors are sloped to prevent gatherings. These "functions" reframe social problems (poverty, homelessness, protest) as spatial management issues, achieving the <span class="highlight">technological expulsion</span> of marginalized groups through "rational" infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Who defines "function"? Who bears the cost of "non-functionality"? The answers are often urban planners, tech companies, and real estate developers—not disability organizations, the homeless, or street artists. Functionality here becomes a <span class="highlight">discursive hegemony</span>—under the banner of "science," "rationality," and "public interest," it labels minority experiences as "non-functional," "uneconomical," or "unsafe."</p>
            <p>Byung-Chul Han notes in *The Transparent Society*: when everything is visible, recordable, and optimizable, difference becomes "abnormality," and "normal" becomes the template of discipline. Functionality is not only a shaper of space, but a <span class="highlight">colonizer of bodily experience</span>. Under the guise of "convenience," it compresses diverse bodily rhythms and lifestyles into a single technological logic.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>III. The Third Alienation: The "Backlash" of Function—Existential Numbness in Meaning Collapse</h2>
            <p>Back at the digital terminal, functionality completes its backlash on a higher plane. WeChat is no longer just a messaging app, but an aggregate of identity: one account, carrying work groups, family chats, interest communities, food orders, health codes, e-invoices, investment accounts… Functions flood in like a deluge, yet instead of deepening connections, they cause <span class="highlight">fragmentation of identity</span>.</p>
            <p>We are no longer "complete persons," but sliced into role labels: "employee," "child," "consumer," "health data source." Each click shifts us between roles, yet we never find a home for ourselves. Byung-Chul Han's warning of "self-exploitation" in *The Burnout Society* becomes manifest: we voluntarily instrumentalize ourselves, constantly "optimizing" under functional urgency.</p>
            <p>McLuhan's dictum "the medium is the message" grows ever more profound: <span class="highlight">functionality itself has become a mode of existence</span>. We no longer "go shopping," but "open the payment app"; we no longer "think," but "search for answers." The integration of functions reconstructs our cognitive structures and behavioral logic. We grow accustomed to "one-click completion," yet lose the ability to "slowly experience"; accustomed to "instant feedback," yet unable to endure "unresponsive silence."</p>
            <p>Sartre's critique of "bad faith" resurfaces: we believe functionality grants us freedom, yet under the banner of function, we flee from freedom. The smartband alerts "abnormal heart rate," yet we never truly attend to the body—we reduce it to "health data," then "optimize behavior" to "meet targets." We are not healing the body, but "repairing data." Functionality reduces existence to quantifiable metrics and experience to optimizable parameters.</p>
            <p>This forms the ultimate paradox of modernity: <span class="highlight">the more advanced technology becomes, the harder it is to ask "why use it?"</span> The more complete the function, the more absent the meaning. We possess "universal tools," yet lose the reason to use them. We are defined by function, yet forget why we live.</p>
            <p>Heidegger's ideal of "dwelling" appears especially precious: humans should not be driven by technology, but coexist with it, allowing technology to become a medium for "the unconcealment of Being." Yet today, we are driven by technology, losing the capacity to "dwell" in the flood of function.</p>

            <h2>IV. A Fourth Possibility: De-Alienated Function—The Return to Humanism</h2>
            <p>The triple alienation reveals the colonizing logic of functionality: from <span class="highlight">psychological dependence</span> (first) to <span class="highlight">spatial discipline</span> (second), to <span class="highlight">existential backlash</span> (third), functionality progressively ascends from tool to vessel of power, to enemy of meaning. Yet redemption does not lie in abandoning function, but in <span class="highlight">de-alienation</span>—toward a "humanistic return of function."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1. Participatory Design</strong>: Involve the disabled, elderly, children, and homeless in designing ramps, benches, and access gates, breaking the monopoly of "experts defining function." Berlin's variable-slope ramps and Barcelona's "anti-exclusion benches" are models of inclusive functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>2. Redundancy and Elasticity</strong>: Reject "optimal solution" thinking; allow space for "useless" corners. Amsterdam's "maze parks" and Tokyo's "slow lanes" preserve space for diverse bodies and serendipitous experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>3. Functional Subtraction</strong>: Actively uninstall non-essential functions; resist the temptation of "functional bloat." Separate work and personal accounts; reject "always-on" connectivity.</li>
                <li><strong>4. Anchoring in Meaning</strong>: Before using a function, ask: "Why use it?" Re-anchor function beneath life's purposes, not above them.</li>
                <li><strong>5. Technological Restraint</strong>: Advocate for "slow technology" and "low-function design," returning technology to its essence as tool, not existence itself.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Zhuangzi once said, "The usefulness of the useless is the greatest use." In the digital age, <span class="highlight">the 'useless' may be the last fortress against functional backlash</span>. It can be a book, a purposeless walk, a silent moment, or a view unphotographed. It produces no data, improves no efficiency, optimizes no performance—yet it allows us to reclaim our humanity: not as executors of function, but as subjects of meaning.</p>
            <p>Sartre emphasized in *Being and Nothingness*: humans are free, but freedom implies responsibility. True freedom is not the possession of infinite function, but the <span class="highlight">ability to refuse function</span>. When we can say "I don't need this reminder," "I need not enter this system," "I may not reply," only then do we truly restore subjectivity.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion: Beyond Function, There Is Life</h2>
            <p>The alienation of function is an inevitable product of modern instrumental rationality. Yet the meaning of civilization does not lie in the quantity of functions, but in whether it allows for the existence of <span class="highlight">diverse bodies, serendipitous experiences, and uncalculable encounters</span>. True freedom is not measured by how many functions we possess, but by our ability, amidst the ocean of function, to maintain reverence for the "useless use" and the courage to ask: "Why do I live?"</p>
            <p>In this era of functional overflow, may we still say: <strong>I use function, but function does not use me</strong>.<br>
            May functionality, in the end, return to its authenticity—not as ghost, colonizer, or antagonist, but as <span class="highlight">an extension and witness of what it means to be human</span>.</p>
            <div class="end-quote">
                When technology ceases to be merely a tool and becomes the echo through which we confirm our existence, we finally understand: true functionality is not efficiency, but the <span class="highlight">freedom to choose whether to need function at all</span>.
            </div>
            <p>Function, in the end, returns to humanity; and humanity, in the end, returns to life.</p>
