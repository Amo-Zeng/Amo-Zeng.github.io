            </ul>
            <h4>2. Advantages of Blockchain Technology</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> There is no centralized management institution in the blockchain network; all nodes jointly maintain the ledger, eliminating the risk of single-point failure and power concentration.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> All transaction records on the blockchain are publicly accessible, and any participant can verify the authenticity of the transaction, enhancing information transparency.</li>
                <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Blockchain uses cryptographic techniques to ensure data security and immutability. Once data is written into the blockchain, it cannot be tampered with or deleted, ensuring data reliability.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. The Application Potential of Blockchain Technology</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Financial Sector:</strong> Blockchain technology can simplify cross-border payments, reduce transaction costs, improve transaction efficiency, and enable decentralized finance (DeFi), providing users with fairer and more transparent financial services.</li>
                <li><strong>Supply Chain Management:</strong> Blockchain technology can achieve transparency and traceability of the supply chain, improve supply chain efficiency and security, and combat counterfeit products.</li>
                <li><strong>Identity Authentication:</strong> Blockchain technology can provide secure and trustworthy identity authentication solutions, protecting user privacy and combating identity theft and fraud.</li>
