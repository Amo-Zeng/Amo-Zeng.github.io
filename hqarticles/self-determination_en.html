            <h2>The Interplay of Digitalization, Ecological Self-Determination, and National Identity: A Multidimensional New Perspective on National Self-Determination</h2>
            <p>In the modern international political arena, national self-determination has always been a central issue, emphasizing that nations or ethnic groups have the right to determine their own political, economic, and cultural development paths. However, with the deepening of globalization, the rapid development of digital technologies, and the increasing prominence of environmental issues, ecological self-determination and national self-determination in the context of digitalization have gradually become essential components of the concept of self-determination. This article aims to explore the ways these new dimensions intersect, revealing their multi-layered impacts on national self-determination, and analyzing the opportunities and challenges they bring.</p>

            <h3>I. The Deep Meaning and Strategic Importance of Ecological Self-Determination</h3>
            <p>Ecological self-determination not only concerns how nations manage their natural resources but also involves how they maintain and express their national identity amidst a global environmental crisis. Specifically, ecological self-determination includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resource Sovereignty:</strong> Nations have the right to decide the use of their land, water resources, forests, and other natural resources, ensuring their sustainable use and equitable distribution. This sovereignty is not only an expression of economic interest but also a preservation of cultural and identity recognition.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Protection:</strong> While pursuing economic development, ecological self-determination requires nations to respect ecological balance, protect biodiversity, and maintain the integrity of ecosystems. This protection is not just an expression of environmental ethics but also a foundation for the transmission of national culture.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Heritage and Innovation:</strong> Ecosystems being the core of many national cultures, ecological self-determination not only preserves the transmission of traditional culture but also encourages cultural innovation based on ecological protection. By protecting and utilizing the ecological environment, nations can maintain tradition while exploring new forms of cultural expression.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. The Multifaceted Impact of the Digital Era on National Self-Determination</h3>
            <p>The digital revolution has brought new opportunities and challenges to national self-determination:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Information Dissemination and Cultural Identity:</strong> Through the internet and social media, ethnic groups can quickly and broadly disseminate their culture, history, and demands, enhancing national identity and cultural confidence. The spread of cultural content on digital platforms, such as music, dance, and language learning, not only preserves cultural heritage but also promotes cultural innovation and globalization.</li>
                <li><strong>Political Mobilization and Organization:</strong> Digital tools like social networks and encrypted messaging apps (like Telegram, Signal) provide new methods for organizing and mobilizing, making gatherings and protests beyond geographical limitations possible. This digital mobilization changes the way traditional political participation occurs, empowering national self-determination movements with new dynamics.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Autonomy and Innovation:</strong> The rise of the digital economy and blockchain technology offers new development paths for national economies, reducing dependency on traditional financial systems and enhancing economic autonomy. Through digital currencies or crowdfunding platforms, ethnic groups can independently raise funds to support their cultural and economic projects, decreasing reliance on external funding.</li>
            </ol>
