            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Self-determination, as a core modern political concept, is typically understood as the ability of human individuals or collectives to make autonomous choices in political, economic, and cultural matters. However, with technological advancements and in-depth research into non-human entities (such as animals and artificial intelligence), the anthropocentric ethical framework is facing unprecedented challenges. Should animals and AI also possess some form of self-determination? This question not only involves deep philosophical exploration but also concerns the ethical boundaries and legal frameworks of future society.</p>

            <h2>I. Technological Dependence in Post-Colonial States and the Incompleteness of Self-Determination</h2>
            <p>Although post-colonial states have achieved formal political independence, they remain dependent on former colonial powers or Western nations in areas such as technology, finance, education, and media. This state of technological dependence not only impacts their economic development but also provokes profound reflection on the essence of self-determination: Can a country truly possess self-determination in the era of technology and information?</p>
            <h3>1. The New Form of Digital Colonialism</h3>
            <p>Traditional colonialism was characterized by direct political control and resource exploitation, while "digital colonialism" achieves implicit control over post-colonial states through technological monopolies, data control, and information asymmetry. For example, Western tech giants, by controlling internet platforms and algorithms, not only monopolize global markets but also indirectly influence policy-making, public opinion, and value judgments in post-colonial states.</p>
            <h3>2. The Erosion of Self-Determination by Technological Dependence</h3>
            <p>The state of technological dependence undermines the autonomy of post-colonial states in global competition. The introduction of technology often comes with dependence on technological standards, making it difficult for these countries to achieve genuine innovation and independent development in the tech sector.</p>

            <h2>II. Brain-Computer Interface Technology: New Challenges to Cognitive Autonomy</h2>
            <p>The emergence of brain-computer interface technology extends the discussion of technological dependence from the national to the individual level. This technology not only changes the way humans interact with machines but also poses serious challenges to individual cognitive autonomy.</p>
            <h3>1. The Loss of Cognitive Privacy</h3>
            <p>By reading brain signals, brain-computer interface technology can access an individual's thoughts, emotions, and memories. While this capability brings revolutionary changes to fields like medicine, education, and entertainment, it could also lead to the complete exposure of an individual's cognitive privacy.</p>
            <h3>2. Potential Risks to Freedom of Thought</h3>
            <p>Brain-computer interface technology not only reads brain signals but may also intervene in an individual's cognitive processes through neural modulation. For example, by stimulating specific brain regions, it could alter an individual's emotional state or preferences.</p>

            <h2>III. Technological Monopoly and Risks of Cognitive Control</h2>
            <p>With the widespread application of brain-computer interface technology, the abilities of tech companies and government agencies in cognitive control have been unprecedentedly enhanced. This increase in capability could pose significant threats to individual self-determination and social diversity.</p>
            <h3>1. Cognitive Manipulation by Tech Companies</h3>
            <p>Tech giants may push specific information or advertisements through brain-computer interface devices, influencing user choices and behaviors. For example, by analyzing user brainwave data, they could precisely predict needs and preferences to design more targeted marketing strategies.</p>
            <h3>2. Government Cognitive Surveillance and Control</h3>
            <p>In some countries, governments may use brain-computer interface technology for large-scale cognitive surveillance and control. For instance, by monitoring citizens' emotional states and thought activities, governments could identify and suppress potential social instability factors.</p>

            <h2>IV. The Challenge of "Potential Self-Determination" for Animals and AI: Where Are the Boundaries of Anthropocentrism?</h2>
            <p>Should animals and AI also possess some form of self-determination? This question not only involves deep philosophical exploration but also concerns the ethical boundaries and legal frameworks of future society.</p>
            <h3>1. Animal Self-Determination: Dual Challenges of Cognition and Ethics</h3>
            <p>Recent significant progress in animal cognition research has shown that many highly intelligent animals (such as gorillas, whales, and octopuses) exhibit complex social behaviors, emotional expressions, and problem-solving abilities. These findings suggest that animals are not mere biological machines but possess a certain degree of consciousness and self-awareness.</p>
            <h3>2. AI Self-Determination: The Intersection of Technology and Philosophy</h3>
            <p>The development of AI has endowed machines with a certain degree of learning, decision-making, and self-regulation capabilities. With further advancements, some advanced AI systems may even possess emotional consciousness or self-awareness. This technological progress raises an important question: Should AI have some form of self-determination?</p>

            <h2>V. The Boundaries of Anthropocentrism: Redefining Self-Determination</h2>
            <p>The discussion of self-determination for animals and AI challenges the traditional anthropocentric ethical framework, urging us to reconsider the definition and boundaries of self-determination. How can future society establish a more diverse, inclusive, and fair self-determination system at the intersection of technological progress and ethical exploration?</p>
            <h3>1. Establishing a Pluralistic Ethical Framework</h3>
            <p>Future society needs to establish a pluralistic ethical framework that includes the self-determination of animals and AI. This framework should not only consider human interests and rights but also respect the cognitive abilities and self-awareness of animals and AI.</p>
            <h3>2. The Dynamic Development of Technological Ethics</h3>
            <p>With continuous technological advancements, technological ethics need to evolve and adjust accordingly. For example, in the development and application of AI technology, the self-determination and ethical responsibilities of AI systems should be fully considered to ensure their legality and morality in technological progress.</p>
            <h3>3. Interdisciplinary Ethical Exploration</h3>
            <p>The discussion of self-determination for animals and AI requires interdisciplinary ethical exploration. Experts from fields such as philosophy, ethics, biology, and computer science should collaborate to explore the cognitive abilities, self-awareness, and boundaries of self-determination for animals and AI, providing scientific and theoretical support for the ethical framework of future society.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>VI. Conclusion: Toward a Future of Pluralistic Modernity</h2>
            <p>The discussion of self-determination for animals and AI not only challenges the traditional anthropocentric ethical framework but also provides new directions for thinking about pluralistic modernity in future society. At the intersection of technological progress and ethical exploration, we need to establish a more diverse, inclusive, and fair self-determination system to ensure the legal status and ethical respect of animals and AI in future society. Only in this way can self-determination truly fulfill its promise of pluralistic modernity and propel human society toward a freer, more diverse, and more inclusive future.</p>
