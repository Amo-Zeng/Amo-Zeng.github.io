            <h2>National Self-Determination in the Digital Era: Safeguarding Cultural and Ecological Diversity Amid Technological Advances</h2>
            <p>In today's rapidly advancing world of digital and artificial intelligence technologies, national self-determination faces unprecedented challenges and opportunities. The global wave of digitalization has not only transformed information dissemination but also profoundly impacted the living environments and social structures of ethnic cultures. At the same time, global climate change and ethical issues in AI have become new challenges that national self-determination must address. How to preserve the uniqueness of ethnic cultures in the technological wave, how to achieve ecological symbiosis in the face of global climate change, and how to defend the ethical bottom line of national self-determination in the era of artificial intelligenceâ€”these are the core issues that contemporary society urgently needs to resolve.</p>

            <h3>I. National Self-Determination in the Digital Era: Challenges and Pathways for Cultural Survival</h3>
            <p>The advent of the digital era has both provided new platforms for the dissemination and development of ethnic cultures and brought about profound existential anxieties. Dominated by English-speaking Western cultures, backed by strong technological advantages and capital power, these cultures have occupied a dominant position on global digital platforms. This spread of cultural hegemony has squeezed the survival space of other ethnic cultures, accelerated the process of cultural homogenization, and threatened the uniqueness and identity of ethnic cultures.</p>

                <li><strong>1.2 Technological Divide and the Struggle for Discourse Power</strong></li>

            <h3>II. National Self-Determination and Ecological Symbiosis in the Face of Global Climate Change</h3>
            <p>Against the backdrop of increasingly severe global climate change, the balance between environmental protection and national development has become an urgent global challenge. Traditional "top-down" environmental protection models often overlook the ecological wisdom and cultural values of ethnic regions, while overemphasizing economic development may exacerbate environmental damage. In this dilemma, combining national self-determination with responses to global climate change to build a new relationship of ecological symbiosis may provide new ideas for the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature.</p>

            <h3>III. National Self-Determination in the Age of AI: Ethical Challenges and Symbiotic Pathways</h3>
            <p>The arrival of the AI era has brought complex ethical challenges to national self-determination. On one hand, the high development of artificial intelligence provides new momentum for social progress; on the other hand, it may exacerbate technological competition and cultural conflicts, threatening the realization of national self-determination.</p>

                <li><strong>3.1 Risks of Technological Competition and Marginalization</strong></li>
                <li><strong>3.2 Cultural Extinction and Identity Crisis</strong></li>
                <li><strong>3.3 The Urgency of AI Ethical Issues</strong></li>
                <li><strong>3.4 Symbiotic Pathways for National Self-Determination and Artificial Intelligence</strong></li>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In today's rapidly advancing world of digital and artificial intelligence technologies, national self-determination faces unprecedented challenges and opportunities. We need to safeguard cultural diversity in the digital era, achieve ecological symbiosis in the face of global climate change, and defend the ethical bottom line of national self-determination in the age of AI. By building digital-era cultural identities, promoting ecological symbiosis models, and exploring the ethical boundaries of artificial intelligence, we can find a development path that balances national autonomy and human coexistence in the technological wave. Only in this way can we achieve harmonious coexistence between humans and nature in addressing global challenges, leaving future generations a beautiful and livable Earth.</p>
