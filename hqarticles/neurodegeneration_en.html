            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's) has long focused primarily on intrinsic neuronal pathology. However, recent research has revealed a more complex systemic regulatory network. This article innovatively proposes a "gut-brain-vascular" triad model, integrating interactions between gut microbiota, epigenetics, and the neurovascular unit (NVU), systematically explaining how these three systems collectively drive neurodegeneration through metabolic, immune, and barrier functions. Based on this model, we explore cross-scale intervention strategies, including microbiota-epigenetic co-regulation and NVU-targeted repair, offering new approaches to overcome traditional treatment limitations.</p>

            <h2>Introduction: Paradigm Shift from Single-Target to Network Medicine</h2>
            <p>Traditional research on neurodegenerative diseases has largely focused on accumulation mechanisms of pathological proteins like β-amyloid and α-synuclein. However, repeated clinical failures of drugs targeting these markers suggest the diseases may stem from multi-system dysregulation. Recent breakthroughs in three major fields are reshaping our understanding:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Gut Microbiome</strong>: Directly modulates brain function through metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) and the vagus nerve;</li>
                <li><strong>Epigenetics</strong>: Reveals how environmental factors rewrite neuronal fate through DNA methylation and other mechanisms;</li>
                <li><strong>Neurovascular Unit</strong>: Dysfunction is confirmed as the hub of blood-brain barrier disruption and neuroinflammation.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This article is the first to propose these three systems form a "pathological triad," whose dynamic interactions collectively determine neurodegenerative progression (Figure 1).</p>

            <h2>I. Independent Roles and Synergistic Mechanisms of the Three Systems</h2>
            <h3>1. Gut Microbiome: The Remote "Metabolic Commander"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bidirectional Microbiota-Brain Communication</strong>: Reduced Prevotella in Parkinson's (PD) patients decreases brain neurotrophic factors (e.g., BDNF), while microbiota dysbiosis in Alzheimer's (AD) patients induces neuroinflammation via increased blood lipopolysaccharide (LPS).</li>
                <li><strong>Epigenetic Bridge Role</strong>: Microbiota metabolite butyrate inhibits histone deacetylases (HDACs), activating neuroprotective genes (e.g., SOD2).</li>
                <li><strong>Indirect Effects on NVU</strong>: Gut dysbiosis elevates circulating inflammatory factors (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α), disrupting blood-brain barrier tight junction proteins (e.g., claudin-5).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Epigenetics: The "Molecular Translator" of Environmental Stress</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spatiotemporal-Specific Regulation</strong>: Hypomethylation of the APP gene promoter in AD neurons correlates with excessive β-amyloid production, while abnormal histone acetylation in astrocytes drives neuroinflammation.</li>
                <li><strong>Interaction with NVU</strong>: Hypoxia-induced DNA methylation changes suppress vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, exacerbating cerebral hypoperfusion.</li>
                <li><strong>Microbiota-Epigenetic Cycle</strong>: High-fiber diets increase butyrate-producing bacteria, promoting histone acetylation and synaptic plasticity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Neurovascular Unit: The "Gatekeeper" of Microenvironment Homeostasis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multi-Cellular Dysregulation</strong>: Pericyte degeneration impairs capillary contractility, while M1-polarized microglia release reactive oxygen species (ROS) directly damaging neuronal mitochondria.</li>
                <li><strong>Epigenetic Regulation Evidence</strong>: Aberrant overexpression of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3A) in NVU silences LRP1, hindering β-amyloid clearance.</li>
                <li><strong>Target of Gut-Derived Attacks</strong>: Gut-derived TMAO (trimethylamine N-oxide) activates NLRP3 inflammasome, accelerating blood-brain barrier leakage.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>II. New Therapeutic Strategies: From Isolated to Synergistic Interventions</h2>
            <h3>1. Microbiota-Epigenetic Combination Therapy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Precision Probiotics</strong>: Engineered lactobacilli deliver HDAC inhibitors (e.g., sodium butyrate) to the gut for targeted epigenetic modulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Diet-Gene Interaction Intervention</strong>: Combining Mediterranean diet (rich in polyphenols) with DNA methylation inhibitors (e.g., 5-azacytidine) enhances neuroprotective gene expression.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Cross-System NVU Repair Strategies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vascular-Glial Reprogramming</strong>: CRISPR-dCas9 technology modifies methylation status of PDGFRβ in pericytes to restore contractile function.</li>
                <li><strong>Vagus Nerve Stimulation</strong>: Activates cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway to simultaneously suppress gut inflammation and microglial activation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. AI-Driven Personalized Medicine</h3>
            <p>Integrating patient microbiota sequencing, epigenomic, and cerebrovascular imaging data to build predictive models for optimizing combination therapies (e.g., fecal microbiota transplantation with HDAC inhibitor selection).</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Challenges and Future Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Causality Determination</strong>: Requires humanized microbiota animal models and organoid co-culture systems to clarify temporal interactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Intervention Window</strong>: The irreversible nature of neurodegeneration demands early biomarkers (e.g., gut dysbiosis index combined with NVU permeability assessment).</li>
                <li><strong>Ethics and Safety</strong>: Off-target risks of epigenetic editing and long-term effects of microbiota transplantation require rigorous evaluation.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Neurodegenerative diseases represent systemic disorders of dynamic imbalance in the "gut-brain-vascular" network. Overcoming current treatment limitations requires a "holistic medicine" perspective to develop intelligent therapies targeting multiple systems. Future research should focus on decoding the communication codes among these three systems, advancing precision prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases into the 2.0 era.</p>
