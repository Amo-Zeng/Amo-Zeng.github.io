            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The lithosphere, the rigid outer layer of Earth, not only forms the foundation beneath our feet but also plays a crucial role in ecosystems, life activities, and climate change. This article explores how the lithosphere influences and supports the biosphere on the surface, underground microbial life, and engages in long-term interactions with climate change, revealing the profound effects these interactions have on the Earth's system.</p>

            <h3>Lithosphere and Ecosystem Services</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soil Formation</strong>: Different types of rocks through weathering processes form various soil textures, affecting vegetation types and distributions. For example, granite weathering forms sandy soils suitable for certain plants that thrive in nutrient-poor conditions, while limestone forms calcium carbonate-rich soils, influencing plant growth and microbial activity.</li>
                <li><strong>Mineral Supply</strong>: The lithosphere releases minerals like calcium, phosphorus, iron, and potassium which directly affect plant growth and nutrient uptake, thereby influencing the health and diversity of the entire ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Cycle</strong>: The lithosphere plays a significant role in groundwater storage, water purification, and the interaction between surface and groundwater. For instance, karst landscapes in limestone regions provide unique hydrogeological features, supporting underground ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Microbial Life in the Lithosphere</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adaptation to Extreme Environments</strong>: Microbes like archaea and hyperthermophiles survive in high-temperature, high-pressure, and low-oxygen conditions through special biochemical mechanisms, showcasing the limits of life's adaptability.</li>
                <li><strong>Biogeochemical Cycles</strong>: These microbes participate in Earth's carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen cycles, affecting the planet's surface chemistry and climate, providing valuable clues for the study of life's origin and extraterrestrial life exploration.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Long-term Interaction of the Lithosphere with Climate Change</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Carbon Cycle</strong>: The weathering, sedimentation, and burial of rocks absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, regulating climate. Conversely, volcanic activity might increase atmospheric CO₂, leading to greenhouse effects.</li>
                <li><strong>Volcanic Activity</strong>: Volcanic eruptions release sulfides and volcanic ash that can temporarily alter Earth's temperature and atmospheric composition, influencing climate patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Geological Processes</strong>: Crustal uplift, erosion, and ocean-continent interactions all participate in the absorption and release of CO₂, affecting the long-term evolution of Earth's climate.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The lithosphere is not just Earth's hard shell; it is the intersection of ecosystems, life activities, and climate change. Through soil formation, mineral supply, and water cycling, the lithosphere supports diverse surface ecosystems; through its deep microbial life, it showcases life's limits and diversity; through geological processes and volcanic activity, it participates in and influences the long-term evolution of climate change.</p>
            <p>Understanding these interactions is crucial for ecosystem conservation, agricultural production, environmental management, life sciences research, and developing strategies to address climate change. By delving into the functions of the lithosphere, we can not only better protect and utilize Earth's natural resources but also provide scientific evidence for future climate change prediction and management, promoting sustainable development between humans and Earth.</p>
