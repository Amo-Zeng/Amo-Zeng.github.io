            <h2>Prelude: The Silent Cosmos</h2>
            <p>The pulsars floating in star charts resemble silent footnotes. When humanity discovered the carbon-based photosynthetic imprints on planet TRAPPIST-1e, what emerged wasn't the anticipated extraterrestrial symphony, but profound anxiety about organic silence. As the archaea chronometer at the black hole's event horizon chimed its final vibration, humanity finally realized interstellar travel is essentially sensory autophagy using ourselves as coordinate systems.</p>

            <h2>Act I: Captives of Information (Stellar Prison at Planck Scale)</h2>
            <p>In the pre-dawn Artemis Base, engineers' fingers tracing quantum communication arrays leave ice crystal patterns in the vacuum. Entanglement data from hydrogen atoms relayed by the Mozi satellite reveals the universe's most frigid equation: each quantum gene chain acquires entropy correction factors through de Sitter space...</p>
            <p>The primordial intelligence magnified by gravitational lenses leaves the first anti-entropy matrix on Kepler-452b: low-entropy coral reefs persisting 197,000 years can reconstruct information matrices during stellar collapse...</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Act II: Ethical Dimensions (Parchment in Klein Bottle)</h2>
            <p>Dark energy microorganisms captured by the Second Fleet in the Pillars of Creation caused humanity's first species-level verbal paralysis at the Galactic Tribunal. These gelatinous lifeforms coexisting in quintuple phase states expose modal fissures undefined in classical ethics...</p>
            <p>Superfluid helium experiments on China's space station reveal a fatal truth: the quantum state collapse of interstellar ethics inevitably accompanies consciousness melting points...</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Act III: Fractures of Consciousness (Afterimage in Time's Fold)</h2>
            <p>The ancient mycelium network in Martian lava tubes suddenly emits Von Neumann radiation, holographically replaying Earth's five mass extinctions. Starship pilots trembling near the Bekenstein boundary discover their minds storing memorial projections from forty-two dying stellar civilizations...</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Epilogue: Awakening Algorithm (Sign Language of Self-Observers)</h2>
            <p>Terminal code from captured drifting civilizations reveals: What truly defines life isn't negentropy acquisition, but ontological humor in dimensional compromise...</p>
            <p>As vacuum zero-point energy ripples through the Orion Arm, the last star cartographer finally understands: Life was never an entropy-reduction machine, but pupils gazing at destiny beyond light cones...</p>
