            <h2>The Rise of Technology and the Challenge of Humanization</h2>
            <p>Technology, like an untiring craftsman, is carving our world at an astonishing speed. From the intricate calculations of artificial intelligence to the gene editing of biotechnology, the reach of technology has extended into every corner of human life. However, in this digital age, have we ever paused to consider the relationship between technology and humanity? In the rapid development of technology, has humanity been forgotten in some corner?</p>

            <h3>The Double-Edged Sword of Digitalization</h3>
            <p>Digitalization is undoubtedly a double-edged sword in modern society. It brings unprecedented convenience and efficiency, allowing information to flow at our fingertips and communication to transcend time and space. However, digitalization also gradually datafies and algorithmizes our lives. Every move we make is recorded, analyzed, and even predicted. In this process, our privacy becomes precarious, and our autonomy is eroded imperceptibly.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Digital platforms may collect data without explicit user notification.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy Risks:</strong> Collected data may be used for purposes beyond the original intent, or even abused by third parties.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Virtualization:</strong> The digital world seems to gradually strip us of our humanity, making our social interactions virtual.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technology and Humanity: Finding the Balance</h3>
            <p>However, technology is not destined to coexist harmoniously with humanity. In the torrent of technology, we can still see the glow of humanity. For example, in the medical field, technological advancements not only improve medical standards but also ensure timely treatment for more patients. In education, technology breaks geographical barriers, enabling the sharing of high-quality educational resources. In these fields, technology is not a cold tool but carries human care and hope.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Medical Technology:</strong> Technological progress enhances medical standards, ensuring treatment for more patients.</li>
                <li><strong>Educational Resources:</strong> Technology breaks geographical barriers, enabling the sharing of high-quality educational resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Human-Centered Design:</strong> The design and application of technology need to consider human needs and feelings more.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h3>The Future of Humanized Technology</h3>
            <p>Looking ahead, the development of technology will surely accelerate. In this process, we need to make technology more humanized. This means that the design and application of technology need to consider human needs and feelings more. Technological advances should aim to improve the quality of human life rather than at the expense of humanity.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Dance of Technology and Humanity</h3>
            <p>The relationship between technology and humanity is like a complex dance. In this dance, we need to grasp the rhythm and find the balance. We need to make technology an extension of humanity, not an opposite. Only then can technology truly serve humanity and become a force for social progress. In this era of digitalization and humanization, let us join hands and dance to a harmonious future where technology and humanity coexist.</p>

            <h3>Appendix: Three Perspectives of Psychological Anthropology</h3>
            <p>To comprehensively understand the interplay of technology and humanity, we can explore it from three perspectives of psychological anthropology:</p>
