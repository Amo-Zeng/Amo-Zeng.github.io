            <h3>Hybrid Optimization of Quantum Neural Networks and Classical Neural Networks</h3>
            <p>The hybrid optimization of Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) and Classical Neural Networks (CNN) is a current research hotspot. Quantum computing has significant advantages in handling large-scale data and complex computational tasks, while classical neural networks excel in feature extraction and pattern recognition. By combining QNN and CNN, the strengths of both can be fully utilized to enhance the overall system performance.</p>
            <p>The key to hybrid optimization lies in effectively integrating quantum computing with classical computing. A common method is to use quantum computing for feature extraction and then input the extracted features into classical neural networks for classification or regression tasks. This method not only improves computational efficiency but also reduces computational complexity. Additionally, the parallel processing capability of quantum computing can significantly accelerate the training process, allowing the model to converge in a shorter time.</p>

            <h3>Application of Quantum Neural Networks in Privacy Computing</h3>
            <p>Privacy computing is an important research direction in the current field of information security. Traditional neural networks have the risk of privacy leakage when handling sensitive data. The application of quantum neural networks in privacy computing provides new solutions to this problem. Quantum computing's Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) technology can ensure data transmission security, and the quantum state encoding method can protect data privacy.</p>
            <p>The application of quantum neural networks in privacy computing is mainly reflected in the following aspects: First, quantum computing can ensure data security during transmission and storage through quantum state encoding and Quantum Key Distribution technology. Second, quantum neural networks can be trained and inferred without leaking the original data, thereby protecting user privacy. Lastly, the parallel processing capability of quantum computing can significantly improve the efficiency of privacy computing, making privacy protection no longer a bottleneck for system performance.</p>

            <h3>Comparative Study of Quantum Neural Networks and Biological Neural Networks</h3>
            <p>Biological Neural Networks (BNN) are the most efficient computational systems in nature, possessing high adaptability and learning capabilities. Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), as an artificial intelligence technology, have similarities with biological neural networks in some aspects but also have significant differences.</p>
            <p>Firstly, quantum neural networks and biological neural networks have similarities in structure. Both are composed of a large number of nodes (neurons) and connections (synapses), achieving learning and decision-making through information transmission and processing. However, the nodes and connections of quantum neural networks are based on quantum bits (qubits), possessing unique properties such as superposition and entanglement, which give them far superior computational capabilities compared to classical neural networks.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there are significant differences in the learning mechanisms of quantum neural networks and biological neural networks. The learning of biological neural networks is achieved through the adjustment of synaptic strength, while the learning of quantum neural networks is achieved through the evolution and optimization of quantum states. The learning speed and efficiency of quantum neural networks are far superior to those of biological neural networks, but their stability and adaptability still need further research.</p>
            <p>Lastly, quantum neural networks and biological neural networks have different focuses in application scenarios. Biological neural networks are mainly applied in perception, cognition, and decision-making, while quantum neural networks are more suitable for handling large-scale data and complex computational tasks. Through the comparative study of the two, new insights can be provided for the design and optimization of quantum neural networks.</p>
