            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In today's increasingly globalized world, the concept of "mutual benefit and win-win" has become an important guiding principle for promoting sustainable development in society, economy, and the environment. This concept emphasizes maximizing collective benefits through the sharing of resources and complementary advantages among cooperative parties, rather than a zero-sum game where one party wins while the other loses. Not only does this idea play a significant role in business collaborations, but it also profoundly influences the development of international relations and demonstrates robust vitality in the field of social welfare. This article will explore the paths to achieving mutual benefit and win-win from the perspectives of business collaboration, international relations, and social welfare, and its profound implications for building a sustainable society.</p>
