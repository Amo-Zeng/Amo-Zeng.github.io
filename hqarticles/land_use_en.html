**"Advanced Mathematics"** (Êï∏Â≠∏Áî≤) is typically a **high-level mathematics subject** in Taiwan's "General Scholastic Ability Test" (Â≠∏Ê∏¨) or "Subject Proficiency Test" (ÂàÜÁßëÊ∏¨È©ó, formerly the Designated Subjects Exam), primarily targeting students aiming for science and engineering programs. Below is important information about Advanced Mathematics:

---

### **1. Exam Positioning and Content**
- **Target Audience**: Students aiming for majors such as mathematics, physics, engineering, computer science, and other fields requiring a solid mathematical foundation.
- **Exam Scope**:
  - **Calculus** (limits, differentiation, integration, applications)
  - **Linear Algebra** (matrices, vectors, plane and spatial vectors)
  - **Probability and Statistics** (advanced probability models, statistical inference)
  - **Functions and Polynomials** (rational functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, trigonometric functions)
  ‚ö†Ô∏è The difficulty level is significantly higher than "Mathematics B" (ÂïÜÁÆ°Á§æÊúÉÁµÑÊï∏Â≠∏), emphasizing logical reasoning and abstract computational skills.

### **2. Exam Focus and Trends**
- **Popular Question Types**:
  - Calculus application problems (finding extrema, area/volume)
  - Spatial geometry and vector analysis
  - Probability distributions (binomial/normal distribution)
  - Matrix transformations (linear transformations, solving systems of equations)
- **Practical Skills**: Proficiency in **calculator tools** (e.g., engineering calculators for solving matrices/integrals) is required. Recent exams increasingly incorporate situational problems (e.g., AI models, physical motion analysis).

### **3. Preparation Strategies**
- **Recommended Materials**:
  - Textbooks: Longteng and Hanlin editions of Advanced Mathematics
  - Reference Books: „ÄäDialogue-style Advanced Mathematics„Äã, „ÄäWeekly Advanced Mathematics Mock Tests„Äã
- **Key Practices**:
  1. Master **past exams** (last 10 years' Subject Proficiency Test questions)
  2. Compile a **formula handbook**: Focus on calculus techniques and statistical formulas
  3. Strengthen **time management**: 25 questions/80 minutes, averaging only 3 minutes per question!

> üí° **Tip**: Advanced Mathematics scores are a **critical threshold** for top-tier science and engineering programs. Aiming for the top score (approximately 12+ grade points) requires mastering ‚â•85% of the content.

### **4. Score Conversion and Weighting**
- **Grade Point System**: Full score of 60 points ‚Üí Converted to 15 grade points
- **Examples of Major Requirements**:
  - NTU Electrical Engineering: Advanced Mathematics √ó1.5 (weighted)
  - NTHU Computer Science: Advanced Mathematics + Physics at the standard level
  - NCKU Mechanical Engineering: Overall grade points prioritized, Advanced Mathematics score below standard disqualifies applicants
