            <h2>The Green Code of Life: The Mysteries of Plant Social Behavior, Evolution, and Intelligence</h2>
            <p>Walking through a lush forest, the vibrant green life is intoxicating. However, have we ever considered that these seemingly quiet beings are actually engaging in fascinating "social interactions," evolutionary journeys spanning time, and exhibiting surprising "emotions" and "memories"? As one of the oldest forms of life on Earth, plants are not only witnesses to time but also indispensable pillars of the ecosystem. Through complex social networks, sophisticated evolutionary strategies, and unique intelligence mechanisms, they have built a green world filled with wisdom and strategy.</p>

            <h3>Social Networks: The Silent Conversations of Plants</h3>
            <p>Plants do not exist in isolation; they have a complex social network that allows them to communicate, cooperate, and even compete with surrounding plants, microorganisms, and the environment. This social interaction does not rely on vision or hearing but is achieved through root systems, chemical signals, and microbial partners, forming a hidden and intricate communication system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Root Networks: Silent Communication</strong>
                    <p>Plant roots are not just tools for absorbing water and nutrients; they are also important channels for "social interaction." Fungal hyphae form a vast network, connecting the roots of adjacent plants, creating a phenomenon known as the "mycorrhizal network." Through this network, plants can share nutrients, transmit signals, and even exchange genes. For example, when a plant is attacked by pests, it releases specific chemical substances that are transmitted through the mycorrhizal network to neighboring plants, warning them to strengthen their defenses.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Chemical Signals: Silent Alarms</strong>
                    <p>Plants also communicate through the release of chemical signals. When a plant senses a threat from pests, it releases "volatile organic compounds" that can directly repel pests and attract their natural enemies. More interestingly, plants can also release specific volatiles to warn their neighbors. For example, when a tobacco plant is attacked by caterpillars, it releases "methyl jasmonate," which prompts surrounding tobacco plants to produce more defense proteins and enhance their resistance to pests.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Microbial Partners: Mutualism</strong>
                    <p>The relationship between plants and microorganisms is far more complex than we imagine. It is not a simple parasitic or symbiotic relationship but a mutually beneficial partnership. For example, in the relationship between leguminous plants and rhizobia, rhizobia convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia that plants can absorb, while leguminous plants provide carbohydrates to the rhizobia. This mutualistic relationship not only allows leguminous plants to thrive in poor soil but also significantly contributes to soil fertility.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cooperation and Competition: The Essence of Social Interaction</strong>
                    <p>Plant social networks are not always harmonious. In resource-limited environments, plants also compete. For example, some plants release chemicals to inhibit the growth of surrounding plants, competing for more sunlight, water, and nutrients. However, even in competitive relationships, plants exhibit remarkable intelligence. For example, tall trees shade lower plants to suppress their growth, while shrubs and herbaceous plants grow and reproduce rapidly to obtain sufficient energy.</p>

            <h3>The Evolutionary Code: Plants' Time Travel</h3>
            <p>The evolutionary history of plants is a grand epic. From the earliest cyanobacteria in the primordial oceans to the emergence of the first land plants, and then the successive evolution of ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms, plants have continuously broken their own limitations and conquered broader living spaces. They have generated oxygen in the oceans, woven green on the land, and built the network of life on Earth.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adaptation and Evolution: The Wisdom of Evolution</strong>
                    <p>The adaptability of plants is astounding. Lichens, ancient organisms composed of algae and fungi, are among the most resilient life forms on Earth. They can survive in extreme environments, using the acidic substances they secrete to slowly break down rocks, promoting weathering and paving the way for the emergence of subsequent life. Some desert plants enter a "dormant" state during dry seasons, minimizing their life activities, and waiting for the rainy season. This precise control of time and the tenacious wait for life demonstrate the advanced survival strategies formed by plants during evolution.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Evolutionary Journey: A Microcosm of Earth's History</strong>
                    <p>The evolutionary journey of plants is a microcosm of Earth's history. From the fern forests of the dinosaur era to the coniferous forests after the Quaternary ice age, and to the modern rainforest ecosystems, plants have always been active participants and witnesses of Earth's history. They record the past of the Earth through their growth, reproduction, and evolution, and also predict the future of the Earth.</p>

            <h3>Emotions and Memory: The Mysteries of Plant Intelligence</h3>
            <p>When we talk about the "emotions" and "memory" of plants, it might seem absurd. After all, emotions and memory are often considered exclusive to higher animals like humans. However, scientific research shows that although plants do not have a nervous system or brain, they exhibit surprising "emotional responses" and "memory capabilities."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensing and Responding: The Emotional Experience of Plants</strong>
                    <p>The "emotions" of plants are not the joys and sorrows we imagine, but a keen perception of the environment and precise responses. The rapid response of a Venus flytrap when capturing insects, the closing of leaves in a sensitive plant when touched, and the turning of sunflowers to follow the sun's trajectory all demonstrate plants' perception and adaptation to external stimuli. Plants can sense the wavelength and intensity of light, subtle changes in temperature, and even distinguish the concentration of different chemical substances.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Memory Traces: The Accumulation of Experience</strong>
                    <p>The "memory" of plants is far beyond our imagination. They can remember environmental stresses they have experienced and make corresponding adjustments in the future. For example, plants that have experienced drought will place more emphasis on water storage and reduce transpiration; plants that have been attacked by pests will release specific chemical substances to attract natural enemies for protection. More interestingly, plants can pass on "memories" to their offspring through genetic material, forming stronger resilience and adapting to new environments.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Beyond the Surface: The Inspiration of Plant Intelligence</strong>
                    <p>The "emotions" and "memory" of plants are actually advanced life strategies formed during their long evolutionary process. They perceive environmental changes, make precise responses, and store lessons learned, thus surviving and reproducing in the competitive natural world. This "intelligence," although different from the neural network system of humans, demonstrates remarkable adapt
