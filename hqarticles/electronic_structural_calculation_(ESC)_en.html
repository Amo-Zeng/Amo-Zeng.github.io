            <h2>Paradigm Shift in Electronic Structure Calculations: From Static to Dynamic and the Integration of Models</h2>
            <p>Electronic structure calculations, a core tool in modern materials science, chemistry, and physics, provide a theoretical foundation for understanding material properties, designing new functional materials, and optimizing chemical reaction processes. They also play a crucial role in exploring novel quantum phenomena. However, as the complexity of research objects increases and application scenarios diversify, the limitations of traditional "static" and "data-driven" electronic structure calculation methods are becoming more apparent. Especially when dealing with non-equilibrium problems, topological materials, and large-scale complex systems, the accuracy and efficiency of traditional methods are difficult to meet the needs of modern scientific research. Therefore, electronic structure calculations are undergoing a profound paradigm shift: from static to dynamic, from data-driven to model-driven, and gradually evolving towards multi-level and multi-scale integration. This article will explore this paradigm shift and its profound impact from three key dimensions: the rise of "model-driven" methods, breakthrough computational methods for topological materials, and the application of dynamic electronic structure calculations.</p>

            <h3>Limitations of Traditional Methods</h3>
            <p>Traditional electronic structure calculation methods, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD), have achieved great success in simulations of equilibrium states and simple systems, but their limitations are increasingly apparent when dealing with complex systems and non-equilibrium problems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accuracy dependent on empirical parameters</strong>: The choice of exchange-correlation functionals in DFT significantly impacts the calculation results, and there is currently no single functional that performs optimally in all cases.</li>
                <li><strong>Difficulty in handling complex systems</strong>: Traditional methods often require extensive computational resources and struggle to ensure accuracy in large-scale systems and non-equilibrium problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenges with topological materials and strong correlation effects</strong>: The traditional Schrödinger equation cannot directly compute topological invariants, making it difficult to handle strong correlation effects and complex many-body quantum states.</li>
                <li><strong>Difficulty in simulating non-equilibrium processes</strong>: Static methods fail to capture the dynamic evolution of systems over time, making it challenging to deal with multi-scale coupling and multi-physics interactions.</li>
