            <h2>Multidimensional Health Threats of Climate Change: From Infectious Diseases to Mental Anxiety</h2>
            <p>Climate change is not only a core issue in global environmental governance but also a critical challenge that profoundly affects human health. By altering ecosystems, transmission patterns, and human behavior, it has a far-reaching multidimensional impact on infectious diseases, chronic illnesses, and mental health. This article will delve into these three perspectives to explore the threats posed by climate change to human health and propose comprehensive strategies to address this complex issue.</p>

            <h3>Climate Change and the Spread of Infectious Diseases: The Remodeling of Ecosystems and Health Crises</h3>
            <p>The primary impact of climate change on the spread of infectious diseases lies in its alteration of the survival environments and transmission patterns of vector organisms. With global temperature increases, the reproduction rates and lifespans of vectors such as mosquitoes and ticks accelerate, significantly increasing the risk of disease transmission. For example, higher temperatures speed up mosquito reproduction and lifespan, thus expanding the range and intensity of malaria transmission. Changes in precipitation patterns also contribute to mosquito breeding, as increased wetlands and puddles provide ideal breeding grounds.</p>
            <p>More seriously, climate change has extended the transmission range of infectious diseases from tropical and subtropical regions to temperate regions. Diseases such as dengue fever and Zika virus, which were once confined to the tropics, are now gradually spreading northward, even reaching regions such as Northern Europe, traditionally less affected. This geographical expansion not only increases the threat of new infectious diseases but also poses new challenges to global healthcare systems. For instance, countries in Northern Europe have recently had to confront a surge in mosquito-borne diseases, placing unprecedented pressure on public health systems.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, climate change exacerbates the spread of infectious diseases by altering ecosystems and human behavior. Population migrations caused by rising sea levels and extreme weather events increase interactions between different regions, accelerating the spread of pathogens. Traditional disease surveillance and control systems are ill-equipped to handle this complex situation, necessitating global monitoring and information sharing to build more resilient response mechanisms.</p>

            <h3>Climate Change and Chronic Diseases: The Accumulation of Physiological Stress and Public Health Crises</h3>
            <p>The impact of climate change on chronic diseases is mainly manifested through its long-term physiological stress on humans. Extreme heatwaves have particularly significant effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Heat increases cardiac load, leading to elevated heart rates and blood pressure, thereby increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. Additionally, heat can cause dehydration, further exacerbating the pressure on cardiovascular systems. For the elderly and the vulnerable, this effect can be particularly severe, even life-threatening.</p>
            <p>Air pollution is another major factor closely related to climate change and chronic diseases. Rising global temperatures exacerbate forest fires and industrial emissions, leading to higher concentrations of particulate matter and harmful gases in the air. Prolonged exposure to polluted environments worsens chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and increases the incidence of lung cancer. For example, the frequent forest fires in Europe and North America in recent years have caused a sharp drop in air quality, posing a serious threat to the respiratory health of local residents.</p>
            <p>Moreover, climate change indirectly affects the development of chronic diseases by altering dietary patterns and lifestyles. Extreme weather events such as floods and droughts can lead to reduced food production, disrupting global food supply chains and exacerbating risks of malnutrition and metabolic diseases. Recent frequent droughts in Africa and South Asia have resulted in reduced food production, worsening local malnutrition issues.</p>
            <p>From a public health perspective, addressing the impact of climate change on chronic diseases requires multi-layered intervention measures. Governments and public health institutions should strengthen environmental monitoring and early warning systems, promptly issuing alerts for heatwaves and air pollution to guide public protection measures. Healthcare systems need to enhance the management of chronic disease patients, providing personalized health advice. For example, using smart wearable devices to monitor patients' physiological indicators in real-time and adjusting medication doses and lifestyle recommendations based on weather changes.</p>

            <h3>Climate Change and Mental Health: Climate Anxiety and Psychological Crises</h3>
            <p>The impact of climate change on human mental health has gradually become a focal point in psychological and sociological research. Extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and heatwaves not only damage the physical environment but also have profound effects on people's mental health. Studies show that individuals experiencing extreme weather events, especially those who lose their homes or loved ones, are more likely to develop mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. For example, after Hurricane Harvey struck Texas in 2017, the mental health issues of local residents significantly increased, with many people experiencing long-term depression and anxiety.</p>
