            <h2>Marriage: A Triad Game of Emotion, Technology, and Power</h2>
            <p>Marriage, as a social institution that has persisted for thousands of years, is undergoing unprecedented transformation. In this digital age, marriage is no longer merely the union of two souls, but a complex game involving emotion, technology, and power. The intersection and collision of these three dimensions not only redefine the essence of modern marriage but also bring forth unprecedented opportunities and challenges.</p>

            <h3>Emotional Account: A Silent Investment</h3>
            <p>Each person enters marriage with their own emotional account filled with memories from their family of origin, love and trauma from their growth, and fantasies and fears about intimacy. In a sense, marriage is a silent emotional investment, where deposits and withdrawals form the basic rhythm of married life.</p>
            <p>Deposits are the warmest interactions in marriage. A kiss in the morning, a hug when tired, remembering each other's preferences—these seemingly trivial actions are the most precious currency in the emotional account. However, withdrawals are inevitable. Harsh words during arguments, cold attitudes under work pressure, differences in parenting philosophies—all quietly deplete the balance of the emotional account. If withdrawals occur too frequently, the account will gradually be overdrawn, and the marriage will face hollow arguments and alienation.</p>
            <p>The most dangerous thing is not a single withdrawal but a vicious cycle of the emotional account. When the balance is insufficient, both parties' vigilance and defensiveness intensify, leading to more withdrawals and creating a self-reinforcing vicious cycle. Maintaining the balance of the emotional account requires wisdom: accumulating sufficient deposits while promptly repairing the damage caused by withdrawals. Those marriages that last often depend on daily emotional accumulation and swift repair during crises. The economics of marriage teach us that happiness is not a gift of fate but an investment that requires careful management.</p>

            <h3>Social Media: The Double-Edged Sword of Modern Marriage</h3>
            <p>The rise of social media has changed every aspect of our lives, including marriage. It is a double-edged sword, bringing couples closer while also posing numerous challenges. For couples living apart, social media becomes a crucial bond, allowing them to share moments of life instantly and feel each other's presence. However, the negative impacts of social media are equally significant.</p>
            <p>Social media creates an idealized illusion of marriage, making many people harbor unrealistic expectations of their partners. The meticulously curated perfect presentations often show only the most glamorous side of life. This idealized portrayal can lead to jealousy, comparison, and dissatisfaction, ultimately undermining marital harmony. More importantly, social media is changing the patterns of intimate relationships between couples. Being immersed in the virtual world, we may neglect face-to-face communication, reducing physical touch and emotional expression. Prolonged social media use can lead to a lack of emotional exchange, weakening the establishment of intimacy. Additionally, excessive sharing can raise privacy concerns for partners, leading to trust crises.</p>
            <p>Facing the challenges posed by social media, couples need to establish healthy usage habits, avoiding excessive reliance on the virtual world at the expense of real emotional communication. Cultivating shared interests, creating opportunities for face-to-face interaction, and enhancing mutual understanding and trust are crucial. Most importantly, couples should constantly remind themselves that the perfect presentations on social media do not equate to real life, and genuine emotional connections are key to a lasting marriage.</p>

            <h3>Power Games: The Invisible War in Marriage</h3>
            <p>In the seemingly calm realm of marriage, power games never cease. Traditional gender role divisions have confined men and women within fixed social expectations, creating an unequal power structure. In the past, husbands often held the economic reins of the family, possessing absolute decision-making power, while wives were expected to play a submissive role, primarily responsible for childcare and housework.</p>
            <p>However, with social development and the emergence of women’s consciousness, the power balance in marriage began to shift. Women no longer content with single-dimensional family roles aspire to achieve self-worth in the workplace and wish to have equal say in family decisions. This shift disrupted the traditional power equilibrium, making role transitions between spouses inevitable. The transformation from "men working outside, women inside" to "dual-income families" reflects not only economic changes but also the start of power restructuring in marital relationships.</p>
            <p>In today's society, power games in marriage are no longer simple zero-sum games. The traditional patterns of dominance and submission are being replaced by new forms of partnership. Couples build equal power structures through negotiation and communication. Women gain more voice through economic independence, while men may take on more household and childcare responsibilities. This role swap does not signify the loss of power but rather the dissolution of traditional stereotypes.</p>
            <p>The essence of power games is undergoing profound changes. Couples increasingly recognize that power is not a tool to control each other but a bond that maintains the relationship. When power becomes a bridge to understanding rather than a weapon of suppression, marriage can truly mature and harmonize.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Multidimensional Challenges of Marriage</h3>
            <p>Marriage is both an emotional investment, a double-edged sword of technology, and the battlefield of power games. The balance of the emotional account, the pros and cons of social media, and the evolution of power structures intertwine to form the complex landscape of modern marriage. In this era of digitalization and diversification, marriage is no longer a simple contract, but a triad game involving emotion, technology, and power.</p>
            <p>To face this game, we need wisdom and courage. Wisdom lies in managing the emotional account, avoiding the negative impacts of social media, and understanding the essence of power games. Courage is needed to embrace changes and accept the uncertainties and challenges in marriage. Only by doing so can we find the balance point in the interplay of emotion, technology, and power, safeguard the authenticity of marriage, and create a happy and fulfilling family life. The future of marriage depends on how we find our own answers in this triad game.</p>
