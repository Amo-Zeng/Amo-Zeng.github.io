            <h3>One: The Fundamental Transformation — Rise of Health Discourse</h3>
            <p>The "Health Discourse Database" developed by Columbia University reveals: Effective health communication is essentially a re-encoding of cultural symbols. Its "Diabetes Myth Deconstruction Project" in Latin America modified local folktales, increasing the effectiveness of diabetes education by four times. This "Culture-Adaptive Communication" is giving birth to a new interdisciplinary field — health anthropology, whose central question is: how to translate scientific evidence into cultural instinct.</p>

            <h3>Two: Next-Generation School of Public Health: Constructive Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Quantized Governance:</strong> Build systems that simultaneously exhibit policy certainty (particulate nature) and cultural adaptability (wave-like nature).</li>
                <li><strong>Resilient Education System:</strong> Cultivate "T-shaped" talents who can handle "unknown unknowns" — with knowledge spanning virology, climate science, social psychology, and more.</li>
                <li><strong>Development of Ethical Technologies:</strong> Create intelligent systems aligned with "health ethics algorithms" to ensure technological evolution aligns with human health as the ultimate value.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Three: The Topological Structure of Future Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Topology Dilemma:</strong> Geometric conflicts between data flows and sovereignty boundaries</li>
                <li><strong>Cognition Topology Dilemma:</strong> Variations in the deformation rates of scientific consensus across different cognitive spaces</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Topology Dilemma:</strong> Non-uniform distribution of global health resources in a hyper-network structure</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Four: Theoretical Innovations and Contributions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Proposed the "Public Health 4.0" conceptual framework</li>
                <li>Constructed the analytical model of "Health Governance Topology"</li>
                <li>Invented the methodology of "Culture-Adaptive Communication"</li>
                <li>Developed a theoretical assumption of "Quantized Governance"</li>
            </ul>
