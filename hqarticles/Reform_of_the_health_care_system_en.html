            <h2>From "Disease Treatment" to "Health Maintenance": The Shift in Medical Paradigm</h2>
            <p>Human society is undergoing a profound transformation, not only in the paradigm shift within the medical field but also in the innovation of social governance models and the comprehensive arrival of the digital age. The medical revolution from "disease treatment" to "health maintenance," the social governance transformation from "government-led" to "diverse participation," and the digital new paradigm from "isolated governance" to "data interconnectivity" may seem independent but are interconnected and mutually reinforcing, collectively forming a new blueprint for social development.</p>

            <h3>I. From "Disease Treatment" to "Health Maintenance": The Shift in Medical Paradigm</h3>
            <p>For a long time, the core task of medicine has been "disease treatment," with doctors primarily responsible for diagnosing and treating patients. However, with the aging population, the increasing burden of chronic diseases, and changes in lifestyle, the traditional "disease treatment" model is increasingly unable to meet the health challenges of modern society. Medicine is undergoing a quiet revolution, shifting from "disease treatment" to "health maintenance." This revolution is not only a progress in medical technology but also an upgrade in health concepts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Necessity of Health Maintenance:</strong> Globally, the aging population and the rise of chronic diseases have made the traditional "disease treatment" model unsustainable. Chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer are on the rise, while the limitations of medical resources and the increasing costs of healthcare are placing enormous pressure on society. Therefore, shifting the focus forward to strengthen health maintenance has become an inevitable choice to address these challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>The Systemic Nature of Health Maintenance:</strong> "Health maintenance" is not just a matter for the medical field; it is a systemic project requiring collaboration among individuals, families, communities, governments, and healthcare institutions. Individuals should actively learn health knowledge and adopt healthy lifestyles; families should create a harmonious environment and care for mental health; communities should improve health service systems; governments should formulate health policies and tilt medical resources toward grassroots levels; healthcare institutions should shift their service models from disease treatment to health maintenance.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Support for Health Maintenance:</strong> The arrival of the digital age provides new technical support for health maintenance. Through the "Internet + Healthcare" model, medical institutions can offer线上线下combined health consultations, appointment registration, online diagnosis, and other services, improving the accessibility and convenience of health services. Additionally, the application of big data and artificial intelligence technologies enables precise risk prediction and personalized prevention, further promoting the precision and intelligence of health maintenance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. From "Government-Led" to "Diverse Participation": The Transformation of Social Governance Models</h3>
            <p>Corresponding to the medical revolution is the profound transformation of social governance models. Since the reform and opening up, China's social governance has transitioned from a "government-led" to a "diverse participation" model. This transition is not only an update in governance concepts but also a reshaping of the relationship between the state and society.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limitations of the Government-Led Model:</strong> In the early stages of reform and opening up, the "government-led" social governance model provided strong momentum for China's economic and social development. However, with rapid economic and social development and the upgrading of people's demands, the limitations of the government-led model have become increasingly apparent. The government's assumption of excessive management functions has led to high governance costs, declining administrative efficiency, and a mismatch between the singular supply of public services and the diverse social demands.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploration of the Diverse Participation Model:</strong> Entering the new century, China began to explore a "diverse participation" social governance model. This model emphasizes institutional innovation to build a new governance framework of government-society interaction, government-enterprise collaboration, and government-civil cooperation. The government shifts from a comprehensive role to a service-oriented one, taking on responsibilities such as rule-making, public resource investment, and supervision. The diverse participation model has achieved significant results in community governance, environmental protection, and other areas, such as through community resident councils and tripartite governance mechanisms involving enterprises, the public, and the government, enhancing governance efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Support for Diverse Participation:</strong> The arrival of the digital age provides new technical support for the diverse participation model. Through big data and artificial intelligence, the government can more accurately understand social needs and formulate more effective policies. Social organizations and the public can participate in social governance more conveniently through digital platforms, enhancing the breadth and effectiveness of participation. Digital technologies not only break down information silos but also promote positive interactions among the government, market, and society, providing strong technical support for the diverse participation model.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>III. From "Isolated Governance" to "Data Interconnectivity": The New Paradigm of the Digital Age</h3>
            <p>The arrival of the digital age is driving society from the traditional "isolated governance" model to a new paradigm of "data interconnectivity." Data, as a new production factor, is reshaping every aspect of society, driving deep integration across various fields.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limitations of "Isolated Governance":</strong> In the traditional social development model, the phenomenon of information silos is widespread, with poor information互通among various departments and institutions, leading to inefficiency, difficulty in collaboration, and limited innovation. This model made sense in the industrial age but increasingly reveals its drawbacks in the digital age.</li>
                <li><strong>The Essence of "Data Interconnectivity":</strong> "Data interconnectivity" is not simply about data sharing; it is a new social development paradigm. Its core lies in building an open, shared, and collaborative digital ecosystem, achieving interconnectivity, shared use, and value release of data resources. By breaking down information silos, enhancing governance efficiency, promoting social collaboration, and stimulating innovation, "data interconnectivity" is becoming an important engine for driving high-quality social development.</li>
                <li><strong>Pathway to "Data Interconnectivity":</strong> The transition from "isolated governance" to "data interconnectivity" requires the collective efforts of the government, enterprises, and society. Key pathways include improving top-level design, strengthening infrastructure construction, promoting data opening and sharing, enhancing data security protection, and cultivating data talent. These measures can build an open, shared, and collaborative digital ecosystem, providing strong momentum for deep integration across various social fields.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>IV. Conclusion: Building a Digital Society of "Health Maintenance" and "Diverse Participation"</h3>
            <p>The medical revolution from "disease treatment" to "health maintenance," the social governance transformation from "government-led" to "diverse participation," and the digital new paradigm from "isolated governance" to "data interconnectivity" are intertwined and mutually reinforcing, forming a new blueprint for social development. The digital age provides new technical support for health maintenance and diverse participation, while health maintenance and diverse participation provide new value orientations for social development in the digital age. By building a digital society of "health maintenance" and "diverse participation," we can not only address current health challenges and social governance issues but also provide strong momentum for achieving high-quality development and creating a better life. The new paradigm of social development in the digital age is providing solid guarantees for realizing universal health and well-being, social harmony and stability, and the happiness and well-being of the people.</p>
