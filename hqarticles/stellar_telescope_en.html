            <h3>Mysteries of the Night: The Secret Dialogue Between Stellar Telescopes and Dark Matter</h3>
            <p>Dark matter, like a ghost in the universe, is invisible yet omnipresent, affecting every aspect of the cosmos. It is the hidden force behind anomalous rotation curves of galaxies, the enhancer of gravitational lensing effects, and the hidden clue in the cosmic microwave background radiation. The stellar telescope is a crucial tool for us to explore this ghost-like world.</p>
            <p>Through <strong>gravitational lensing effects</strong>, stellar telescopes can detect traces of dark matter in distant galaxy clusters. Light bends when passing massive objects, and the presence of dark matter enhances this effect, causing distortions and deformations in the images of background galaxies. By analyzing these distorted images, astronomers can deduce the distribution and mass of dark matter. For example, the famous "Einstein Cross" phenomenon is a prime example of gravitational lensing, with dark matter playing a critical role behind it.</p>
            <p>Additionally, <strong>galaxy rotation curves</strong> provide robust evidence for the existence of dark matter. Based on our understanding of visible matter, the rotational speed of galaxies should decrease with increasing distance. However, observations show that the rotational speed of outer galaxies remains constant or even increases. This paradox can only be explained by introducing dark matter. The rotation curves observed by stellar telescopes further confirm the existence of dark matter.</p>
            <p><strong>Cosmic microwave background radiation</strong>, the afterglow of the Big Bang, also contains clues about dark matter. By meticulously observing the cosmic microwave background radiation with stellar telescopes, astronomers can analyze its temperature fluctuations, thereby deducing the content and distribution of dark matter. For instance, high-precision measurements by the Planck satellite have provided crucial information about dark matter.</p>
            <p>Although the identity of dark matter remains mysterious, the stellar telescope, as a tool for humanity's exploration of the universe, will continue to help us unveil its secrets, providing vital clues to solving the ultimate mysteries of the universe.</p>

            <h3>The Light of Life: Stellar Telescopes and the Exploration of Exoplanet Habitability</h3>
            <p>Gazing at the stars, the endless dots of light have always inspired human imagination and exploration. With the advancement of technology, our vision has long since transcended the solar system, reaching into the vast cosmic space. In this journey to explore potential interstellar homes, the stellar telescope serves as a wise navigator, guiding us to investigate the habitability of exoplanets and search for the life-sustaining oases in the universe.</p>
            <p><strong>The discovery of exoplanets</strong> marked a significant breakthrough in the history of astronomy. Since the confirmation of the first exoplanet in 1992, thousands of exoplanets have been discovered, including rocky planets similar to Earth. Do these planets have the conditions to nurture life? Do they possess liquid water, suitable temperatures, and atmospheres? These questions are the goals of scientists and the focus of stellar telescopes.</p>
            <p><strong>The transit method</strong> is one of the common methods for discovering exoplanets. When a planet passes in front of its star, it blocks part of the starlight, causing periodic brightness drops. By analyzing these brightness changes, astronomers can deduce the size, orbital period, and other basic information of the planet. For example, the Kepler space telescope discovered thousands of exoplanets using the transit method, including the famous Kepler-452b, an exoplanet highly similar to Earth, which sparked endless speculation about habitable worlds beyond our solar system.</p>
            <p><strong>The radial velocity method</strong> is another effective way to detect exoplanets. The gravitational influence of a planet causes its star to exhibit tiny periodic wobbles, which result in periodic changes in the star's spectrum. By analyzing these spectral changes, astronomers can deduce the planet's mass, orbital inclination, and other information. For instance, the HARPS spectrometer has discovered many exoplanets using the radial velocity method, including some rocky planets located within the habitable zones of their stars, providing crucial clues for studying their habitability.</p>
            <p>Besides discovering exoplanets, stellar telescopes also provide important observational data for studying their habitability. <strong>Atmospheric composition analysis</strong> is a key factor in determining whether an exoplanet is habitable. Molecules such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane are essential for life on Earth, and stellar telescopes can detect the presence of these molecules by analyzing the absorption spectra of planetary atmospheres. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will have the capability to detect the molecular composition of exoplanetary atmospheres, potentially providing crucial clues about their habitability.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, environmental factors such as <strong>cloud cover</strong> and <strong>seasonal variations</strong> are also important considerations in studying exoplanet habitability. Stellar telescopes can analyze a planet's albedo to deduce its cloud cover. Clouds can reflect sunlight, regulate planetary temperatures, and affect atmospheric chemical reactions. Stellar telescopes can also conduct long-term observations to study the seasonal variation patterns of exoplanets, providing valuable data for discovering life-sustaining oases in the universe.</p>

            <h3>The Ultimate Fate of the Universe: Stellar Telescopes and the Dynamic Monitoring of Expansion</h3>
            <p>In the vast universe, distant stars serve as lanterns in the night, transmitting information about cosmic evolution across countless light-years. With increasingly precise stellar telescopes, we can observe the universe with unparalleled detail. These observations not only reveal the composition and history of distant galaxies but also allow us to glimpse the mystery of cosmic expansion. Ultimately, this will guide us to explore the ultimate fate of the universe.</p>
            <p>In 1929, American astronomer Edwin Hubble observed the spectra of distant galaxies and found that most galaxies exhibited redshift, indicating that they were moving away from us. Moreover, the farther away a galaxy was, the faster it moved away. Hubble thus proposed the theory of cosmic expansion and established the famous Hubble's Law. This discovery颠覆了人类对宇宙的认知，开启了人类认识宇宙的新纪元。</p>
            <p>Stellar telescopes are crucial tools for observing cosmic expansion. By observing the spectra of distant galaxies, we can measure their redshift and calculate their recessional speed. The distance to galaxies can be determined by observing their brightness, apparent magnitude, and the period-luminosity relationship of Cepheid variables. Combining speed and distance information, we can plot the Hubble diagram, calculate the Hubble constant, and understand the rate of cosmic expansion. In recent years, technological advancements have enabled telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope, Kepler Space Telescope, and Gaia Space Telescope to provide valuable data on cosmic expansion. The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope is expected to expand our understanding of the distant universe and bring new breakthroughs in cosmic expansion research.</p>
            <p>The dynamic monitoring of cosmic expansion is not only crucial for understanding the origin and evolution of the universe but also directly related to humanity's future fate. By continuously monitoring the rate of cosmic expansion, we can understand the nature of dark energy and speculate on the ultimate fate of the universe. Current observations suggest that dark energy constitutes about 68% of the total energy of the universe. It is a mysterious force that drives the accelerated expansion of the universe. If this expansion continues indefinitely, eventually all galaxies will drift apart, and the universe will become dark and cold, a scenario known as the "Big Rip" hypothesis.</p>
            <p>However, the fate of the universe is not predetermined. In the future, we may find ways to control cosmic expansion or discover new physical laws that alter the trajectory of cosmic evolution. All of this requires us to continue gazing at the stars, using stellar telescopes to explore the universe more deeply.</p>
