            <div class="thought-bubble">
                <h3>"Why Did mRNA Vaccines Suddenly Become Popular?"</h3>
                <p>Traditional inactivated vaccines require cultivating and then inactivating the virus, which is time-consuming. mRNA vaccines directly use genetic instructions, like giving the immune system an operation manual. This turns the human body into a production facility, skipping the virus cultivation step and significantly boosting efficiency.</p>
                <p class="note">*Note: Need to explain the fundamental differences between mRNA and traditional technologies to readers.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="thought-bubble">
                <h3>"What Role Does AI Play in Vaccine Development?"</h3>
                <p>AlphaFold's ability to predict protein structures is indeed impressive—what used to take years of experiments can now be done in hours. But AI's applications may go beyond this: virtual screening of compounds, optimizing clinical trial patient groups, and even simulating virus mutation trends?</p>
                <p class="warning">*Reminder: AI cannot completely replace biological experiments; the complexity of the real world cannot be fully replicated by algorithms.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="thought-bubble">
                <h3>"The Prospects and Fairness of Personalized Vaccines"</h3>
                <p>Cancer mRNA vaccines tailored to genetic mutations may come with exorbitant prices. Currently, mRNA vaccine production is concentrated in developed countries. If the technology becomes more complex in the future, could the wealth gap turn into a "life-and-death gap"?</p>
                <p class="solution">*Solution: Open-source vaccine platforms or patent pool mechanisms might alleviate this issue.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="thought-bubble">
                <h3>"The Privacy Dilemma of Digital Immunity Passports"</h3>
                <p>Using blockchain to store vaccine records sounds cool, but if the database is hacked, not only medical history but also genetic information could be leaked. Is it possible to use zero-knowledge proof technology to verify vaccine status without exposing personal information?</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="thought-bubble">
                <h3>"The Intersection of Anti-Vaccine Movements and Technology"</h3>
                <p>In the past, rumors spread by word of mouth. Now, AI actively pushes anti-science videos, creating echo chambers. Perhaps we should study using the same technology to counter this, such as social platforms' recommendation systems prioritizing science content?</p>
            </div>
        </section>
        
        <section class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Vaccine development is always a double-edged sword: without mRNA technology, we might not have survived the pandemic, but the misuse of gene editing could open Pandora's box. The key is to establish a dialogue mechanism among scientists, policymakers, and the public—unleashing the potential of technology while applying ethical brakes.</p>
