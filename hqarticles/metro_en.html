            <p>During rush hour, the subway is like a moving city, with everyone hurriedly finding their own rhythm. The carriages are crowded with people, each rushing against time.

            <p>Xiaoli stood by the door, gripping the handrail tightly. His mood gradually calmed, and he began to observe the people around him.

            <h2>The Future of Smart Technology</h2>
            <p>The smart development of the subway system is gradually changing the face of urban transportation. Smart ticketing systems, driverless trains, and AI customer service technologies have significantly improved the travel experience of passengers. Smart ticketing systems use facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, and other biometric technologies, eliminating the need for passengers to carry physical tickets and greatly simplifying the boarding process. Driverless trains use advanced sensors and algorithms to ensure safe and efficient operation, reducing human error and costs. AI customer service systems can answer passengers' questions in real-time, providing personalized service and making the travel process more convenient and comfortable.</p>
            <p>These smart technologies not only improve the efficiency of subway operations but also have a profound impact on urban transportation. Smart subway systems can better handle peak passenger flows, reducing congestion and delays, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the city's transportation. Additionally, the application of smart technologies can collect and analyze passenger travel data, providing valuable reference for urban transportation planning and helping city managers formulate more scientific and reasonable transportation policies.</p>

            <h2>The Blossoming of Art</h2>
            <p>The subway is not only a means of transportation but also an important platform for showcasing art. The artistic decorations in subway stations and carriages, such as murals, sculptures, and music, bring visual and auditory enjoyment to passengers.

These artworks not only beautify the subway environment but also provide passengers with a cultural experience, allowing them to appreciate the charm of art during their journey.</p>
            <p>Subway art decorations not only bring aesthetic enjoyment to passengers but also have a positive impact on urban culture.

            <h2>The Vision of Green Travel</h2>
            <p>The subway, as a form of green travel, plays an important role in reducing urban traffic pressure and environmental pollution.
