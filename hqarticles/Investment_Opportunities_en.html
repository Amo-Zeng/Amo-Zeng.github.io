            <h2>1. Background and Current Status</h2>
            <h3>Sustainable Development and ESG Investment</h3>
            <p>ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investment has become central to modern investment strategies. Issues like global climate change, resource depletion, and social inequality compel investors to not only focus on financial returns but also evaluate a company's performance in environmental protection, social responsibility, and corporate governance. ESG investments not only drive companies towards sustainable development but also provide long-term economic benefits for investors.</p>

            <h3>Digital Transformation and the Future of Work</h3>
            <p>Digital transformation involves businesses innovating their business models, operational processes, and corporate culture through technologies like cloud computing, AI, big data analytics, and 5G. This not only increases production efficiency but also creates new business opportunities. With the rise of remote work and automation, work patterns are undergoing fundamental changes, and companies must adapt and lead this trend.</p>

            <h3>Biotechnology and Health Innovation</h3>
            <p>Biotechnology and health innovation leverage interdisciplinary technologies to develop new drugs, treatments, and health management tools aimed at enhancing human health. Breakthroughs in gene editing, mRNA technology, personalized medicine, and digital health management have made biotechnology a hot investment area, particularly in the context of global health crises where its importance and market demand have significantly increased.</p>
