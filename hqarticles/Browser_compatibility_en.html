            <h3>Historical Review: Technological Progress and the Struggle for Standards</h3>
            <p>In the early days of the internet, browser compatibility issues were mainly caused by technological differences between Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer. With the rise of Mozilla Firefox, the browser market began to trend towards standardization, emphasizing adherence to international standards such as W3C. The rapid rise of Google Chrome further reinforced this trend, completely disrupting the market landscape through rapid updates and proactive support for the latest web standards.</p>

            <h3>User Experience-Driven Design: Compatibility and Usability</h3>
            <p>In the digital age, user experience (UX) has become the core of design. Browser compatibility directly affects user experience, ensuring consistency and stability of websites across different browsers is the foundation for enhancing user experience. Designers and developers ensure a consistent and optimized user experience across different browsers through in-depth user research, implementing A/B testing, adopting responsive design, progressive enhancement, and graceful degradation.</p>

            <h3>Future Trends: New Challenges from Emerging Technologies and Compatibility</h3>
            <p>Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT) bring new challenges to browser compatibility. The integration of AI requires advanced computational capabilities and algorithm support, while AR and VR demand higher graphics processing power and interactive interfaces from browsers. The rise of IoT requires browsers to have broader compatibility to adapt to various devices. Facing these challenges, browser manufacturers and web standard organizations are responding through the development of unified standards and optimization of browser engines, while the open-source community and industry are also promoting compatibility innovation and popularization through contributions to open-source projects and strengthening collaboration and exchange.</p>
