            <h2>Makeup and Mental Health: The Psychological Impact of Beauty Therapy</h2>
            <p>Makeup serves as a means of self-expression and confidence enhancement. By carefully selecting and applying cosmetics, we not only shape our external appearance but also convey our inner personality and emotions through color, texture, and form. This self-expression helps us gain a deeper understanding of ourselves, our needs, and desires, thereby boosting our confidence and self-worth. Additionally, makeup acts as a tool to cope with stress and anxiety, providing psychological comfort through its ritualistic nature, which helps us relax and alleviate anxiety. Finally, appropriate makeup can facilitate social interactions and the formation of relationships, improving first impressions and laying the foundation for good interpersonal relations.</p>

Increased consumer awareness and strengthened regulations are key drivers of sustainable beauty development. Technological innovations, such as the application of biotechnology and improvements in production processes, as well as industry collaborations, such as partnerships across companies and public-private partnerships, are effective ways to achieve sustainable beauty.

            <h2>Makeup Art: From Everyday Makeup to Digital Creation</h2>
            <p>Makeup art has evolved from everyday makeup to digital creation. Everyday makeup uses color and light and shadow techniques to create a harmonious facial contour, with its skills and styles constantly evolving with the times. In the digital realm, makeup art uses technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality to create surreal makeup effects. The rise of digital creation has promoted cross-disciplinary integration in makeup art, with makeup artists collaborating with photographers, visual artists, animators, and other creative professionals to explore new roles for makeup in visual storytelling, creating dynamic and interactive art pieces.</p>
