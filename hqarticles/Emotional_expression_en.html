                <h2>Introduction: Emotion as a Constructed Interface</h2>
                <p>Traditional psychology often views emotions as direct expressions of an individual's inner world—love, sadness, anger, joy, seemingly like emotional streams naturally emerging from the depths of the soul. However, when re-examining emotions from the intersecting perspectives of cognitive science, philosophy, and sociology, we find that they are never purely "inner experiences" but an <strong>interface</strong> constructed by multiple structures: connecting individuals with time, individuals with groups, and individuals with their bodies, constantly being <strong>structured, obscured, and reconstructed</strong> within the interweaving of neural mechanisms, social networks, and sensory experiences.</p>
                
                <p>This article proposes the theoretical framework of the "triple structural mechanisms of emotion," understanding emotion as a product of three structural forces:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Spatiotemporal Anchors</strong>—Emotion as the brain's compressed cognitive mapping of complex temporal experiences;</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Topology</strong>—Emotion as a distributed interface for interaction between individual and collective unconsciousness;</li>
                    <li><strong>Body Grammar</strong>—Emotion as an embodied cognitive system integrating multisensory metaphors.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>These three mechanisms do not exist in isolation but interpenetrate and support each other, collectively forming the deep structure of emotions. Understanding this framework not only helps us transcend the superficial perception of "emotion as feeling" but also points to a possibility: <strong>through conscious practice, individuals can participate in the reconstruction of emotions, achieving a shift from passive bearing to active writing</strong>.</p>

                <h2>I. Spatiotemporal Anchors: Emotion as a Neural Mechanism for Cognitive Compression</h2>
                <p>Emotion is first and foremost a <strong>time management strategy</strong>. The brain cannot process an infinitely extended flow of time, so it compresses complex temporal experiences into quickly accessible "cognitive anchors" through emotions. Neuroscientific research shows that the hippocampus and the default mode network (DMN) play key roles in this process: the hippocampus prioritizes the encoding of emotionally charged events, marking them as "important nodes"; the DMN integrates these nodes during rest, constructing a coherent life narrative.</p>
                
                <p>Take trauma as an example: a car accident might be compressed into sensory fragments like "a loud crash + flying glass," with other details becoming blurred. This compression is both a cognitive saving mechanism and a protective mechanism—it prevents the brain from continuously immersing itself in traumatic details. However, this mechanism can also lead to <strong>distorted time perception</strong>: patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often experience "time stagnation," where the past constantly intrudes upon the present; while "deadline anxiety" in the workplace compresses long work cycles into "sprint moments," reconstructing memory structures.</p>
                
                <p>Paul Ricoeur's philosophy of time further reveals that emotional anchors are the adhesive for narrative construction. In personal oral histories, trauma often becomes a demarcation point of "before and after" in life, while hope becomes a symbolic node for "starting over." The emotion of regret particularly embodies this function: it compresses complex decision-making processes into an anchor of "wrong choice" and衍生出 (derives) imaginations of "parallel timelines," achieving simplified management of temporality.</p>
                
                <p>However, this compression also brings risks: <strong>emotional anchors may solidify distorted spatiotemporal views</strong>. In the age of social media, instant feedback like likes and shares compresses time into "burst moments," users chase short-term emotional刺激 (stimuli), weakening the ability for long-term deep thinking. This "instantaneous" time culture is reshaping the cognitive rhythm of the entire society.</p>

                    <p>Although spatiotemporal anchors enhance cognitive efficiency, they may also obscure the complexity and fluidity of time. Individuals need to realize that emotional anchors are not true maps of time but simplified models of the brain.</p>

                <h2>II. Social Topology: Emotion as a Distributed Interface for Collective Unconsciousness</h2>
                <p>Emotion is not only a product of individual cognition but also a <strong>social topological structure</strong>. In the digital age, emotion, through the nodes and paths of social networks, becomes an interface for interaction between individual and collective consciousness. Jung's theory of the collective unconscious points out that emotion is the direct presentation of archetypes (e.g., shadow, hero) in social interactions; while social network analysis reveals that emotional传播 (transmission) follows the laws of complex systems: node centrality determines influence, transmission paths determine the scope of diffusion, and phase transition critical points determine爆发 (outbreak) possibilities.</p>
                
                <p>The polarization of anger on microblog hot searches is a typical case. High-centrality users activate the "shadow archetype" through labeled narratives, simplifying complex contradictions into a battle between good and evil, triggering全网 (whole-network) resonance. Social network analysis shows that the emotional transmission in such events follows a "power-law distribution": a few nodes hold most of the influence, while the majority of nodes reinforce emotions through imitation, eventually leading to the polarization of the public opinion field. Individual emotions are <strong>obscured</strong> in this process—users believe they are expressing themselves, but in reality, they are playing roles assigned by the topological structure.</p>
                
                <p>Ritualized sadness demonstrates how emotions are reconstructed into adhesives for collective identity through topological structures. Nationwide mourning activities during the pandemic formed highly ritualized emotional scripts on social media: black profile pictures, candle icons, standardized悼文 (eulogies). These symbols activate the "hero archetype" and "sacrifice narrative," sublimating personal loss into collective meaning production. However, personal grief that cannot be accommodated by this script (such as质疑 (questioning) of the system) is marginalized, emotion becoming what Foucault called a "governance technique."</p>
                
                <p>The emotional mobilization in social movements further reveals the "phase transition" mechanism of topological structures. Early dissatisfaction accumulates through weak connections; when network density reaches a critical point, key events may trigger全网 (whole-network) resonance, shifting the movement from online to offline. Emotion here becomes a double-edged sword:它既 (it both) promotes social change and may reduce individuals to anonymous nodes in the topological structure.</p>
                
                <div class="critical-reflection">
                    <h4>Critical Reflection</h4>
                    <p>The social nature of emotion is not innate but shaped by network structures. Individuals need to be vigilant about the regulation of emotional expression by algorithm recommendations and group norms, maintaining reflective space for individuality when participating in resonance.</p>

                <h2>III. Body Grammar: Emotion as an Embodied System of Multisensory Metaphors</h2>
                <p>The third structure of emotion is the <strong>body</strong>. From the perspectives of embodied cognition and perceptual symbol theory, emotion is not an abstract psychological state but a "metaphorical body grammar" formed after multisensory information is integrated by the nervous system. Lakoff and Johnson's metaphor theory points out that abstract concepts are structured through bodily experiences; Barsalou's perceptual symbol systems theory further indicates that concepts are stored in the form of multimodal simulations, with emotions particularly relying on cross-sensory metaphors.</p>
                
                <p>"Heartbreak" is a typical multisensory metaphor: it integrates tactile (shattering sensation), somatosensory (chest tightness), and even auditory (imagination of breaking sound) experiences. The insular cortex, as the interoception center, integrates these signals into embodied emotional representations. Neuroimaging research shows that the insula is highly active in complex social emotions like empathy, disgust, and shame, its operation often being automatic, pre-reflective, and不易 (not easily) detected by the individual.</p>
                
                <p>Culture acts like a filter, shaping the specific expressions of body grammar. Eastern "shame" often manifests as facial heat, averted gaze, and lowered body posture; Western "guilt"更多 (more often)表现为 (manifests as) spatial metaphors like "weight of conscience" or "falling from a height." This difference is not only reflected in language but also in neural activation patterns. Culture internalizes emotional grammar into bodily habits through socialization processes, obscuring the original diversity of bodily experiences.</p>
                
                <p>However, body grammar is plastic. Body-oriented therapies in trauma treatment help individuals重建 (reconstruct) safe perceptual grammar by重新觉察 (re-noticing) bodily reactions; dance therapy encourages using movement metaphors for emotional states, reconstructing emotional meaning through different posture simulations; meditation and mindfulness practices enhance awareness and control of internal bodily states by training interoceptive attention. Research finds that long-term meditators have increased insular cortex thickness, indicating improved emotional regulation ability.</p>

                    <h4>Critical Reflection</h4>
                    <p>The body is not only the carrier of emotion but also the field where its grammatical rules are written. Individuals can achieve "rewriting" of emotional encoding through conscious bodily practices.</p>

                <h2>IV. Interaction of the Triple Mechanisms: The Structural Network of Emotion</h2>
                <p>These three mechanisms are not isolated but interpenetrate and support each other, forming a <strong>structural network of emotion</strong>:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Spatiotemporal Anchors</strong> provide the <strong>cognitive framework</strong> for emotion: they determine which moments are marked as "important," thus influencing their传播价值 (transmission value) in social networks and the intensity of bodily memory;</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Topology</strong> provides the <strong>transmission paths</strong> for emotion: through nodes and paths, it transforms individual emotional anchors into collective narratives and conversely shapes the individual's cognitive compression methods (e.g., "instantaneousism" on social media);</li>
                    <li><strong>Body Grammar</strong> provides the <strong>perceptual foundation</strong> for emotion: through multisensory metaphors, it enables abstract emotional anchors and social scripts to be experienced by the body, and in turn affects their encoding and storage in the brain.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>For example, on social media, an "anger event" is first compressed by the individual's brain into a cognitive anchor (temporal mechanism), then transmitted through the social network into a collective emotion (social mechanism), and finally embodied through bodily reactions like "chest tightness" and "clenched teeth" (bodily mechanism). The three interact cyclically, forming a positive feedback loop for emotion.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion and Outlook: The Possibility of Emotional Liberation</h2>
                <p>Emotion has never been a purely internal feeling but an <strong>interface</strong> jointly constructed by spatiotemporal structures, social networks, and bodily experiences. Understanding its triple structural mechanisms not only reveals how emotions are obscured and disciplined but also points to a possibility: <strong>emotional liberation</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>This liberation is not about escaping emotions but participating in the reconstruction of emotions through conscious practice:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>On the <strong>temporal dimension</strong>, through narrative reflection, break the固化 (solidification) of emotional anchors, and rebuild a more fluid life story;</li>
                    <li>On the <strong>social dimension</strong>, through algorithm critique and exposure to heterogeneous information, resist the obscuration of emotional topology, and maintain reflective space for individuality;</li>
                    <li>On the <strong>bodily dimension</strong>, through dance, meditation, and trauma healing, reconstruct body grammar, and achieve rewriting of emotional encoding.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Future research needs to further explore how to balance the efficiency and authenticity of emotional structures, finding freer ways of existence within complex spatiotemporal. Only by maintaining a dialectic between structure and agency can emotion truly become a channel to understanding rather than迷失 (loss)—transforming from passive bearers to active writers.</p>
                
                <div class="final-proposition">
                    <h4>Final Proposition</h4>
                    <p>Emotion is not something we "have," but a process we "participate in constructing." True freedom begins with清醒认知 (clear awareness) of this process.</p>
