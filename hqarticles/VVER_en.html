            <h3>1. Geopolitical Perspective: Global Expansion of VVER Technology and the Reshaping of International Relations</h3>
            <p>The export of VVER technology is not only a crucial source of revenue for Russia's nuclear industry but also a key tool for expanding its geopolitical influence. By exporting VVER technology to countries like Turkey, India, and China, Russia not only secures substantial economic benefits but also establishes long-term technical dependency relationships with these nations, thereby gaining greater political and diplomatic leverage.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technology Export and Economic Benefits:</strong> Russia's export of VVER technology not only solidifies its influence in the global energy sector but also deepens energy cooperation with recipient countries through nuclear project collaborations.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Independence and Geopolitical Leverage:</strong> For countries that adopt VVER technology, the introduction of this technology helps achieve energy independence and reduces reliance on fossil fuels.</li>
                <li><strong>Competition in the Global Nuclear Market and Standard Disputes:</strong> The global expansion of VVER technology directly competes with nuclear technologies from Western countries, necessitating Russia to make greater efforts in meeting international nuclear safety standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Geopolitical Alliances and Confrontations:</strong> Russia strengthens its cooperative relationships with friendly countries by exporting VVER technology, consolidating its political and geostrategic position in these regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Nuclear Diplomacy and Soft Power Enhancement:</strong> The export of VVER technology is not only an economic and technical collaboration but also a tool of "nuclear diplomacy," enhancing Russia's international image and soft power.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact on the Global Nuclear Landscape:</strong> The global expansion of VVER technology is gradually reshaping the global nuclear landscape, promoting the diversification of the global nuclear market.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Cultural Exchange Perspective: The Role of VVER as a Cultural Bridge in Sino-Russian Nuclear Cooperation</h3>
            <p>The export of VVER technology is not only a process of technical collaboration but also a journey of cultural exchange and mutual trust between China and Russia. Through VVER projects, both countries have established deep cooperative foundations in technical trust, cross-cultural communication, talent cultivation, technological innovation, and cultural identity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Establishment of Technical and Cultural Trust:</strong> VVER projects serve as a platform for establishing technical and cultural trust between China and Russia.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Cultural Communication and Collaboration:</strong> Nuclear energy cooperation requires both parties to reach a consensus on technical standards, project management, and cultural practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Talent Cultivation and Cultural Propagation:</strong> VVER projects are not only a process of technology transfer but also a journey of talent cultivation and cultural propagation.</li>
                <li><strong>Sharing of Technological Innovation and Cultural Fusion:</strong> During the implementation of VVER projects, both China and Russia jointly face technical challenges, engaging in collaborative technical improvements and innovations.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Identity and Promotion of Long-Term Cooperation:</strong> The successful implementation of VVER projects not only brings economic benefits to both China and Russia but also deepens mutual cultural identity.</li>
            </ul>
