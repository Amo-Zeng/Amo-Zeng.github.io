            <h3>The Intersection of Scientific Exploration and Artistic Desire: The Birth of IMAX</h3>
            <p>The birth of IMAX stems from humanity's exploration of perceptual limits and the desire for the unknown. In the 1960s, a Canadian scientific team researching astronomical phenomena sought not just observation but a way to fully present the vastness and magnificence of the universe. This pursuit of ultimate experiences led to the creation of IMAX. Scientists combined giant curved screens with improved projection equipment, creating an immersive movie-watching experience that envelops the audience completely. IMAX is not just a technical invention but also a revolution in artistic forms—transforming the audience from passive story bystanders into immersive participants. This transformation marked a new era in the pursuit of audiovisual experiences.</p>
