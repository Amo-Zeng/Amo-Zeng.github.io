            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Against the backdrop of the deep integration of digital technology and globalization, the global economic landscape is undergoing profound transformations, and regional integration is facing unprecedented development opportunities. As one of the most dynamic and promising regions in the world, ASEAN is actively embracing the digital era, with "Digital ASEAN" as a strategic抓手, driving regional integration to new heights. However, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has not only caused enormous impacts on the global economy and society but also exposed the shortcomings of ASEAN in public health, economic structure, and governance capability. At the same time, the pandemic has also provided new opportunities for ASEAN's resilience building, sustainable recovery, and inclusive development in the post-pandemic era. In this context, the cooperation between China and ASEAN has ushered in new opportunities and challenges, and the concept of the "Community of Common Destiny" provides strategic guidance for deepening cooperation between the two sides. This article will explore ASEAN's development vision and path for 2030 from three dimensions: regional integration in the digital era, resilience and recovery in the post-pandemic era, and the construction of the China-ASEAN Community of Common Destiny.</p>

            <h2>1. Digital ASEAN: The Accelerator of Regional Integration</h2>
            <h3>1. Digital Engine Driving ASEAN Economic Integration</h3>
            <p>Currently, ASEAN's digital economy has taken initial shape and is playing an increasingly important role in the process of regional economic integration. With the gradual improvement of digital infrastructure such as 5G networks and data centers, the development foundation of ASEAN's digital economy is becoming increasingly solid. The rapid rise of new service trade forms such as cross-border e-commerce, digital payments, and cloud computing has become a new engine driving ASEAN's economic growth. At the same time, ASEAN countries are increasing their efforts to cultivate digital talents, providing solid intellectual support for the sustainable development of the digital economy.</p>
            <p>However, the development of ASEAN's digital economy still faces many challenges. First, the digital divide is still significant, with varying levels of digital economic development among countries, and some lagging behind in digital infrastructure construction and application. Second, digital governance capability needs to be improved, as cybersecurity threats and data privacy issues are becoming increasingly complex, posing major obstacles to the development of the digital economy. Finally, the digital economy rule system has not yet been fully established, and the lack of regional unified systems制约 the in-depth development of the digital economy, necessitating enhanced policy coordination and cooperation.</p>
            <h3>2. New Opportunities for China-ASEAN Digital Economic Cooperation</h3>
            <p>As a global leader in the digital economy, China has enormous cooperation potential with ASEAN in this field. The two sides can deepen cooperation in the following areas to achieve mutual benefits and win-win outcomes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cross-border E-commerce</strong>: China's large consumer market complements ASEAN's rich special products. Through cross-border e-commerce platforms, both sides can integrate resources, jointly explore global markets, and promote trade facilitation.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Cities</strong>: China has accumulated rich experience in smart city construction, especially in areas such as smart transportation and smart healthcare. ASEAN can learn from China's successful experience through cooperation, accelerate the pace of smart city construction, and improve urban management efficiency and residents' quality of life.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Payments</strong>: China's digital payment development is at the forefront of the world, with mobile payments and e-wallets widely applied. ASEAN can cooperate with China to promote digital payment methods, enhance cross-border payment efficiency, and facilitate trade and investment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. The Vision of "Digital ASEAN"</h3>
            <p>By 2030, "Digital ASEAN" will become an important engine driving the in-depth development of regional integration. To this end, ASEAN should focus on the following aspects: First, build a digital economy cooperation platform to promote the coordinated development of member states in digital technology and digital services; Second, strengthen policy coordination and law enforcement cooperation in areas such as cybersecurity and data protection, building a regional digital governance framework; Third, promote digital inclusive development, narrow the digital divide, and ensure that the fruits of digital economic development benefit more people, especially vulnerable groups.</p>

            <h2>2. ASEAN in the Post-Pandemic Era: Resilience, Recovery, and Sustainable Development</h2>
            <h3>1. Multiple Challenges Under the Impact of the Pandemic</h3>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the economies, societies, and governance systems of ASEAN countries. The severe setbacks in tourism and supply chains highlighted the vulnerability of ASEAN's economic dependence on external factors; the shortcomings in public health systems exposed the inadequacies in emergency management and resource allocation; and the exacerbation of social inequality revealed the weak links in the social security system. These challenges not only threaten ASEAN's short-term recovery but also pose a severe test for its mid- to long-term sustainable development.</p>
            <h3>2. Green Recovery and Digital Transformation</h3>
            <p>Facing the impact of the pandemic, ASEAN countries have accumulated valuable lessons and started to take green recovery and digital transformation as important grips for economic recovery. Countries like Vietnam and Thailand are actively promoting investment in renewable energy projects, committed to achieving long-term sustainable development through green economic transformation. At the same time, the wide application of digital technology has also injected new momentum into ASEAN's economic recovery. The rapid popularization of emerging business forms such as online office, e-commerce, and digital payments has propelled ASEAN countries' economic digitalization process, laying the foundation for future economic growth.</p>
            <h3>3. Social Resilience and Inclusive Development</h3>
            <p>During the pandemic, ASEAN countries strengthened the construction of the social security system, especially support measures for low-income groups and informal employment, demonstrating the importance of social resilience. In the future, ASEAN should further promote inclusive development, narrow social inequality, and ensure that economic recovery benefits more people, especially vulnerable groups. At the same time, the improvement of the social security system will also provide a solid foundation for ASEAN's sustainable development in the post-pandemic era.</p>

            <h2>3. Opportunities and Challenges of the China-ASEAN Community of Common Destiny</h2>
            <h3>1. Achievements and Potential of Cooperation</h3>
            <p>Since the establishment of dialogue relations between China and ASEAN in 1991, the two sides have achieved significant results in areas such as economic cooperation, infrastructure construction, and cultural exchanges. ASEAN has remained China's largest trading partner for many years, and the smooth progress of "Belt and Road" projects such as the China-Laos Railway and the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway has not only promoted the economic development of ASEAN countries but also set a model for regional connectivity. In the future, with the full implementation of the RCEP agreement and the deepening of digital economic cooperation, the cooperation potential between China and ASEAN will be further released.</p>
            <h3>2. Challenges in Building the Community of Common Destiny</h3>
            <p>Despite the significant achievements of cooperation, the construction of the China-ASEAN Community of Common Destiny still faces many challenges. The complexities of geopolitical games, the intensification of economic structural differences and competition, cultural identity differences and social cognitive barriers, as well as the rise of regional security risks, are all issues that both sides need to jointly address. In addition, how to properly handle sensitive issues (such as the South China Sea dispute) while deepening cooperation is also a topic that both sides need to pay close attention to.</p>
            <h3>3. Future Directions for Deepening the Community of Common Destiny</h3>
            <p>In the future, China and ASEAN should deepen cooperation in the following areas: First, deepen political mutual trust, properly handle sensitive issues, and ensure the stable and healthy development of bilateral relations; Second, expand economic cooperation, promote the full implementation of RCEP, and deepen cooperation in emerging fields, especially digital economy and green economy; Third, strengthen cultural exchanges, enhance mutual understanding among the people, and consolidate public opinion; Fourth, maintain regional security, jointly address non-traditional security challenges such as climate change, cybersecurity, and public health threats; Fifth, enhance international cooperation, issue more coordinated voices in global governance, and promote the establishment of a more just and reasonable international order.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Looking ahead to 2030, ASEAN will drive the in-depth development of regional integration through "Digital ASEAN" under the impetus of the digital era, while building a more resilient economic system amid the increasing global uncertainties, achieving sustainable recovery and inclusive development. The construction of the China-ASEAN Community of Common Destiny not only aligns with the common interests of both sides but also makes important contributions to the peace and development of the Asia-Pacific region and the world. By deepening cooperation and overcoming challenges, ASEAN and China will surely create a new situation for regional integration and move towards an even closer and more dynamic future.</p>
