            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Westerns, a quintessential genre in American cinema, have long held a significant place in the global film industry for their depiction of the wilderness and the profound portrayal of heroism. However, as time evolves, the narrative styles and themes of Westerns have been subtly transforming. This article delves into three dimensions: the reconstruction of environmental narratives, the collision and integration of multiculturalism, and the technological dilemma. It examines how modern Westerns innovate while preserving tradition, prompting viewers to reflect deeply on the relationships between humans and nature, cultural diversity, and the intersection of technology and wilderness.</p>

            <h3>1. Reconstruction of Environmental Narratives: Ecological Thinking from Confrontation to Symbiosis</h3>
            <h4>Environmental Narratives in Traditional Westerns: The Wilderness as a Symbol of Confrontation</h4>
            <p>In traditional Westerns, the wilderness is often portrayed as an untamed and savage land, with the confrontation between the hero and the environment forming the core of the narrative. Vast deserts, canyons, and grasslands serve not only as the backdrop but also as symbols of character traits and destinies. This narrative simplifies nature as an object for human conquest, overlooking its complexity and vitality.</p>
            <h4>Environmental Awakening in Modern Westerns: Nature as a Living Character</h4>
            <p>In modern Westerns, the natural environment is no longer merely a backdrop but is endowed with a life of its own, interacting and dialoguing with humans. Taking *The Revenant* (2015) as an example, the film uses nuanced cinematography to showcase the cruelty and beauty of the natural environment, revealing the complex relationship between humans and nature.</p>
            <h4>Symbiosis and Harmony: Ecological Ethics from Confrontation to Coexistence</h4>
            <p>Modern Westerns depict the process of humans and nature moving from confrontation to symbiosis by illustrating the destruction caused by human activities and nature's "revenge." Taking *True Grit* (2010) as an example, the film conveys a new ecological ethic through meticulous character development and environmental description: humans should not conquer nature but coexist with it.</p>
            <h4>Microscopic Perspective: The Vulnerability of Wildlife and Ecosystems</h4>
            <p>In addition to macro-environmental narratives, modern Westerns focus on wildlife in the wilderness to showcase the fragility of ecosystems. Taking *Into the Wild* (2007) as an example, the film highlights the insignificance and ignorance of humans in the face of nature, while also prompting viewers to consider ecological protection.</p>

            <h3>2. The Collision and Integration of Multiculturalism: A Reexamination of Western History</h3>
            <h4>Limitations of Traditional Westerns: The Monolithic Narrative of White Colonizers</h4>
            <p>Traditional Westerns often center on the perspective of white colonizers, marginalizing or demonizing indigenous peoples and other minority groups, thereby ignoring the complexity and diversity of Western history.</p>
            <h4>Multiple Perspectives in Modern Westerns: The Representation of Cultural Diversity</h4>
            <p>Modern Westerns introduce the perspectives of indigenous peoples, African Americans, Mexicans, and other ethnic groups, showcasing the diversity and complexity of Western history. Taking *Dead Man* (1995) as an example, the film depicts the collision between indigenous culture and white colonial culture through the journey of a white male protagonist.</p>
            <h4>Decolonization Narratives: Reflecting on Power Relations and Cultural Hegemony</h4>
            <p>Modern Westerns reflect on the history of Western colonialism, exploring the power dynamics between colonizers and the colonized, as well as the impact of cultural hegemony on indigenous cultures. Taking *Dances with Wolves* (1990) as an example, the film reveals the violence of colonialism and the richness of indigenous cultures through the interaction between a white army officer and the Sioux tribe.</p>
            <h4>Cultural Symbiosis: Harmonious Coexistence of Multiculturalism</h4>
            <p>Modern Westerns illustrate the coexistence and integration of different cultures in the Western wilderness. Taking *Legends of the Fall* (1994) as an example, the film portrays the trade and cultural exchange between indigenous peoples and white colonizers through the story of a family.</p>

            <h3>3. The Technological Dilemma: The Eternal Collision Between Machines and Wilderness</h3>
            <h4>The Dual Role of Technology: Connecting and Tearing Apart</h4>
            <p>In Westerns, technologies such as steam locomotives, telegraph machines, and revolvers serve as both the bonds connecting the East and West and the instruments tearing apart the original order. Taking *The Wild Bunch* (1969) as an example, the introduction of steam locomotives not only revolutionized logistics but also disrupted the existing ecological balance in the West.</p>
            <h4>The Invasion of Technology: Disruption of Ecological Balance</h4>
            <p>The invasion of technology not only altered the economic structure of Western society but also disrupted the original ecological balance. Taking *Once Upon a Time in the West* (1968) as an example, the construction of railroads transformed the geographical landscape and changed people's lifestyles and values.</p>
            <h4>The Limitations of Technology: The Resistance of Wilderness and Human Reflection</h4>
            <p>In Westerns, technology is not an invincible conqueror; the wilderness continually resists the intrusion of external civilizations in its unique way. Taking *The Revenant* (2015) as an example, the protagonist's survival challenge in the wilderness tests not only personal will but also the limitations of human capabilities.</p>
