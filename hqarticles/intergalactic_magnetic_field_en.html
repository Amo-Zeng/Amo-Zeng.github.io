            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Intergalactic Magnetic Field (IGMF) is one of the most elusive structures in the universe, with its influence spanning from galaxy formation and evolution, to the dynamics of interstellar dust, to the complex physical processes in galaxy collisions and mergers. IGMF is ubiquitous and has profound impacts. This article will comprehensively discuss the methods of multi-dimensional simulation of IGMF and its integration with observational data, delving into how magnetic fields play their multiple roles in the cosmos.</p>

            <h3>I. Breakthroughs in Multi-dimensional Simulation Methods</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Four-dimensional Simulation: Incorporating Time Dimension</strong></p>
            <p>Four-dimensional simulations introduce the time dimension, allowing us to observe the dynamic evolution of magnetic fields on a cosmic scale. This approach not only reveals how magnetic fields change with cosmic expansion but also provides a deep understanding of the role of magnetic fields in galaxy formation and evolution. By processing large amounts of data and complex computational models, four-dimensional simulations show how magnetic fields shape galaxy structures and star formation processes at different cosmic times.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Topological Data Analysis (TDA)</strong></p>
            <p>Topological Data Analysis helps us understand the complexity and connectivity of IGMF by identifying and analyzing topological structures like loops, holes, and connectivity within magnetic fields. The application of TDA not only identifies topological defects in the magnetic fields but also reveals structural patterns from macroscopic to microscopic scales, offering a new perspective on the evolution and distribution of magnetic fields.</p>

            <h3>II. Interaction Between Observation and Simulation</h3>
            <p>Combining multi-dimensional simulation with actual observational data, such as from radio telescopes, X-ray telescopes, and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation observations, can refine models and enhance the accuracy of predictions. Through data-driven simulation optimization and establishing feedback loops, observational data guide simulations, and simulation results in turn optimize observational strategies, forming a cycle that progressively improves the accuracy and reliability of research.</p>

            <p>The intergalactic magnetic field not only influences the formation of gas clouds but also alters the paths and aggregation modes of interstellar dust through various mechanical mechanisms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Magnetic Field Capture Effect:</strong> The bending and twisting of magnetic field lines change the trajectory of dust particles, forming unique dust structures.</li>
                <li><strong>Magnetic Field Compression:</strong> Magnetic fields compress gas clouds, affecting the distribution of dust particles, forming dust clouds or filamentary structures.</li>
                <li><strong>Magnetically Driven Turbulence:</strong> Through magnetohydrodynamic effects, magnetic fields drive turbulent motion in gas and dust, promoting collisions and aggregation of dust.</li>
            </ul>
