            <h3>I. Underground Space Reconstruction: The Foundation of Urban Sustainability</h3>
            <p>With the acceleration of global urbanization, the reconstruction of underground space has become crucial to solving urban development bottlenecks. Through systematic planning and technological innovation, underground space can not only effectively alleviate the tension of surface land resources but also enhance the overall function and disaster resistance capacity of the city.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Effective Utilization of Land Resources</strong>: The development of underground space can transfer some urban functions to underground, such as transportation systems, commercial facilities, living areas, and energy storage. This transformation not only achieves the expansion and optimization of urban functions but also efficiently utilizes land resources without expanding surface area.</li>
                <li><strong>Addressing Traffic Congestion</strong>: The construction of underground transportation networks can divert ground traffic flow and reduce congestion. Efficient transportation methods, such as underground high-speed transportation systems, subways, and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), will significantly enhance urban overall traffic efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduction of Environmental Pollution</strong>: Moving part of the infrastructure and functions underground can reduce the impact of human activities on the environment on the surface. For example, underground energy storage systems can lower air and noise pollution, protecting the natural ecological environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Defense Against Natural Disasters</strong>: The use of underground space can also enhance the city's disaster resistance capacity. In the event of natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, underground facilities can provide safer refuge space, ensuring the safety of residents' lives.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h3>II. Design Friendly for Vulnerable Groups: The Foundation of an Inclusive Society</h3>
            <p>The planning of future cities must consider the needs of vulnerable groups from the outset, building an inclusive society where everyone can find a sense of belonging and opportunities, regardless of age, gender, physical condition, or socio-economic status.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forward-Thinking Diversity and Inclusion</strong>: Future city design should break traditional design inertia, adopting a holistic perspective to examine and meet the needs of various groups. This includes not only physically disabled or elderly individuals but also economically vulnerable groups, low-income families, and those with psychological or social barriers.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration of Intelligence and Humanization</strong>: Technological progress offers great potential to support vulnerable groups in future cities. Intelligent facilities can greatly enhance the mobility freedom of the disabled, for example, smart wheelchairs and automated navigation systems can provide safe and efficient travel solutions for the visually impaired. Smart home systems can provide round-the-clock monitoring and assistance for the elderly and disabled, ensuring their quality of life and safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Universal Accessibility</strong>: Future cities should promote comprehensive accessibility design standards to ensure that all public spaces and services are easily accessible. From building entrances and public transportation to the accessibility of information systems, attention to detail can greatly improve the quality of life for vulnerable groups. Through education and public awareness campaigns, enhancing society's understanding and importance of accessibility design will help create a more friendly and inclusive environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Support and Collaborative Efforts</strong>: Community support is an indispensable component of a vulnerable group-friendly city. Future city design should include the construction of community spaces, which are not only physical environments but also social interaction and support systems. Collaboration among government, non-governmental organizations, businesses, and individuals can pool resources, jointly promoting vulnerable-friendly urban transformation projects, increasing the sustainability and widespread applicability of such projects.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>III. Surreal Sensory Experiences: The Marvelous Dimension of Future Cities</h3>
            <p>In the grand blueprint of future cities, surreal sensory experiences provide us with an entrance to transcend time and space, leading us into a new dimension full of endless possibilities. In this dimension, human perception will be extended and reshaped to an unprecedented extent, creating an experience beyond reality.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extension of Senses: From Five Senses to Multi-Senses</strong>: Future cities will not only satisfy the traditional five senses of vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch but also push sensory experiences to the extreme through advanced technology. With embedded nanosensors, city residents can perceive electromagnetic waves in the microscopic world or directly "see" ultraviolet and infrared rays through smart glasses. This sensory expansion is not just a technological triumph but also an extension of human cognitive boundaries.</li>
                <li><strong>Immersive Experiences: Fusion of Virtual and Reality</strong>: In future cities, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies will no longer be mere entertainment tools but part of everyday life. Every corner of the city could be a starting point for immersive experiences. Walking through ancient streets with AR glasses, you can "see" the reenactment of history, or through VR technology, instantly teleport to distant planets, experiencing the mystery of outer space. This fusion of virtual and reality breaks the limits of time and space, allowing people to freely穿梭 between different scenarios.</li>
                <li><strong>Harmonization of Senses: Multi-Sensory Synchronized Experiences</strong>: Future cities will strive to create multi-sensory synchronized experiences, allowing people to feel multiple sensory stimuli simultaneously. For example, a music concert will not only be a feast for the ears but also integrate touch, smell, and vision. The audience can not only hear the music but also feel the vibrations of the notes, smell the aroma matching the music, and even see the color changes of the music. This multi-sensory synchronized experience will greatly enrich people's perceptual world and enhance the quality of life.</li>
                <li><strong>Healing of Senses: The Dialogue Between Technology and the Soul</strong>: In the surreal sensory experiences, future cities will also focus on the healing function of senses. Through precise sensory adjustment technology, cities will provide personalized psychological treatment and relaxation experiences for residents. For example, specific combinations of sound waves and light can help people relieve anxiety and stress; or by simulating natural environment sounds and smells, help people find inner peace in the city. This dialogue between technology and the soul not only enhances residents' well-being but also provides new paths for sustainable urban development.</li>
            </ul>
