            <h2>Spatial Layout of Eco-Industrial Parks and Global Geographic Restructuring in the Context of Industry 4.0: The Role of Multinational Corporations</h2>
            <p>With the acceleration of global economic integration, the concept of Industry 4.0 has emerged, driving a shift from traditional industrial production models to smart, automated, and digitized ones. This transformation not only affects production technologies but also reshapes the spatial layout of global industrial geography. In this context, eco-industrial parks (EIPs) as a form of intensive, sustainable production are redefining the relationship between industry and geographic space, with multinational corporations playing a pivotal role in this process.</p>

            <h3>Spatial Layout of Eco-Industrial Parks</h3>
            <p>Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs) bring together companies from different industries to promote resource sharing, waste recycling, and the application of environmentally friendly technologies. Their spatial layout not only considers production efficiency but also ecological balance and environmental protection. For example, through strategic planning, companies within the park can share energy resources, reducing energy consumption; through waste exchange systems, one company's waste can become another's raw material, thus reducing environmental pollution.</p>
            <p>In the context of Industry 4.0, the layout of eco-industrial parks needs to further integrate smart technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, etc. These technologies can optimize resource allocation within the park, enhance production efficiency, and further reduce environmental impacts. For instance, intelligent logistics systems can ensure fast and efficient transport of materials and products, reducing carbon emissions during inventory and transport. Moreover, parks can use digital twin technology for virtual simulations to model various production and environmental scenarios, predicting and optimizing park operations in advance.</p>

            <h3>Industry 4.0 and Geographic Space Restructuring</h3>
            <p>Industry 4.0 not only changes the way we produce but also restructures the global distribution of industrial activities. Traditionally, industrial activities were concentrated in areas with low labor costs. However, with the advancement of automation technology, the advantage of low labor costs is being replaced by technological and innovation capabilities. High-tech industrial parks are shifting towards knowledge-intensive regions like Silicon Valley or Shenzhen, which not only provide advanced technical support but also possess a rich innovation ecosystem.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Industry 4.0 promotes the concept of "micro-factories," which are small, flexible, and mobile production facilities. These micro-factories can quickly adjust their location and production lines according to market demands, reducing dependency on fixed large-scale production sites. This flexibility makes industrial geography not static but dynamic, adapting to market and technological developments. At the same time, Industry 4.0 fosters regional cooperation and optimizes global supply chains, promoting both localization and globalization of production and consumption.</p>

            <h3>The Role of Multinational Corporations in Global Industrial Geography</h3>
            <p>Multinational corporations play a crucial role in this geographic restructuring. They leverage global resource chains for production layout, optimize supply chain management, minimize costs, and maximize profits. By establishing R&D centers, production bases, and sales networks in different countries and regions, multinational corporations can effectively respond to changes in the global market.</p>
            <p>The involvement of multinational corporations in eco-industrial parks is also significant. They are not just participants but also drivers and innovators. By introducing advanced production technologies and management practices, multinational corporations can elevate the sustainability level of the entire park. Their global influence also brings international perspectives and resources to the park, facilitating seamless integration with global supply chains. For example, multinational corporations can use their global networks to introduce green supply chain management, encouraging park companies to adopt clean production technologies and sustainable practices.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Under the dual push of Industry 4.0 and sustainable development, the spatial layout of eco-industrial parks is undergoing profound transformation. Multinational corporations, as key players in global economic activities, play roles not only in pursuing economic benefits but also in leading and innovating within the global industrial geographic restructuring. In the future, how to balance technological innovation, economic benefits, and environmental protection will be a common challenge for eco-industrial parks and multinational corporations. This trend not only reshapes industrial geography but also provides new pathways for the sustainable development of the global economy, pushing global industry towards smarter, greener, and more sustainable directions.</p>
