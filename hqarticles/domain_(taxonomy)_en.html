            <h2>Introduction: The Concept and Importance of "Domain"</h2>
            <p>When exploring the boundaries and fluidity of "domains," we first need to understand the essence of the concept of "domain." In physics, "domain" typically refers to a spatial region with specific properties, such as electromagnetic fields, gravitational fields, etc. The boundaries of these physical domains are often determined by their scope of action or influence, characterized by clear physical properties. However, with technological advancements, particularly the rapid development of information technology, the concept of "domain" has expanded from physical space to digital space. In digital space, "domains" more often manifest
