            <h3>I. The Dialogue Between the Starry Sky and Human Civilization</h3>
            <h4>1. Constellation Myths: The Origin and Inheritance of Civilization</h4>
            <p>Constellations are not only the basic units of astronomy but also symbols of human civilization. In ancient Greek, Babylonian, Chinese, and other ancient civilizations, constellations were imbued with rich mythological colors, serving as a spiritual bridge for dialogue between humans and the universe. Myths such as Orion and Leo in Greek mythology, the Big Dipper and the story of Cowherd and Weaver Girl in ancient China, are all crystallizations of our ancestors' romantic imagination of the universe. These constellation legends not only record humanity's awe and sentimentality towards nature but also carry their profound philosophical reflections on fate, life, and the cosmos.</p>
            <h4>2. The Scientific Revolution: From Astrology to Modern Astronomy</h4>
            <p>With the rise of the scientific revolution, humanity's understanding of the universe underwent a revolutionary transformation. Copernicus's "Heliocentric Theory" shattered the shackles of the geocentric model, Galileo's telescope observations revealed the true faces of planets, and Newton's law of universal gravitation laid the cornerstone for modern physics. Modern astronomy tells us that constellations are merely virtual projections on the celestial sphere, and the distances between stars far exceed our imagination. However, it is these scientific discoveries that allow us to reexamine constellation culture with a more objective perspective, exploring its profound significance in human civilization.</p>
