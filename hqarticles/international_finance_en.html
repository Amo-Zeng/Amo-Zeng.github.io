            <h2>Digital Currencies, Green Finance, and Emerging Markets: The New Dynamics of the International Financial System</h2>
            <p>In today's global economic environment, the financial system is undergoing unprecedented changes. The interactions among digital currencies, green finance, and emerging markets are not only reshaping the structure and operation of the international financial system but also profoundly affecting global economic interactions. This article will explore how these forces interweave to drive and shape the future landscape of international finance.</p>

            <h3>1. Reshaping the International Financial System with Digital Currencies</h3>
            <p>The **rise of digital currencies** has moved from a conceptual phase to a period of substantial impact. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) like China's Digital Yuan (DCEP), Sweden's e-krona, and stablecoins such as USDT, USDC are restructuring payment systems, monetary policy implementation, and financial inclusion. Particularly, the implementation of CBDCs can simplify cross-border payments, enhance the efficiency and transparency of financial systems. However, this transformation also brings new challenges, including regulatory issues, technical risks, and privacy and security concerns.</p>
            <h4>Future Outlook:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>**Global Cooperation**: Establishing international standards to ensure interoperability and regulatory consistency of digital currencies is crucial.</li>
                <li>**Technological Innovation**: Blockchain and related technologies will further develop to enhance the practicality and security of digital currencies.</li>
                <li>**Financial Education**: Enhancing public understanding and acceptance of digital currencies to promote their widespread use.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Climate Change and the International Impact of Green Finance</h3>
            <p>The impact of **climate change** on the global economy is increasingly significant, fueling the rise of **green finance**. Tools like green bonds, carbon markets, and sustainable investments not only drive domestic policy and regulatory transformation but also have profound effects on the international level. Green finance promotes the global financial market's transition towards sustainability, spurs innovation in clean energy technology, and facilitates economic restructuring.</p>
            <h4>Challenges and Future Outlook:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>**Funding Gap**: Addressing climate change requires more green investment to bridge the funding gap.</li>
                <li>**International Cooperation**: Strengthening the formulation and enforcement of global green finance standards to coordinate green finance policies across countries.</li>
                <li>**Technological Progress**: Developing more efficient energy and financial tools to meet the needs of sustainable development.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>3. Interaction of Emerging Markets with International Financial Markets</h3>
            <p>The **rapid growth of emerging markets** provides rich opportunities for international investors while also posing challenges. Through interaction with international financial markets, emerging markets not only enhance their economic vitality but also promote financial market interconnectivity through mechanisms like the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect. However, issues like political risk, currency fluctuations, and information asymmetry persist.</p>
            <h4>Opportunities and Challenges:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>**High Returns and Diversification**: Emerging markets offer opportunities for high returns and diversification of investment risk.</li>
                <li>**Financial Risk Transmission**: The tight linkage of global financial markets means rapid transmission of risks.</li>
                <li>**Policy Impact**: Policy changes have significant market impacts, necessitating international cooperation and policy coordination.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
