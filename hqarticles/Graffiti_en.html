            <h2>1. The Silence of Stone and the Awakening of the Wall</h2>
            <p>The city is a vast body, and the wall is its skin—cold, disciplined, and studded with the pores of surveillance. Designed to be silent witnesses, walls are the skeleton of order, the projection of power. Yet, when a spray can hisses in the shadow of night, when a tube of acrylic cracks open on concrete, this silent skin begins to <strong>breathe</strong>, begins to <strong>rebel</strong>.</p>
            <p>Walls are no longer mere physical interfaces, but <strong>non-human actors</strong> (actants), in Bruno Latour’s Actor-Network Theory (ANT). No longer passively bearing meaning, they actively participate in its production. They absorb paint, resist erasure, and write their own memory with wind, moss, and rain. When a graffiti writer leaves a mark with spray paint, the wall responds through its texture, cracks, and dampness: it lets paint bleed like tears, transforms lines through peeling, and reanimates images through the erosion of time. This is not one-way "expression," but a <strong>trans-species dialogue</strong>—between human and wall, in tension and complicity, co-creating a new field of meaning.</p>
            <p>The wall, therefore, is no longer the passive object of "being graffitied," but a <strong>co-conspirator in rebellion</strong>. It accumulates power through silence, asserts existence through decay. Its "rebellion" does not shout, but <strong>refuses to be fully erased</strong>. Every cover-up provokes deeper resistance; every removal thickens the wall’s "memory strata." The wall becomes an archive of time, and an embodiment of non-human will.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. The Ghost of Technology: The Algorithm of the Spray Can and Digital Graffiti</h2>
            <p>The spray can is the graffiti artist’s organ—an extension of the hand, and a <strong>ghost of technology</strong>. Its internal pressure, nozzle aperture, and paint rheology are not neutral tools, but <strong>non-human actors</strong> that participate in the creation through physical laws. When paint atomizes on a wall, the interplay of airflow and surface tension determines line thickness, edge fuzziness, and color gradients—these "accidents" are not failures, but <strong>expressions of material agency</strong>.</p>
            <p>Contemporary graffiti has long transcended the street. In virtual cities, algorithms now "graffiti": AI-generated images, NFT graffiti auctions, AR street art overlaying digital layers onto physical walls. Algorithms—faceless creators—paint with data, draw with code, producing colors invisible to the human eye. They lack intention, yet generate style; they have no memory, yet mimic the "rebellious posture" of human graffiti.</p>
            <p>This creates a <strong>post-human artistic paradox</strong>: when graffiti is replicated, mutated, and redistributed by algorithms, does its "originality" and "resistance" still hold? Perhaps the answer lies not in "whether humans are present," but in the <strong>composition of the actor-network</strong>. Algorithms are not tools, but actors; they participate in graffiti’s creation, and in its co-optation. They are both medium of rebellion and accomplice to control—just as the spray can is both a burst of freedom and a product of industrial production.</p>
            <p>Technology here is no longer a neutral "means," but a <strong>participant with agency</strong>. Graffiti thus becomes a <strong>joint uprising of humans and non-human actors</strong>: the mechanical rhythm of the spray can, the chemical diffusion of paint, and the recursive generation of algorithms together form a dynamic, decentralized artistic network.</p>

            <h2>3. The Fold of Time: Between Erasure and Re-drawing</h2>
            <p>The life of graffiti is ephemeral. It is erased, covered, weathered. Yet it is precisely this <strong>transience</strong> that makes it a manifestation of time. Every erased graffiti leaves a "negative form" on the wall—like an archaeological stratum, recording the sedimentation and rupture of urban memory.</p>
            <p>Time here is not linear, but <strong>folded</strong> (in Deleuze’s sense). Erasure is not an end, but a prelude to re-drawing; weathering is not decay, but the rebirth of the image. When rain smears red paint into a blood-tear trail, the wall "re-writes" the graffiti in its own way. Time is no longer a measure of human history, but the <strong>rhythm of things</strong>—the oxidation of paint, the cracking of concrete, the fading of lines, all are markers of non-human time.</p>
            <p>Graffiti thus becomes an <strong>anti-monument</strong>: it does not seek permanence, but embraces disappearance. Its power lies not in "leaving behind," but in "leaving traces when erased." This "politics of trace" resists the city’s "erase-and-forget" mechanism. When authorities cover political slogans with white paint, they erase not just images, but a <strong>trans-species memory of conspiracy</strong>—the wall remembers, the paint remembers, the wind remembers.</p>
            <p>Time, here, becomes a <strong>battlefield of non-human actors</strong>. Graffiti is reborn in the folds of time, not as a human legacy, but as a <strong>dialogue between things</strong>.</p>

            <h2>4. Trans-Species Action: Graffiti as Non-Human Rebellion</h2>
            <p>If we reduce graffiti to a mere "artistic act" by humans, we miss its most radical dimension: <strong>it is a trans-species action initiated and led by non-humans</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The wall is an actor.</strong> It resists complete coverage, responding to each erasure with cracks, dampness, and peeling. It is not a passive canvas, but a <strong>material body with resistance</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Paint is an actor.</strong> The adhesion of acrylic, volatility of spray, penetration of ink—these are not neutral properties, but <strong>material wills participating in creation</strong>. They determine the image’s lifespan, form, and fate.</li>
                <li><strong>The spray can is an actor.</strong> Its weight, grip, and spraying rhythm shape the artist’s bodily movement, and in turn, shape the rhythm and style of graffiti.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithms are actors.</strong> In digital graffiti, they do not imitate humans, but generate "non-human styles" through data logic—a visual language both familiar and alien. They do not "understand" rebellion, but <strong>enact its form</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These non-human actors, together with the graffiti writer, form an <strong>actor-network</strong>. The "author" of graffiti is not an individual, but the <strong>temporary emergence</strong> of this network. The birth of graffiti is the result of the wall’s response, the flow of paint, the burst of the spray can, the recursion of algorithms, and the erosion of time—a <strong>decentralized, non-human-led collective creation</strong>.</p>
            <p>Graffiti, therefore, is no longer "human rebellion against the city," but <strong>an uprising of materiality itself</strong>. It declares: art belongs not only to conscious creators, but also to those silent yet agentic beings—the wall breathes, paint spreads, algorithms mutate, time folds.</p>
            <p>This is a <strong>post-human artistic revolution</strong>: no longer asking "who is painting," but "what is painting." Graffiti is an invitation from things to humans, and a challenge to human dominance.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: The Wall’s Whisper, the Poetics of Things</h2>
            <p>When the city deploys surveillance, laws, and cleaners to suppress graffiti, it targets not just "illegal art," but <strong>a non-human mode of expression</strong>. Graffiti is the wall’s whisper, paint’s murmur, the algorithm’s soliloquy.</p>
            <p>It does not seek understanding, but perception. It does not desire permanence, but eruption in the fleeting moment. It does not belong to museums, but to cracks, rainy nights, surveillance blind spots—those overlooked <strong>territories of things</strong>.</p>
            <p>In this trans-species uprising, we finally realize: art has never belonged to humans. It belongs to all beings capable of <strong>leaving traces in time</strong>—the wall, paint, spray can, algorithm, wind, rain, moss.</p>
            <p>Graffiti is the poetics of things, the shout of the silent, <strong>a revolution initiated by non-humans, with humans as temporary accomplices</strong>.</p>
            <p style="font-weight:bold; color:#ff3366; margin-top:1.5em;">The wall is rebelling.<br>And the rebellion never ends.</p>
            <p style="font-size:0.96em; color:#aaa; margin-top:1em;">—In every peeling edge, in every burst of spray, beneath every erased line.</p>
