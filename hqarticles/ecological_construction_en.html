            <h3>I. The Core of Ecological Restoration: Biodiversity Enhancement Programs</h3>
            <p>Ecosystems are intricate networks where various organisms and their physical environments interact and depend on each other. Biodiversity acts as the "software" of this network, determining the stability, resilience, and functionality of the ecosystem. Without sufficient biodiversity, even the most beautiful landscapes are merely "ecological deserts," incapable of supporting a healthy ecosystem. Therefore, the core of ecological restoration is not just physical reconstruction but also enhancing biodiversity to restore the functionality and stability of the ecosystem.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Species Introduction: Reconstructing Ecological Networks</strong>
                    <p>In degraded ecosystems, key species may have disappeared, causing ecological networks to break down. By introducing native species and rebuilding food chains and webs, the ecological network can be reconnected, restoring the ecosystem's functionality. For example, introducing herbivores can curb overgrowth of plants and prevent biological invasions; introducing pollinators can increase plant reproduction success rates and promote population recovery. In Australia, overhunting led to a sharp decline in wild kangaroo populations, resulting in overgrowth of grasslands and severe ecological imbalance. By reintroducing native herbivores like kangaroos and wombats, grassland overgrowth was successfully curbed, restoring ecological balance.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Habitat Creation: Building a Stage for Biodiversity</strong>
                    <p>Biodiversity requires diverse habitats as a foundation. By creating wetlands, grasslands, forests, and rock formations, various ecosystems can provide suitable living spaces for different organisms. For example, when restoring degraded wetlands, not only water conditions should be restored but also various microhabitats like shallow ponds, deep pools, and meadows should be constructed to meet the needs of different species. In Florida, USA, by restoring wetland hydrological conditions and creating multiple microhabitats, over 200 species of birds and 50 species of fish were attracted, significantly enhancing local biodiversity.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Corridor Construction: Connecting the Ecological Landscape</strong>
                    <p>Habitat fragmentation is one of the main causes of biodiversity loss. By constructing ecological corridors, isolated habitats can be connected, promoting the migration, communication, and genetic flow of species populations and maintaining genetic diversity. For example, in urbanized areas, greenways and river corridors can be built to provide migration corridors for wildlife, mitigating the impact of habitat fragmentation. In Amsterdam, Netherlands, by constructing a 50-kilometer greenway through the city, multiple nature reserves were successfully connected, providing migration corridors for wildlife and greatly enhancing urban biodiversity.</p>

            <h3>II. Urban Green Revolution: From Vertical Gardens to Ecological Walls</h3>
            <p>The acceleration of urbanization brings issues such as population density, loss of green spaces, and environmental pollution. To address these challenges, people are turning their attention to "vertical space" within cities, exploring how to create micro-ecosystems in limited urban areas to inject vitality into cities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vertical Gardens and Ecological Walls: Beauty and Functionality Combined</strong>
                    <p>Vertical gardens and ecological walls serve as key components of urban micro-ecosystems, capable of beautifying urban environments while improving local microclimates, purifying air, and increasing biodiversity. Vertical gardens lean more towards the concept of a "garden," emphasizing aesthetic value, often composed of various plant combinations to create colorful and layered landscapes, primarily used for decorating building facades and balconies. Ecological walls, however, focus more on "ecological" functions, aiming to improve the environment through plant ecological benefits, such as air purification, noise reduction, temperature regulation, and biodiversity enhancement.</p>
                    <p>For example, in Singapore's "Bishan Park," vertical gardens and ecological walls were embedded in building facades and park walls, not only beautifying the urban environment but also significantly improving air quality and enhancing residents' quality of life. Data shows that these vertical gardens and ecological walls can absorb about 50 tons of CO2 annually and release an equivalent amount of oxygen, providing significant ecological benefits to the urban environment.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Challenges and Future Prospects of Urban Micro-Ecosystems</strong>
                    <p>Although vertical gardens and ecological walls offer numerous advantages, their promotion in cities still faces challenges such as technical difficulties, cost issues, and urban planning and management. In the future, with technological advancements, cost reductions, and increased environmental awareness, urban micro-ecosystems will have broader development prospects. We can anticipate more innovative ecological designs, such as integrating intelligent technology to achieve automatic irrigation, fertilization, and monitoring of ecological walls; constructing multi-level, multifunctional urban ecosystems from building facades to city parks; encouraging public participation in green building and balcony gardening, collectively creating a green, low-carbon, and livable urban environment.</p>
