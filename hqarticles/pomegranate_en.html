            <h3>I. The Forbidden Fruit and Original Sin: The Mythological Prototype of the Apple</h3>
            <p>In the Book of Genesis, Eve, tempted by the serpent, takes the forbidden fruit from the Garden of Eden and shares it with Adam, thereby beginning humanity's fall from grace and the start of civilization. Although the Bible does not specify that the fruit was an apple, subsequent artworks and literature have made the apple the iconic representation of the forbidden fruit. From Botticelli's "The Birth of Venus" to Dürer's engravings, from Gothic cathedral stained glass to Renaissance paintings, the image of the apple repeatedly appears in Western art, symbolizing desire, knowledge, and the paradox of choice. It is both a mark of human wisdom and the cost of losing innocence. This duality makes the apple an eternal symbol in human culture, reminding us of the complex relationship between knowledge and morality, reason and desire.</p>

            <h3>II. The Falling Fruit and Enlightenment: The Scientific Symbol of the Apple</h3>
            <p>If the apple in mythology symbolizes humanity's thirst for knowledge, in reality, the apple has become a catalyst for scientific discovery. In 1666, the fall of an apple inspired Newton's thinking on gravity, which not only changed the course of physics but also赋予 the apple new cultural significance: it became a symbol of enlightenment and discovery. In the 20th century, the apple reappeared at a turning point in human civilization. Alan Turing, a pioneer in computer science, chose to bite into an apple laced with cyanide at the end of his life, a gesture that remains a mystery in the scientific community but firmly linked the apple with innovation and groundbreaking thinking. When Steve Jobs founded Apple Inc., he毫不犹豫地 adopted this symbol as the company's logo,赋予 it new meaning for the era.</p>

            <h3>III. The Digital Garden: The Contemporary Reshaping of the Apple</h3>
            <p>In contemporary society, Apple Inc. has redefined the symbol of the "apple" through its products. From the iMac to the iPhone, from the iPad to the Apple Watch, Apple's products are not just technological creations but also bridges for human interaction with the digital world. They form a virtual "digital garden" where users can explore infinite wisdom and possibilities. The design philosophy of Apple Inc.—simplicity, elegance, and user-friendliness—echoes the original meaning of the apple symbol. It is both a container of wisdom and an object of desire; a mark of choice and a symbol of innovation. By touching the "apple" logo on the screen, people enter a digital world constructed by data and algorithms, where the boundaries between tradition and modernity, material and virtual, reality and imagination are redefined.</p>

            <h3>IV. The "Sweet" Beginning of the Orchard: The Profit Game in the Supply Chain</h3>
            <p>However, the story of the apple is not just about the glory of mythology and technology. At the other end of the supply chain, farmers are working hard in the orchards. The starting point of the apple supply chain is often in remote orchards. Here, farmers undertake the most basic production work. They not only face challenges from the natural environment, such as pests, diseases, and weather changes, but also have to deal with the risks of market fluctuations. Despite this, the income of farmers is often disproportionate. The profit distribution in the apple supply chain shows a clear "pyramid" structure: farmers are at the bottom, earning the least profit, while middlemen and retailers occupy the majority of the profits in the supply chain. This unbalanced distribution model makes the livelihood of farmers precarious. Many farmers, in order to increase yields, have to rely on fertilizers and pesticides, which exacerbates soil degradation and environmental pollution.</p>

            <h3>V. The "Land Grabbing" Game of Middlemen</h3>
            <p>In the apple supply chain, middlemen play a crucial role. They connect farmers with the market, undertaking the tasks of apple picking, transportation, and preliminary processing. However, the power of middlemen is also expanding. By controlling multiple links in the supply chain, they can purchase apples at a lower price and sell them to retailers or processing plants at a higher price. This "land grabbing" movement gives middlemen a dominant position in the supply chain, further exacerbating the plight of farmers. In pursuit of maximum profits, many middlemen ignore the quality of apples and sustainable development. During transportation and storage, a large number of apples spoil due to over-ripening or improper handling, causing resource waste and environmental burden.</p>

            <h3>VI. Retailers' "Sweet" Trap</h3>
            <p>When apples enter the retail stage, consumers only see shiny packaging and attractive prices on the shelves. However, behind these seemingly "sweet" traps lies a complex web of interests. Retailers, through brand marketing and channel control, successfully position apples as a "luxury" item, further driving up prices. Consumers enjoy the "sweetness" while paying for the unfairness in the supply chain. The "sweet" trap of retailers is not only reflected in prices but also in product diversity and quality. To meet market demand, many retailers offer various processed products, such as apple juice and apple sauce. However, these processed products often contain large amounts of additives, posing potential threats to consumers' health. Meanwhile, retailers' excessive packaging and waste behavior also impose a heavy burden on the environment.</p>

            <h3>VII. The Nutritional Code and Health Benefits of Apples</h3>
            <p>Despite concerns about the imbalance in the supply chain, apples themselves offer numerous health benefits. From a nutritional perspective, apples are a superfood rich in beneficial components. They are an excellent source of vitamin C, dietary fiber, and potassium, and also contain large amounts of polyphenols, such as quercetin and catechin, which have powerful antioxidant properties. Antioxidants help the body清除 free radicals, slowing cell aging and reducing the risk of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Recent studies have shown that consuming apples is closely related to various health benefits. For example, eating an apple daily can effectively lower cholesterol levels, thereby reducing the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Additionally, the dietary fiber in apples helps regulate blood sugar levels, which is particularly important for diabetics. More remarkably, certain components in apples have been found to have anti-inflammatory and anticancer potential, providing a broad research space for the development of functional foods and supplements in the future.</p>

            <h3>VIII. Apple Peel Extracts: The Innovation Path of Environmental Materials</h3>
            <p>In the field of technology, the potential of apples is equally impressive. Apple peels, as a natural waste, have recently been discovered by scientists to have significant development value. Apple peels contain abundant polyphenols, which not only have antioxidant functions but can also be used to develop new eco-friendly materials. By extracting and purifying polyphenols from apple peels, researchers have successfully prepared a biodegradable plastic alternative. This material is not only environmentally friendly but can also decompose naturally under specific conditions, thereby reducing plastic pollution. Even more exciting is that apple peel extracts can be used to develop antibacterial materials. Studies have shown that certain components in apple peels have significant antibacterial activity, effectively inhibiting the growth of various pathogenic microorganisms. This means that in the future, we may see more antibacterial products based on apple peels, such as food packaging materials, medical instrument surface coatings, etc., which will provide new safeguards for public health and food safety.</p>
