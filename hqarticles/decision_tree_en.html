The term "数甲" (shù jiǎ) typically refers to a classification or designation for mathematics subjects in certain educational systems. For example:  

1. **Taiwan, China**: In Taiwan's high school education, mathematics courses are divided into "数甲" (Advanced Mathematics) and "数乙" (Basic Mathematics).  
   - **数甲 (Advanced Mathematics)**: Designed for students in science and engineering tracks, it covers more advanced and extensive content, including calculus, linear algebra, and other higher-level mathematical topics.  
   - **数乙 (Basic Mathematics)**: Geared toward students in liberal arts or business tracks, it focuses on foundational topics such as statistics, probability, and applied mathematics.  

2. **Mainland China**: In Mainland China, mathematics is not typically categorized as "数甲" or "数乙." Instead, it is structured into different levels based on educational stages (e.g., middle school, high school, university). For example:  
   - In high school, mathematics is divided into compulsory and elective courses, with elective content tailored to students' interests and future academic or career paths.
