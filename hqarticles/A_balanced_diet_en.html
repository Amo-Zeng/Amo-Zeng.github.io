            <h2>Prologue: The Symphony of Seasonality and Personalization</h2>
            <p>In the fast-paced modern society, we often overlook the deep connections between food and nature, and the body and environment. The food on supermarket shelves remains the same throughout the year, but our bodies and nature always follow the rhythm of the seasons. Ancient wisdom tells us that following the seasons is the key to truly nourishing the body and mind; modern science reveals that every individual's dietary needs are unique. A balanced diet is not only a healthy choice but also a wisdom of living in harmony with nature.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>1. The Genetic Code: Unlocking Your Nutritional Needs</h3>
                <p>Each person's genes determine their ability to absorb and metabolize nutrients. For example, some people, due to genetic defects, cannot effectively break down lactose and should avoid or reduce dairy intake, opting for soy products or dark green vegetables instead.</p>
                <p><strong>Personalized Insight:</strong> Understanding your genes allows for better "prescription eating." Through genetic testing, precise dietary plans can be tailored, avoiding盲目 following popular recipes.</p>

                <h3>2. Gut Microbiota: Your "Second Brain" Speaks</h3>
                <p>The gut microbiota determines our tolerance to food. For example, some people may respond well to high-fiber foods, while others may feel bloated. By analyzing the gut microbiota, we can identify which foods promote the growth of beneficial bacteria and which may cause discomfort.</p>
                <p><strong>Personalized Insight:</strong> Pay attention to your gut health and choose diets that can coexist harmoniously with "friendly bacteria." Probiotics, dietary fiber, and fermented foods may be indispensable parts of your "private custom" menu.</p>

                <h3>3. Lifestyle: Dynamic Adjustment, Letting Diet Serve You</h3>
                <p>A balanced diet is not a static formula. Our lifestyle, such as exercise intensity, work pressure, sleep quality, and even emotional state, affects our nutritional needs. For example, after high-intensity exercise, the body needs more protein to repair muscles; under high pressure, it may need foods rich in B vitamins to help the nervous system regain balance.</p>
                <p><strong>Personalized Insight:</strong> Combine diet with your life rhythm and dynamically adjust your nutrient intake. When life changes, your dietary strategy should also respond flexibly.</p>

                <h3>4. Emotion and Diet: A Subtle "Psychological Game"</h3>
                <p>There is a complex interaction between emotion and diet. For example, some people choose carbohydrates to alleviate anxiety, while others may have no interest in sweets.</p>
                <p><strong>Personalized Insight:</strong> Understand the emotional connection between you and food, avoiding the trap of "emotional eating." Choose foods beneficial to your mood rather than letting your emotions control your diet.</p>
