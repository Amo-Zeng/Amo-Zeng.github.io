            <h2>Depth of Discharge: The Core Parameter of Battery Management and the Bridge to Sustainability</h2>
            <p>In modern energy systems, batteries serve as critical energy storage components, and their performance and lifespan directly impact the system's economic efficiency and are central to achieving environmental sustainability. Depth of Discharge (DoD) is a core parameter in battery management, not only influencing battery lifespan and performance but also serving as a pivotal bridge connecting technological development with a sustainable future through its profound impact on the economic benefits and environmental implications of energy storage systems. This article will explore the complexity of DoD and its optimization strategies from three dimensions: battery lifespan, economic benefits, and environmental protection, revealing its strategic significance in battery management and technological advancement.</p>

            <h3>I. The Non-Linear Relationship Between Depth of Discharge and Battery Lifespan: Unlocking Lifespan Optimization Potential</h3>
            <p>There has long been a common misconception regarding the relationship between Depth of Discharge and battery lifespan: that a shallower DoD leads to a longer battery life. This simplistic linear thinking overlooks the non-linear relationship between DoD and the complex chemical reactions inside the battery, limiting the potential for optimizing battery lifespan.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Depth of Discharge, as a core parameter in battery management, is closely related to battery lifespan and serves as a crucial bridge to sustainability through its profound impact on the economic benefits and environmental implications of energy storage systems. By deeply studying the non-linear relationship between DoD and battery lifespan, exploring strategies for dynamically adjusting DoD, and integrating life cycle analysis, we can optimize battery management, extend battery lifespan, reduce operating costs, mitigate environmental burdens, and promote the green development of battery technologies. In the future, with the continuous advancement of battery technology and the strengthening of environmental awareness, optimizing DoD to achieve sustainable energy management will become an important pathway in driving global energy transformation.</p>
