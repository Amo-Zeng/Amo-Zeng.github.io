            <h2>Innovative Transformation of Fiscal Policy</h2>
            <p>Against the backdrop of global climate change, technological revolution, and increasingly complex social issues, fiscal policy, as the core tool of national macroeconomic regulation, is undergoing unprecedented innovative transformation. This article delves into the integration of ecological fiscal policy, digital fiscal policy, and social innovation fiscal policy, analyzing their significant roles in building a green economy, driving governance model transformation, and promoting social progress, and proposes corresponding policy recommendations.</p>

            <h3>I. Ecological Fiscal Policy and the Construction of a Green Economy</h3>
            <p>Ecological fiscal policy influences the behavior of economic entities through fiscal instruments such as taxes, subsidies, and government investments to achieve environmental protection and sustainable development goals. The design of such policies needs to clearly target reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy efficiency, and supporting the development of renewable energy, guiding capital flow toward green sectors through tools like carbon taxes and green funds. International experiences, such as the EU Emissions Trading System and Norway's carbon tax practice, demonstrate that ecological fiscal policy can effectively promote environmental protection and a smooth economic transition.</p>

            <h3>II. Digital Fiscal Policy and a New Paradigm of Governance</h3>
            <p>Digital fiscal policy leverages technologies such as big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence to optimize the allocation of fiscal resources, enhance transparency, and improve efficiency. This includes the digitalization of fiscal information systems, the intelligence of decision-support systems, the networking of public service delivery, and the precision of fiscal regulation. Despite challenges such as technical barriers, data security, institutional obstacles, and issues of fairness and inclusiveness, digital fiscal policy will reshape fiscal management processes and mechanisms, improving governance transparency, democratic decision-making, innovative service delivery, and risk control capabilities.</p>

            <h3>III. Social Innovation Fiscal Policy and Inclusive Growth</h3>
            <p>Social innovation fiscal policy incentivizes social forces to participate in innovation activities and address social issues through tax incentives, fiscal subsidies, and government procurement. Its core goal is to promote social innovation, optimize resource allocation, and build an inclusive growth framework. Implementation mechanisms involve tax incentives, fiscal subsidies, government procurement, and innovation funds. Facing challenges such as policy design complexity, fund allocation efficiency, regulation and evaluation, and the innovation ecosystem, it is necessary to refine policy design, strengthen fund management, improve the regulatory system, and nurture the innovation ecosystem.</p>
