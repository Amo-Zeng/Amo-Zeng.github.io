            <h2>I. The Cage of the Gaze: The Body Inscribed by Power</h2>
            <p>Between the spotlight and the gaze, the model's body has never been merely "something to be displayed." It is the most precise medium for power's inscription, the perfect testing ground for disciplinary technologies. Foucault's panopticon prison, as depicted in *Discipline and Punish*, finds its real-world mirror on the runway and in front of the camera—the model's body becomes a micro-theater of power in operation.</p>
            <p>Every turn, every breath, is absorbed into standardized aesthetic procedures. From child model training camps to international runways, the body is decomposed into measurable, controllable technical units: shoulder width, waist circumference, stride length, facial expression curvature. This is not mere commodification, but a deep colonization of the body by power—transforming the potential for resistance into performance technique.</p>
            <p>The rise of <strong>Adut Akech</strong> is akin to a silent breakout. The South Sudanese-born supermodel doesn't merely present exotic charm before the lens, but enacts a subtle rebellion against Western aesthetic hegemony. Her very existence deconstructs the singular standard of "perfect physique." When she graced the cover of *Vogue* with her angular facial lines and unique skin tone, she was in fact carving a crack through the very tissue of power.</p>

            <h2>II. The Paradox of Healing: From Discipline to Self-Discipline</h2>
            <p>The theory of somatic therapy reveals a more paradoxical reality: when the body is disciplined to the extreme, it paradoxically acquires a therapeutic self-awareness. This is not passive healing, but a reconstruction of subjectivity achieved through extreme self-mastery.</p>
            <p><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong>'s career trajectory perfectly embodies this paradox. From reality TV star to top supermodel, her transformation is not only a physical reinvention, but an internal reconstruction of subjectivity. Through countless photo shoots, runway walks, and dietary regimens, her body has become the language through which she communicates with the world. Though this self-discipline originates in external pressure, it evolves into a practice of self-empowerment.</p>
            <p>Reki Kawahara's virtual body theory in *Sword Art Online* offers a new dimension for understanding this phenomenon. When the body can be digitally reconstructed, real-world body discipline takes on a quasi-"coded" character—each self-adjustment becomes akin to writing a line of code about the self. The model's body thus becomes a liminal space where reality and virtuality converge.</p>

            <h2>III. The Dialectics of Objectification: From Object to Subject</h2>
            <p>Objectification theory often reduces the model's body to a mere victim of commodity logic, yet this view overlooks the body's inherent potential for resistance. When the body is fully objectified, it paradoxically gains the possibility of redefining itself.</p>
            <p>This dialectic is especially evident in contemporary modeling practices. Models are no longer passive display tools, but active constructors of meaning. Every presentation is an act of redefinition—redefining beauty, redefining the body, redefining the relationship between self and world.</p>
            <p>Adut Akech's body language embodies this dialectic. In every gesture, she seems to say: <em>I acknowledge being watched, but I am also watching you.</em> This two-way gaze breaks the unidirectional logic of traditional objectification theory. The body is both the objectified and the one who objectifies others—simultaneously object and subject.</p>

            <h2>IV. Body Politics in the Digital Age</h2>
            <p>As AI-generated models begin to dominate virtual spaces, and algorithmic aesthetics on social media emerge as new mechanisms of power, body politics has entered an entirely new phase. This is not a rejection of tradition, but an evolution in how power operates.</p>
            <p>The perfect proportions and flawless features of AI models do not eliminate body anxiety—they intensify it. They create an unattainable standard, further marginalizing real bodies. This "perfect" violence is more insidious and effective than traditional objectification.</p>
            <p>The "neural link" era foreseen by Reki Kawahara in *Accel World* is being partially realized today through social media. Everyone reshapes their self-image via filters and algorithms—self-objectification has become a fundamental feature of contemporary life.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Liberation</h2>
            <p>True liberation does not lie in escaping the body, but in reclaiming the right to speak about it. The uprising of the body truly begins when models start defining beauty on their own terms, telling their own stories, when they shift from being the watched to the watchers, from object to subject.</p>
            <p>This uprising is not violent rebellion, but poetic reconstruction. It demands that we rethink the relationships between body and power, body and technology, body and self. In the body politics of the digital age, each of us must become the curator of our own body—navigating our own balance between discipline and freedom, objectification and liberation.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Liberation is not an end, but a beginning—an eternal proposition about how the body can reclaim its subjectivity.</p>
