            <p>In an era of information overload, efficiently processing and integrating information has become a focal point for various fields of study.

            <h3>I. Cognitive Science Perspective: Information Processing and Memory</h3>
            <h4>1. Incremental Aggregation and Human Brain Information Processing</h4>
            <p>The human brain processes information through a series of complex steps including perception, attention, encoding, storage, and retrieval. Incremental aggregation plays a key role in these steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Perception and Attention:</strong> The brain receives information incrementally, reducing the overconsumption of attentional resources, making the learning process more sustainable.</li>
                <li><strong>Encoding and Integration:</strong> Incremental aggregation allows the brain to process a limited amount of information at each step, avoiding information overload and promoting better encoding and integration.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage and Memory:</strong> Through repetition and incremental enhancement, each piece of information is better consolidated, forming stable memory networks.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Optimizing the Learning Process</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reducing Cognitive Load:</strong> By breaking down learning tasks into small steps, learners process less information at once, avoiding fatigue.</li>
                <li><strong>Improving Memory Efficiency:</strong> The repeated exposure and incremental enhancement of information increase the durability of memory.</li>
                <li><strong>Building Knowledge Structures:</strong> Incremental aggregation helps in constructing complex knowledge networks, allowing learners to gain a deeper understanding of the material.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Relationship with Memory Models</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Working Memory and Long-term Memory:</strong> Incremental aggregation aids in transferring information from working memory to long-term memory, reducing forgetfulness.</li>
                <li><strong>Spaced Repetition Effect:</strong> Intervals in learning help consolidate memory, a principle reflected in incremental aggregation.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep Processing Theory:</strong> Incremental understanding and integration of information promote deep processing and comprehension.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>4. Applications and Practices</h4>
            <p>In education, incremental aggregation can be applied in course design, review strategies, and the development of learning tools. By gradually introducing new knowledge and reinforcing old knowledge, it effectively enhances student learning efficiency and memory retention.</p>
