            <h2>Multi-perspective Analysis of Euclid's Algorithm</h2>
            <p>This article delves into Euclid's Algorithm through the lenses of Dynamic Programming, Group Theory, and Graph Theory, providing a multi-faceted understanding and analysis. Below is a summary of the main content and perspectives presented in the article:</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Dynamic Programming Perspective</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Subproblem Definition</strong>: Euclid's Algorithm recursively breaks down subproblems, solving the GCD of \(b\) and \(a \mod b\) each time.</li>
                <li><strong>State Transition Equation</strong>: \(\text{dp}[a, b] = \text{dp}[b, a \mod b]\), with the termination condition being \(\text{dp}[a, 0] = a\).</li>
                <li><strong>Space Optimization</strong>: By using an iterative approach, the space complexity can be optimized from \(O(\log \min(a, b))\) to \(O(1)\).</li>
                <li><strong>Extended Applications</strong>: The Dynamic Programming perspective can inspire the design of the Extended Euclid's Algorithm.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Group Theory Perspective</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Binary Operation</strong>: The core of Euclid's Algorithm is the modulus operation, reflecting the structure of the integer group \((\mathbb{Z}, +)\).</li>
                <li><strong>Simplification Process</strong>: Each modulus operation reduces the problem size until \(b = 0\).</li>
                <li><strong>Generalization</strong>: Euclid's Algorithm can be generalized to other algebraic structures such as polynomial rings.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Graph Theory Perspective</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Directed Graph Representation</strong>: The algorithm states \((a, b)\) are represented as graph nodes, with directed edges indicating \((a, b) \rightarrow (b, a \mod b)\).</li>
                <li><strong>Path Analysis</strong>: Each path corresponds to a method of solving the GCD, with the path length correlating to the number of iterations.</li>
                <li><strong>Shortest Path and Optimality</strong>: The optimality of Euclid's Algorithm can be viewed as finding the shortest path in the graph, with the worst-case iteration count being proportional to the logarithm of the input numbers.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Through the integration of multiple perspectives, Dynamic Programming, Group Theory, and Graph Theory offer comprehensive methods for understanding Euclid's Algorithm. The Graph Theory perspective reveals the optimality and efficiency of the algorithm, providing a theoretical foundation for algorithm optimization. In the future, this multi-perspective analysis method can be applied to the design and optimization of other algorithms.</p>
