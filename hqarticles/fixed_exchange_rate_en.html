            <h2>Multidimensional Challenges and Future Paths of Fixed Exchange Rate Systems: The Intersection of Climate Change, Digital Currency, and Global Supply Chains</h2>
            <p>As a core pillar of the traditional financial system, the fixed exchange rate system has provided a solid guarantee for the stable growth of the global economy and the smooth operation of international trade. However, with the intensification of climate change, the rise of digital currency, and the vulnerability of the global supply chain becoming apparent, this system has exposed many limitations in addressing the complex challenges of the new era. This article will analyze the challenges and opportunities of the fixed exchange rate system from the perspectives of climate change, digital currency, and global supply chains, and explore its future reform directions.</p>

            <h3>1. Fixed Exchange Rates and Climate Change: Resource Allocation Dilemmas in Green Transition</h3>
            <p>Climate change has become a significant global crisis, and the limitations of the fixed exchange rate system in this area are particularly prominent. Firstly, fixed exchange rates may lead to resource allocation imbalances, causing some countries to over-rely on high-carbon industries. Due to the restrictions of fixed exchange rates, countries lack the ability to adjust their exchange rates to alleviate external shocks, which makes high-carbon industries, with their stable employment and economic growth effects, the "economic pillars" of the country. However, this also hinders the transition to a low-carbon economy. Secondly, the fixed exchange rate system weakens the ability of countries to conduct structural reforms, especially in the investment in green infrastructure and renewable energy. Under fixed exchange rates, countries are often forced to adopt tight fiscal or monetary policies to maintain exchange rate stability, thereby reducing their policy space to address climate change.</p>
            <p>However, the interaction between fixed exchange rates and climate change is not entirely negative. By introducing flexible exchange rate mechanisms, countries can enhance their ability to respond to external shocks and promote the development of low-carbon industries through currency depreciation. For example, emerging market countries can enhance the international competitiveness of their low-carbon technology products by moderately depreciating their currencies. In addition, the international community should actively promote the establishment of green financial mechanisms to support developing countries in low-carbon transition. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank can set up special green funds to provide low-interest loans and technical assistance to developing countries, helping them accelerate their green transition. These measures will help the fixed exchange rate system play a more positive role in addressing climate change.</p>

            <h3>2. Fixed Exchange Rates and Digital Currency: Digital Transformation of the Traditional Financial System</h3>
            <p>The rise of digital currency, especially the development of加密货币 and central bank digital currency (CBDC), is profoundly reshaping the global financial system and presenting new challenges to the fixed exchange rate system. Firstly, the decentralized nature of digital currencies weakens the control of central banks over the foreign exchange market. For example, the cross-border liquidity of加密货币 such as Bitcoin bypasses the traditional foreign exchange market and the regulatory framework of central banks, leading to higher intervention costs for central banks in maintaining fixed exchange rates. Secondly, the high price volatility of digital currencies exacerbates exchange rate instability, further challenging the implementation of the fixed exchange rate system.</p>
            <p>However, digital currencies also provide new technological tools for the reform of the fixed exchange rate system. Through central bank digital currency, central banks can establish more transparent and efficient exchange rate anchoring mechanisms. For example, central banks can automatically execute exchange rate conversion operations through smart contracts, reducing the frequency and cost of market intervention. In addition, digital currency technology can enhance the regulatory capacity of cross-border payments. Central banks can maintain effective control over cross-border capital flows by embedding exchange rate control and capital flow monitoring functions.</p>
            <p>In the future, the fixed exchange rate system may gain new vitality through digital transformation. For example, the "digital anchoring" mechanism may become a new form of the fixed exchange rate system. Central banks of various countries can achieve an automated exchange rate stabilization mechanism through smart contracts between digital currencies and anchoring currencies. At the same time, the development of global stablecoins may also partially replace the function of traditional fixed exchange rates, providing a more stable price reference for cross-border transactions.</p>

            <h3>3. Fixed Exchange Rates and Global Supply Chains: Economic Resilience in the Post-Pandemic Era</h3>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of the global supply chain, and the fixed exchange rate system has also shown its limitations in this context. Firstly, the fixed exchange rate system limits the policy flexibility of countries in dealing with supply chain disruptions. For example, due to the limited independence of monetary policy under fixed exchange rates, central banks cannot use currency depreciation or interest rate cuts to alleviate economic pressure. Secondly, the fixed exchange rate system may hinder supply chain diversification. Enterprises tend to choose suppliers within the dollar zone to avoid exchange rate risks, leading to the centralization rather than diversification of the supply chain.</p>
            <p>However, the pandemic also provides an opportunity for the reform of the fixed exchange rate system. By exploring a more flexible hybrid exchange rate system, countries can retain the stability of fixed exchange rates while giving monetary policy greater flexibility. For example, a country can allow its currency to float within a certain range, retaining the stability of fixed exchange rates while giving monetary policy some flexibility. This system may be more effective in dealing with supply chain disruptions, as it can alleviate economic pressure through exchange rate adjustments while avoiding the uncertainty caused by excessive exchange rate volatility.</p>
            <p>In addition, international cooperation is crucial in building resilience in the global supply chain. By promoting regional supply chain cooperation to reduce dependence on a single country or region; by using digital technology to improve the transparency and responsiveness of the supply chain; and by establishing a joint mechanism for dealing with supply chain disruptions through international cooperation, countries can build a more resilient economic system in the post-pandemic era.</p>

            <h3>4. Future Reform Directions of the Fixed Exchange Rate System</h3>
            <p>Facing the multiple challenges of climate change, digital currency, and global supply chains, the fixed exchange rate system needs to undergo systemic reform. Firstly, the international community should promote flexible exchange rate mechanisms, allowing countries to have greater policy space in responding to external shocks. For example, introducing an "interval fixed exchange rate" system, allowing currencies to float within a certain range, to balance exchange rate stability and policy flexibility. Secondly, establishing international green financial mechanisms and regional digital currency alliances to support developing countries in low-carbon transition and enhance the coordination of exchange rate policies. Thirdly, strengthening the diversification and technological innovation of the global supply chain to reduce dependence on a single country or region and improve the transparency and responsiveness of the supply chain.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The multidimensional impact of the fixed exchange rate system on the global economy shows that this traditional financial tool faces new difficulties but also contains opportunities for reform in addressing the challenges of the new era. By introducing flexible exchange rate mechanisms, establishing international green financial mechanisms, promoting the innovative application of digital currency technology, and strengthening global supply chain cooperation, the international community can inject new vitality into the fixed exchange rate system, promoting green transition, sustainable development, and resilience enhancement of the global economy. Only in this way can we achieve long-term global economic prosperity and fair resource allocation in the face of climate change, digital currency, and global supply chain vulnerability.</p>
