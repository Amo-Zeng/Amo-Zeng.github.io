            <p><em>"Technology is never neutral; it always carries social, political, and ethical weight." — Adapted from Langdon Winner, 1980</em></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>In the current era of deep integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies into societal operations, data science has evolved from an analytical tool into a <strong>critical social infrastructure</strong>, influencing knowledge production, public memory, and environmental governance. Yet, its growing power is not matched by corresponding ethical consciousness. This article proposes an integrated analytical framework—the "<strong>Cognitive-Cultural-Ecological</strong>" triple critique (Cognitive-Cultural-Ecological Critique, CCEC)—to systematically reveal how data science exercises invisible power across three dimensions: <strong>epistemic justice, collective memory construction, and ecological sustainability</strong>, while reproducing structural inequalities. This framework not only challenges the myth of "technological neutrality" (see Latour, 2005; Haraway, 2016), but also points toward an interdisciplinary practice of <strong>Responsible Data Science</strong> (RDS), emphasizing that technology must be embedded within shared social values and ecological ethics.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>I. Epistemic Colonization: Structural Deprivation in Knowledge Production</h3>
            <p>The Global South is becoming a "data colony" for AI training: regions such as Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America contribute vast amounts of linguistic, visual, and behavioral data, yet control over model development, deployment, and profit distribution remains highly concentrated in Western tech giants. African languages account for only 0.5% of global natural language processing (NLP) corpora (Bender et al., 2021), yet they underpin performance optimization in mainstream multilingual models, leading to frequent <strong>semantic drift</strong> and <strong>cultural misrecognition</strong> in local contexts.</p>

            <p>We propose a <strong>Cognitive Justice Index</strong> (CJI) to quantify four dimensions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Sovereignty</strong> (local control over data)</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge Participation</strong> (representation of local experts in model design)</li>
                <li><strong>Contextual Preservation</strong> (whether social contexts of data collection are documented)</li>
                <li><strong>Technology Reversion</strong> (ability of local communities to reuse models)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The CJI reveals that current data science practices amount to <strong>epistemic colonization</strong>—a process through which data extraction and knowledge monopolization integrate marginalized experiences into centralized cognitive frameworks. When AI equates "development" with "Westernization" or attributes "poverty" to individual behavior, it algorithmically reproduces <strong>cultural violence</strong> (Galtung, 1990).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>II. Cultural Sculpting: Generative AI as the Politics of Memory</h3>
            <p>Generative AI is not merely an information processor but a <strong>sculptor of collective memory</strong>. Large language models reconstruct historical narratives probabilistically, often flattening, decontextualizing, or even reshaping reality. Research shows that GPT-style models, when answering questions about "colonial history," tend to downplay violence and emphasize "civilizing missions," reflecting an overrepresentation of Western textbooks, mainstream media, and colonial archives in training data (see Noble, 2018).</p>

            <p>To address this, we propose a <strong>Memory Provenance</strong> (MP) framework, requiring model outputs to be bound to three layers of metadata:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Provenance</strong> (source documents, collection context, identity of data collectors)</li>
                <li><strong>Reasoning Transparency</strong> (evidence chain, confidence level, uncertainty)</li>
                <li><strong>Narrative Deviation</strong> (degree of deviation from mainstream academic consensus)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>MP is not just a technical design but a <strong>minimum threshold of cultural democracy</strong>—only with traceability can memory escape algorithmic monopolization, and history remain open to questioning and reconfiguration.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>III. Ecological Debt: The Externalized Costs of Computing Power</h3>
            <p>The environmental costs of AI training have long been systematically ignored. Training a single large language model can emit up to 1,260 tons of CO₂—equivalent to the lifetime emissions of 300 gasoline-powered vehicles (Strubell et al., 2019). Crucially, these costs are <strong>highly spatially uneven</strong>: data centers are concentrated in regions with cheap energy but ecologically fragile environments (e.g., Iceland, Inner Mongolia, China), while pollution, water consumption, and electronic waste are ultimately borne by the Global South.</p>

            <p>We develop an <strong>Ecological Debt Assessment Model</strong> (EDAM), incorporating:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Carbon Debt Index</strong> (CDI)</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Justice Weight</strong> (EJW)</li>
                <li><strong>Composite Debt Value</strong> (EDV)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>EDAM reveals that every $1 invested in AI R&D generates an average of $0.78 in ecological debt, 83% of which is "invisibly paid" by low-income nations—constituting a form of <strong>green colonialism</strong>, where technological gains accrue to the Global North while environmental costs fall on marginalized communities (see Moore, 2015).</p>

            <h3>IV. Deep Interconnection of the Triple Critique: The Triple Alienation of Technological Power</h3>
            <p>These three dimensions are not isolated phenomena but <strong>interlocking manifestations of technological power alienation</strong>, interconnected through:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Structural Homology</strong>: All exhibit a "center-periphery" power structure—the West/urban/capital controls data, models, and energy, while the South/rural/communities are extracted, represented, and polluted;</li>
                <li><strong>Temporal Layering</strong>: Epistemic colonization is <strong>spatial oppression</strong>, cultural sculpting is <strong>historical reconstruction</strong>, and ecological debt is <strong>intergenerational overdraft</strong>, together forming a "temporal-spatial colonization";</li>
                <li><strong>Ontological Critique</strong>: Data is not "raw fact" but <strong>encoded social relations</strong>; models are not "objective tools" but <strong>embodiments of power structures</strong>; training processes are not "technologically neutral" but <strong>redistributions of resources and discourse</strong> (see Bowker & Star, 1999).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Thus, data science is fundamentally a <strong>triple alienation practice</strong>: alienating knowledge (cognitive), memory (cultural), and nature (ecological).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>V. Responsible Data Science: A Pathway for Interdisciplinary Governance</h3>
            <p>To respond to the triple critique, we propose a <strong>Responsible Data Science</strong> (RDS) framework with four pillars:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Epistemic Justice Framework</strong>: Promote a <strong>Global Data Contributor Rights Protocol</strong> to ensure data providers have equity and voice in model benefits; implement <strong>CJI certification</strong> as a mandatory metric for AI project ethics audits.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Provenance Engineering</strong>: Develop "<strong>Provenance Chains</strong>" technology to bind model outputs to original data and collection contexts; establish "<strong>Narrative Audit Committees</strong>" composed of historians, community representatives, and AI experts to review high-risk generative content.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Debt Transparency</strong>: Mandate AI projects to publish <strong>EDAM reports</strong>, quantifying carbon emissions, water use, and e-waste, and integrate them into Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA); advocate for a "<strong>Green Computing Tax</strong>" on high-debt models, with revenues funding ecological compensation.</li>
                <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Governance Platform</strong>: Establish "<strong>Data Science Social Impact Committees</strong>" to conduct pre-deployment ethical reviews of major AI projects; develop a "<strong>Triple Impact Assessment Toolkit</strong>" (CCEIT) for developers and third-party auditors.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Future Research Directions</h3>
            <p>To deepen the CCEC framework, the following questions require empirical exploration:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Empirical Validation of CJI</strong>: Measure the correlation between CJI and model performance, user trust, and local community acceptance in cross-border AI projects to test whether "epistemic justice enhances technical efficacy";</li>
                <li><strong>Public Acceptance of MP</strong>: Use experimental designs (e.g., A/B testing) to evaluate how different provenance interfaces (e.g., metadata pop-ups, provenance graphs) affect historical narrative credibility and critical thinking;</li>
                <li><strong>Policy Effects of EDAM</strong>: Build system dynamics models to simulate the long-term impacts of a "Green Computing Tax" on data center siting, renewable energy investment, and global carbon emissions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion: From Technological Colonialism to Technological Co-Governance</h3>
            <p>The future of data science should not be defined by more "intelligence," but by more "co-governance." When technology becomes infrastructure, its ethical responsibilities must become central to the social contract. Only by internalizing the "Cognitive-Cultural-Ecological" triple critique as the <strong>ethical genome</strong> of data science can we prevent technology from becoming a new tool of colonization, and instead ensure it truly serves <strong>human collective well-being</strong> and the <strong>Earth's community of life</strong> (see Latour, 2017).</p>
