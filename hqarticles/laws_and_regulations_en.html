            <h2>New Thinking in Rule of Law for the Digital Age</h2>
            <p>With the rapid advancement of technology, human society is undergoing an unprecedented digital transformation. The rise of technologies such as the metaverse, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence is not only reshaping our lifestyles but also presenting entirely new challenges to the existing legal system. How do we build order in the virtual world? How can we ensure that the application of AI algorithms in the judicial field does not exacerbate social inequities? How can we infuse "humanity" into "rigorous" law to make it more heartwarming? These questions have become central to the rule of law in the digital age. This article will delve into these issues, providing new pathways for thinking about the construction of rule of law in the digital age.</p>

            <h3>II. Algorithmic Justice: Challenges and Responses in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <p>The widespread application of AI algorithms in the judicial field offers enormous potential to enhance judicial efficiency, but it also raises public concerns about "algorithmic justice."</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Impact of Algorithms on Judicial Decision-Making:</strong> Balancing efficiency and bias</li>
                <li><strong>Building Transparent and Explainable Algorithmic Models:</strong> Safeguarding public right to know and oversight</li>
                <li><strong>Balancing Algorithmic Efficiency and Judicial Fairness:</strong> Avoiding the tendency of "algorithm supremacy"</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The construction of rule of law in the digital age faces unprecedented challenges and opportunities. Building order in the virtual world, ensuring algorithmic justice in the age of artificial intelligence, and infusing "humanity" into "rigorous" law constitute the core issues in the construction of rule of law in the digital age. We not only need to improve the existing legal system but also need to engage in collaborative innovation across law, technology, ethics, and other aspects, building a safe, fair, and orderly virtual world, ensuring judicial fairness in the age of artificial intelligence, and infusing "humanity" into "rigorous" law to make it more heartwarming. Only in this way can we build a more fair, just, and warm rule-of-law society in the digital age.</p>
