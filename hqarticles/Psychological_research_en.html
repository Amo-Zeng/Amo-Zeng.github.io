            <h2>Introduction: From "Empathizing with Others" to "Relying on Algorithms to Understand Others"</h2>
            <p>In an era where artificial intelligence deeply intervenes in human social activities, we are facing a structural transformation of mentalization ability. Mentalization—the core ability to understand one's own and others' psychological states—is gradually shifting from traditional interpersonal interaction processes to <strong>cognitive practices of human-machine collaboration</strong>. With the widespread application of affective computing systems, social robots, and emotion recognition algorithms, people are increasingly relying on external intelligent systems to complete tasks of emotional interpretation and psychological inference that originally belonged to human instinct. This transformation not only triggers the phenomenon of "Mentalization Offloading" but also, at a deeper level, may lead to the reconfiguration or even degradation of human empathy ability, known as "Empathic Alienation". This article aims to systematically elaborate the potential impact of long-term human-machine interaction on human mentalization ability from the multidimensional perspectives of psychology, cognitive science, and philosophy of technology, and attempts to reveal the underlying cognitive neural mechanisms and social implications.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Theoretical Background: The Dual Crisis of Mentalization and Cognitive Restructuring</h2>
            <p>Mentalization ability has long been considered the cornerstone of human social existence, with its neural basis mainly distributed in the Default Mode Network (DMN), prefrontal-limbic system pathways, and temporoparietal junction areas of the social brain network. However, the rise of artificial intelligence, especially affective AI, is posing a dual challenge to this ability:</p>
            
            <p>On one hand, the <strong>cognitive offloading effect</strong> brought by intelligent technology is gradually emerging. When algorithms can quickly and "accurately" provide others' emotional states, intention inferences, and even behavior predictions, an individual's motivation and effort to actively engage in psychological inference may significantly decrease. According to the principle of neuroplasticity, long-term reduced investment in mentalization activities may lead to functional weakening and structural changes in the related neural networks, consistent with the basic rule of "use it or lose it".</p>
            
            <p>On the other hand, <strong>Empathic Alienation</strong> may occur during human-machine interaction. When individuals become accustomed to accepting "objective" emotional labels output by algorithms (e.g., "the other party's anger level is 85% at this moment"), their subjective emotional experience and empathy process may be recalibrated or even replaced. This substitution not only changes the mechanism of empathy but may also blur the boundary between real emotional signals and algorithmic inferences, making human understanding of others' psychological states tend towards standardization, fragmentation, and de-contextualization.</p>
            
            <p>From the perspective of philosophy of technology, this issue actually touches upon the symbiotic relationship between human cognition and the technological environment. Intelligent systems here are no longer neutral tools but "cognitive partners" that actively participate in shaping human cognitive patterns. When the mentalization process relies on external algorithms, this fundamental human ability of understanding others is undergoing an unprecedented "outsourcing" and "mediation".</p>

            <h2>Research Hypotheses: The Tipping Point of Technology Dependence and Neural Reshaping</h2>
            <p>Based on the above theoretical analysis, we propose the following core hypotheses:</p>
            
            <p><strong>H1</strong>: Individuals who frequently use AI social assistance tools (e.g., emotion recognition apps, chatbots, social recommendation algorithms) for extended periods will show a systematic decline in the accuracy, depth, and speed of their mentalization when facing real interpersonal interactions, and this effect intensifies with increased usage duration;</p>
            
            <p><strong>H2</strong>: The degree of an individual's reliance on AI mentalization suggestions is negatively correlated with the neural activation intensity of the social brain network (especially the Default Mode Network and the mirror neuron system), indicating that long-term technology use may trigger inhibitory neuroplastic changes;</p>
            
            <p><strong>H3</strong>: When AI systems make erroneous inferences, highly dependent users not only show more obvious cognitive dissonance but also exhibit a stronger tendency for trust repair (i.e., continuing to choose to trust the algorithm over their own judgment), reflecting significant impairment of mentalization autonomy.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Methodological Concept: Multimodal Tracking and Simulated Experimental Design</h2>
            <p>To verify the above hypotheses, this study designs a multi-method approach integrating longitudinal tracking, neuroimaging, and behavioral experiments:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Longitudinal Cohort Study (3-Year Cycle)</h3>
            <p>Recruit 600 adults aged 18-45, divided into high, medium, and low frequency groups based on their usage frequency of AI social tools. Conduct a systematic assessment annually, including: mentalization behavioral tests (e.g., Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, multidimensional empathy scales), social behavior log analysis, and measurements of AI usage frequency and dependence level. Analyze the causal relationship between usage frequency and changes in mentalization ability using hierarchical linear models.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Experiment</h3>
            <p>Select 40 participants each from the high and low dependence groups from the longitudinal sample to perform a dual-task paradigm of "autonomous mentalization" and "AI-assisted mentalization". In the task, participants need to judge the emotional state of virtual characters; in one set of trials, they are allowed to use AI suggestions, while in another set, they must judge completely autonomously. Focus on comparing the differences between the two groups in activation intensity, functional connectivity patterns, and decision-making time within the social brain network (e.g., DMN, anterior cingulate cortex, superior temporal sulcus).</p>
            
            <h3>3. Virtual Reality Scenario Simulation</h3>
            <p>Construct a VR social scenario with high ecological validity, embedding an AI psychological state inference system within it. Periodically introduce "erroneous inferences" by the AI (e.g., misjudging sadness as anger), record participants' error correction behaviors, emotional reactions (physiological indicators), and subsequent trust adjustment strategies to evaluate the behavioral manifestations and emotional cost of empathic alienation.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Potential Findings and Theoretical Significance</h2>
            <p>If the study supports the hypotheses, we may obtain the following findings:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Establish the <strong>critical threshold for AI social tool usage</strong>. For example, when the daily acceptance of AI mentalization suggestions exceeds a certain number (e.g., 15 times) and persists for more than 6 months, participants' mentalization ability may show significant degradation.</li>
                
                <li>Reveal the neural mechanism of <strong>digital mentalization</strong>. Results may show that the high usage group has weakened social brain network activation during autonomous mentalization, while presenting a "neural saving" mode under AI-assisted conditions—this suggests that the brain may reallocate mentalization processing resources, forming a persistent dependence on external systems.</li>
                
                <li>Propose the <strong>Human-AI Mentalization Theory</strong>. This theory posits that, under the infiltration of intelligent technology, mentalization is no longer a traditional binary relationship but transforms into a ternary interactive cycle of "human-machine-human". Here, AI acts not only as a tool but also as an "agent" and "mediator" in the cognitive and emotional process, thereby reshaping the essence and boundaries of empathy.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Practical Implications: Towards Warm Human-Machine Collaboration</h2>
            <p>This study not only has theoretical value but also brings urgent practical significance. If mentalization offloading and empathic alienation do occur, the design philosophy of many current AI emotional interaction systems needs to be re-examined: we should avoid designing AI as a "substitute" for empathy but rather as a <strong>collaborator that enhances human mentalization ability</strong>. For example, systems could provide multiple emotional possibilities instead of a single label, encouraging users to make autonomous judgments and verifications; or embed a "mentalization training mode" to promote users' cognitive participation while providing assistance.</p>
            
            <p>The education and mental health fields also need to respond to this challenge by developing "digital age empathy literacy" courses to help the public maintain the authenticity and sensitivity of emotional understanding in a technological environment. Ultimately, how to protect and extend the ability and warmth of human empathy in human-machine collaboration will become a core psychological challenge of the intelligent age—this concerns not only individual well-being but also the emotional civilization of future society.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Is artificial intelligence quietly outsourcing "understanding others," one of humanity's most precious abilities? This article attempts to reveal this long and隐蔽 (concealed/hidden) transformation through theoretical analysis and empirical design. Regardless of the outcome, this issue has already transcended academic discussion, calling for a profound reflection on the humanization of technology.</p>
