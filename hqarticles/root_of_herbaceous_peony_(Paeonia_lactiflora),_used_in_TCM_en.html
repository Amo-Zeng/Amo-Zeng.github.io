            <h3>I. White Peony: A Treasure of Traditional Medicine</h3>
            <p>The medicinal history of White Peony can be traced back over two thousand years to the "Shen Nong's Herbal Classic," where it was classified as an upper-grade herb, described as capable of "relieving abdominal pain caused by evil qi, removing blood stasis, breaking hard masses, alleviating pain, and enhancing qi." In subsequent generations' herbal classics, the effects of White Peony were continuously explored and enriched, covering aspects such as pain relief, blood nourishment, menstrual regulation, liver-softening, urgency relief, and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
            <p>Traditional Chinese medicine holds that White Peony is slightly cold in nature, bitter and sour in taste, and enters the liver and spleen meridians. Its primary functions include nourishing blood and regulating menstruation, soothing the liver to alleviate pain, and inhibiting yin to stop sweating. In clinical applications, White Peony is commonly used to treat symptoms caused by liver qi stagnation and blood deficiency, such as hypochondriac pain, abdominal pain, irregular menstruation, and dysmenorrhea, as well as yin deficiency-induced night sweats and spontaneous sweating. This focus on nourishing liver blood reflects the TCM concept of "preventing disease," emphasizing the balance of internal regulation to achieve disease prevention.</p>
