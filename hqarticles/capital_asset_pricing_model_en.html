            <h2>Article 1: Reconstructing Market Beta from a Neurofinance Perspective</h2>
            <h3>Optimization Highlights</h3>
            <p><strong>Title Focused on Core Innovation:</strong> "Dynamic Neuro-Beta Pricing: Integrating Cognitive Neural Mechanisms with the Capital Asset Pricing Model"</p>
            <p><strong>Enhanced Abstract Emphasizing Contributions:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>**Abstract**  
Traditional Capital Asset Pricing Models (CAPM) assume homogeneous rational investors and rely on historical data to estimate static beta coefficients, failing to explain risk pricing heterogeneity in digital asset markets. This paper proposes a **Neuro-Beta** paradigm, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to capture amygdala activation patterns in response to systemic risks, thereby constructing dynamic risk metrics. Key innovations include:  
(1) Introducing the **Amygdala Volatility Coefficient (AVC)** to quantify the neurobiological basis of risk aversion;  
(2) Developing a Dynamic Neuro-CAPM with time-varying β_{Neuro}(t);  
(3) Revealing the neuro-beta divergence mechanism between Bitcoin and traditional stock markets (|Δt=2.31, p<0.01|).  
Empirical results show Neuro-Beta improves explanatory power by 47% during market volatility, providing neuroscientific evidence for digital asset pricing.</code></pre>
            <h3>Problem-Oriented Introduction Enhancement</h3>
            <blockquote>The limitations of CAPM stem not only from irrational biases confirmed by behavioral finance but also reflect fundamental neural-level heterogeneity. For instance, Knutson et al. (2007) found that amygdala activation in response to anticipated losses explains 74% of risk decision variance. Building on this, our study proposes...</blockquote>

            <h2>Article 2: Dual-Layer Pricing Model for Climate Beta Premium</h2>
            <h3>Optimization Highlights</h3>
            <p><strong>Title Highlighting Differential Contributions:</strong> "Bidirectional Transmission of Climate Risk: A Stratified Asset Pricing Model Based on Physical Risk Beta and Transition Risk Beta"</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract Clarifying Stratification Mechanism:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>**Abstract**  
Addressing the shortcomings of homogeneous climate risk modeling, this paper proposes a dual-layer climate beta pricing theory:  
- **Physical Risk Beta (β_P)**: Spatial epidemic model + geographic coordinate weighting of fixed assets  
- **Transition Risk Beta (β_T)**: Markov regime-switching model for policy sensitivity  
Key innovations include:  
(1) Designing the **Climate Policy Sensitivity Coefficient (CPS)** to dynamically capture carbon policy shocks;  
(2) Constructing the **Climate Vulnerability Adjustment Factor (CVA)** to quantify regional heterogeneity;  
(3) Discovering a 43% post-Paris Agreement β_T premium surge in high-carbon firms (t=5.21).  
The model reduces pricing errors for climate-sensitive assets from 38.7% (traditional CAPM) to 9.8%, providing actionable tools for TCFD disclosures.</code></pre>

            <pre><code>### 3.2 Byzantine Adaptation Coefficient (BAF)  
\[
BAF_i = \underbrace{\frac{\text{Node Dispersion Entropy}}{\text{Maximum Entropy}}}_{\text{Decentralization Degree}} \times \exp\left(-\frac{\text{Historical Vulnerabilities}}{\text{Audit Count}}\right)  
\]  
*Note: Shannon entropy measures geographic/IP distribution dispersion*

### 3.3 Shapley Value Governance Premium  
Calculating marginal governance contributions from on-chain proposal data:  
\[
\phi_i(v) = \sum_{S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|! (n-|S|-1)!}{n!} [v(S \cup i) - v(S)]  
\]  
*Where v(S) = Probability of coalition S passing critical proposals*</code></pre>
