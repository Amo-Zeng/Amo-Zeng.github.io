            <h3>Non-Material Experiences of Beauty: Emotional Resonance Beyond Materiality</h3>
            <p>Firstly, music, as a typical non-material experience of beauty, holds significant influence. Music, through melody, rhythm, and harmony, can directly touch human emotions and evoke resonance in listeners. For instance, Beethoven's "Symphony No. 5" with its stirring melody and profound emotional expression, has inspired countless listeners, providing them with spiritual solace and strength. The beauty of music transcends material limitations, directly affecting the human soul, and becoming an essential part of the human spiritual world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, literary works also impact humans on a non-material level through the power of words. Literature, with its skillful use of language, depicts a rich emotional world and intellectual realm, evoking deep emotional resonance in readers. For example, Shakespeare's dramatic works, with their profound thoughts and vivid language, have left a significant mark in literary history and have sparked strong emotional resonance in countless readers, becoming an integral part of their spiritual world.</p>
            <p>Artworks, particularly paintings and sculptures, though possessing certain material forms, derive their beauty more from the non-material spiritual level. Artworks convey the artist's thoughts and emotions through combinations of color, line, and form, evoking deep emotional resonance in viewers. For instance, Van Gogh's "Starry Night," with its unique colors and lines, conveys the artist's inner loneliness and yearning, eliciting strong emotional resonance in viewers, and becoming an essential part of their spiritual world.</p>
