            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Educational subsidies have long been a key tool in promoting educational equity and improving the quality of education, playing an irreplaceable role in the education systems of countries worldwide. However, as societal needs become increasingly diverse and educational goals deepen, the traditional educational subsidy model is gradually showing its limitations. From a single "results-oriented" evaluation system, to a broad "universal" coverage model, and then to the functional limitation of "single financial support," the transformation of the traditional educational subsidy model is already urgent. This article aims to explore the new model of educational subsidies from "results-oriented" to "process incentives," from "universal" to "precision," and then towards "multi-faceted empowerment," thereby providing more innovative and feasible ideas for the optimization of future educational subsidy policies.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>I. From "Results-Oriented" to "Process Incentives": The Innovation of the Educational Subsidy Evaluation System</h2>
            <p>The core of the traditional educational subsidy model is often "results-oriented," with resources allocated based on hard indicators such as exam scores and graduation rates to measure student learning outcomes. Although this model ensures a certain level of educational quality, its limitations are increasingly evident. It overemphasizes the "finish line," overlooking the incremental progress students make during their growth; it reduces education to a "score competition," compressing the vast space for students to explore interests and cultivate abilities.</p>
            <p>To address this challenge, the educational subsidy model is shifting from "results-oriented" to "process incentives." The **"process incentives" model** no longer focuses solely on cold "results" but pays more attention to the vibrant performance of students during the learning process. By rewarding students' daily learning behaviors, diverse learning outcomes, and personalized learning resources, this model aims to stimulate students' intrinsic motivation, cultivate good learning habits, and promote their all-around development.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rewarding Learning Behaviors</strong>: Focusing on students' daily learning behaviors, such as classroom participation, homework completion, and extracurricular reading, and guiding students to develop good learning habits through a reward mechanism.</li>
                <li><strong>Rewarding Learning Outcomes</strong>: Expanding the scope of rewards to include scientific research, artistic creation, social practice, and other fields, encouraging students to explore and innovate in different areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Supporting Learning Resources</strong>: Providing students with personalized learning resources, such as online courses, educational software, and extracurricular books, to help them enhance their autonomous learning abilities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The advantage of the "process incentives" model lies in its focus on the learning process, effectively stimulating students' interest in learning, cultivating good habits, and promoting their comprehensive development. However, implementing this model requires a scientific and reasonable evaluation system, the development of diverse and rich learning resources, and the creation of a good educational environment.</p>

            <h2>II. From "Universal" to "Precision": The Innovation of the Educational Subsidy Distribution Model</h2>
            <p>Traditional educational subsidy policies are mostly "universal" models, providing equal standard funding to all eligible students. This model has played an important role in ensuring educational equity, but it also has obvious limitations. Universal subsidies lack specificity and cannot fully consider the personalized needs of different students, leading to inefficient resource allocation, and some students do not receive sufficient support.</p>
            <p>To address this problem, the distribution model of educational subsidies is shifting from "universal" to "precision." Using advanced technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence, education departments can accurately identify students' personalized needs and accordingly make precise subsidy allocations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Precise Identification of Needs</strong>: Through big data analysis, accurately identify the specific needs of groups such as impoverished students, left-behind children, and students with special education needs, providing targeted subsidy support.</li>
                <li><strong>Precise Matching of Resources</strong>: Based on students' interests and learning needs, match corresponding learning resources, such as programming courses, art training, and sports training.</li>
                <li><strong>Precise Evaluation of Effects</strong>: Establish a scientific evaluation system to dynamically adjust subsidy strategies, ensuring the efficiency and fairness of the subsidy policy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The advantage of the precision subsidy model lies in its ability to improve the efficiency of resource use, better meet students' personalized needs, and thus promote both educational equity and quality. However, implementing this model requires strong technical support, a scientific evaluation system, and a collaborative mechanism involving multiple parties.</p>

            <h2>III. From "Single Financial Support" to "Multi-Faceted Empowerment": The Innovation of the Educational Subsidy Function Model</h2>
            <p>The traditional educational subsidy model mainly provides financial support, which has played an important role in alleviating economic pressure and promoting educational equity. However, its single form is difficult to cover the diverse needs of students' growth. As societal needs diversify, mere financial support is insufficient to meet students' comprehensive development needs.</p>
            <p>To address this challenge, the "Education Subsidy+" model has emerged. This model combines traditional financial support with diversified educational services, providing students with more comprehensive support and empowerment.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Education Subsidy + Psychological Counseling</strong>: Provide psychological counseling services for students with psychological health needs, helping them relieve academic pressure and laying a healthy psychological foundation.</li>
                <li><strong>Education Subsidy + Career Planning</strong>: Provide career planning guidance for students to help them clarify learning goals and career directions.</li>
                <li><strong>Education Subsidy + Innovation and Entrepreneurship</strong>: Provide resources such as entrepreneurship training and project incubation for students with innovation and entrepreneurship intentions, stimulating their innovative potential.</li>
                <li><strong>Education Subsidy + International Exchange</strong>: Provide opportunities for outstanding students to study, intern, or attend international conferences abroad, broadening their international horizons.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The advantage of the "Education Subsidy+" model lies in its multifaceted empowerment, which can more comprehensively enhance students' overall quality. This model not only focuses on students' academic abilities but also strengthens their psychological resilience, career competence, innovation capabilities, and international perspectives, laying a solid foundation for their future development.</p>

            <h2>IV. Future Outlook: Building a Multi-Faceted Educational Subsidy System</h2>
            <p>The innovation of educational subsidy models is not only a profound transformation but also a multidimensional shift involving evaluation systems, distribution models, and functional models. The future educational subsidy system needs to further refine the "process incentives," "precision," and "multi-faceted empowerment" models under the framework of technological drive, multi-party collaboration, and balancing equity and efficiency, thus building a more systematic and diversified educational subsidy system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technological Drive</strong>: Using big data and artificial intelligence to accurately identify students' personalized needs and dynamically adjust subsidy strategies to ensure the effective use of resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Party Collaboration</strong>: Governments, social organizations, enterprises, and educational institutions jointly participate in providing diverse educational services and support for students.</li>
                <li><strong>Balancing Equity and Efficiency</strong>: Pay special attention to students in rural and remote areas, ensuring they can also enjoy diverse educational services, thereby achieving the dual goal of educational equity and quality.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through this strategy that balances equity and efficiency, we can provide more comprehensive support to each student, helping them achieve comprehensive development in mental health, career planning, innovation and entrepreneurship, and international perspectives.</p>
