            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study constructs a three-dimensional analytical framework of "Nostalgia Production-Algorithm Governance-Trust Code" to reveal the transformation mechanisms of food safety culture in the digital era. In 2023, Chinese consumers' digital food safety participation reached 67.3% (CFSA, 2023), while risk perception dispersion widened by 15.2 percentage points year-on-year. The innovative TRUST-E governance model is proposed to provide systematic solutions for digital food safety governance.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Topology in Technological Evolution</h2>
            <p>McKinsey reports show a 28% increase in global food industry digital investment in 2022, yet consumer trust index declined by 11%. This research transcends technological functionalism, establishing a dynamic spiral framework of "Deconstruction-Reconstruction-Reinstitutionalization" from a cultural topology perspective.</p>

            <h3>1. Nostalgia Production: Cultural Politics of Digital Longing</h3>
            <h4>1.1 Memory Reconstruction and Cognitive Discounting</h4>
            <p>79% of Generation Z encounter traditional craftsmanship through short videos but prefer industrial products. Modified hyperbolic discounting model: δ = α/(1+βD), revealing technological compensation mechanisms of digital nostalgia.</p>
            
            <h4>1.2 Landscape Production of Rural Symbols</h4>
            <p>Ancient brewing technique videos achieved 142% annual view growth, yet less than 7% of live-stream viewers understand actual processes, validating Baudrillard's "hyperreal simulation order" theory.</p>

            <h3>2. Algorithm Governance: Breaking Cognitive Silos</h3>
            <h4>2.1 Cognitive Narrowing in Personalized Recommendations</h4>
            <p>83% reliance on food safety algorithms with Information Cocoon Index (ICI) reaching 0.72. Experimental groups showed 39% improvement in risk identification after exposure to diverse information.</p>
            
            <h4>2.2 Dual Reinforcement of Risk Perception</h4>
            <p>Blockchain traceability materializes microbial risks, while multi-dimensional visualization systems improve regulatory response speed by 58%.</p>
