            <h3>1. Multifunctionality of Urban Green Infrastructure: The Cornerstone of Sustainable Cities</h3>
            <p>Urban green infrastructure is not only a vital part of urban ecosystems, traditionally focused on beautification and air purification. In current environmental governance, we need to rethink its roles and functions from a multifunctional perspective:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rainwater Management and Flood Prevention</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Support</strong>: Studies show that green infrastructure like green roofs can reduce roof runoff by up to 90% (New York City's "Green Roof" initiative). Additionally, green roofs can mitigate the urban heat island effect, saving 10-20% in energy costs annually.</li>
                        <li><strong>Case Study</strong>: New York City's "Green Roof" initiative not only reduced flooding but also improved the urban water cycle by enhancing groundwater recharge through soil infiltration, thereby bolstering the city's flood resilience.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Restoration and Biodiversity</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Support</strong>: The Royal Parks in London increased biodiversity by 30% through introducing native vegetation, while also reducing the urban heat island effect.</li>
                        <li><strong>In-Depth Analysis</strong>: By constructing large parks, wetlands, and green belts, cities not only provide habitats for flora and fauna but also lower urban temperatures through evapotranspiration, enhancing livability. These efforts protect ecosystems and offer natural recreational spaces for residents, fostering community cohesion.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Education and Public Engagement</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Case Support</strong>: Boston's "Green City Plan" features environmental education centers in parks, attracting over 100,000 citizens annually to engage in environmental activities, significantly raising public environmental awareness and participation.</li>
                        <li><strong>In-Depth Analysis</strong>: Through setting up environmental education displays and conducting ecological educational activities, green infrastructure serves as a platform for education and public involvement, not only increasing environmental consciousness but also promoting community sustainable development.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>2. Application of Ecological Economic Models: Achieving a Win-Win Situation for Environmental Governance and Economic Development</h3>
            <p>Ecological economic models incorporate environmental costs into economic considerations, providing new strategies for achieving a win-win situation between environmental governance and economic development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ecological Compensation Mechanisms</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Support</strong>: The EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS) successfully reduced carbon emissions by 20%, bringing in billions in revenue for the government.</li>
                        <li><strong>Case Study</strong>: Sweden's environmental tax policies encouraged businesses to shift towards low-carbon production methods, significantly reducing industrial carbon emissions, making economic development more sustainable.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Green GDP</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Support</strong>: China began piloting Green GDP accounting in 2015, revealing that considering environmental costs, the economic growth rate in some regions would decrease by 20%.</li>
                        <li><strong>In-Depth Analysis</strong>: The introduction of Green GDP makes economic growth data more accurate and comprehensive, reflecting the dependency of economic development on natural resources and pollution costs, prompting governments and enterprises to consider environmental factors in policy and strategy formulation, fostering coordinated economic and environmental development.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>3. Technology Empowering Environmental Governance: A Smart and Sustainable Future</h3>
            <p>Technological advancements are driving innovation in environmental governance, with many new technologies and methods being applied to environmental protection and ecological restoration:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smart Environmental Monitoring Networks</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Support</strong>: Los Angeles, by deploying a smart air quality monitoring network, successfully reduced PM2.5 concentration by 20%.</li>
                        <li><strong>In-Depth Analysis</strong>: Through big data analysis, pollution sources can be identified, and pollution trends predicted. Smart alert systems can forecast environmental events in advance and issue timely warnings, enhancing the efficiency and precision of environmental governance.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Innovations in Environmental Governance Technology</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Case Support</strong>: Australia uses drones to plant over 1,000 hectares of trees annually, Shanghai's smart waste sorting system increased recycling rates by 30%, and American environmental remediation robots automatically remove contaminants in nuclear-polluted areas.</li>
                        <li><strong>In-Depth Analysis</strong>: These technologies not only increase the efficiency of environmental governance but also reduce human costs and risks through automation, promoting large-scale and precise ecological restoration.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Public Engagement and Education</strong>:
