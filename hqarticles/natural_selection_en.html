            <h2>The Dance of Natural Selection and Biological Complexity</h2>
            <p>The increase in biological complexity is largely a result driven by natural selection. In the competitive natural environment, organisms evolve new traits and functions to adapt to the changing environment. These evolutionary processes often involve the refinement of structures and the high integration of functions. From single-celled organisms to multi-celled ones, from simple light-sensitive spots to highly developed visual systems, natural selection has propelled qualitative leaps in organism structure and function.</p>

            <h2>Urbanization: A New Stage for Natural Selection</h2>
            <p>With the acceleration of urbanization, natural selection exhibits new characteristics in urban environments. Urban-dwelling organisms face novel selective pressures such as dense building distribution, artificial light sources, exposure to chemical pollutants, and frequent human disturbances. These new environmental factors force biological populations to rapidly adapt or be eliminated in a short period.</p>

            <h2>Microbial Resistance: Challenges and Opportunities of Natural Selection</h2>
            <p>In the realm of microorganisms, natural selection's shaping of antibiotic resistance is particularly notable. The rapid reproduction and evolution of microorganisms enable them to undergo multiple generations of natural selection in a short time. The use of antibiotics acts as a new selective pressure, allowing microorganisms with resistance genes to survive and reproduce in an antibiotic environment, while those without these genes are eliminated.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Natural selection, a core topic in evolutionary biology, not only drives the evolutionary process from simplicity to complexity but also reveals new adaptation chapters and challenges in urban environments and microbial fields. By deeply understanding the dynamic changes of natural selection, we can better predict and cope with changes in biodiversity and provide scientific bases for the sustainable management of urban ecosystems and issues related to microbial resistance. Natural selection is not only the mystery of life evolution but also a source of wisdom for us when facing complex ecological challenges.</p>
