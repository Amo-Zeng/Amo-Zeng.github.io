            <h2>Budget Management: From Control to Activation, Building a Data-Driven Eco-Win-Win</h2>
            <p>In the ever-changing business environment, budget management has evolved from a traditional cost control tool to a core engine that drives resource activation, data-driven decision-making, and eco-win-win scenarios. Traditional budget management focuses on cost control and financial stability. However, in the context of intensified market competition and digital transformation, enterprises need a more flexible, dynamic, and strategically-oriented budget management model to navigate the complex and volatile market environment, and to achieve resource sharing and collaborative development within the ecosystem.</p>
