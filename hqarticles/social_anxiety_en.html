            <h2>Cultural Dilemmas in the Digital Age: Striking a Balance Between Fragmentation and Depth</h2>
            <p>In the age of information explosion, we face a paradox in cultural cognition: while access to knowledge has never been easier, deep thinking is becoming increasingly rare. This contradictory phenomenon reveals an underlying issue in contemporary cultural transmission that requires us to reevaluate the relationship between digital media and the inheritance of traditional culture.</p>

            <h3>I. A Paradigm Shift in Cultural Transmission</h3>
            <p>The digital transformation of traditional opera offers a typical example to observe cultural evolution. When Peking Opera performances are delivered through short video platforms, the artistic integrity of the genre risks being undermined. While a three-minute highlights version of "Farewell My Concubine" receives millions of likes on Douyin (China's TikTok), the original three-hour performance is rarely watched in full. This phenomenon of "cultural compression" is not limited to performing arts—it is equally apparent in the domain of literary reading. Statistics show that video summaries of classic literary works have 47 times more views than the downloads of the actual e-books, illustrating how cognitive substitution is reshaping people’s understanding of culture.</p>
            <p>Digital media brings more than just changes in transmission channels—it is a revolution of cognitive patterns. Hyperlinks create non-linear reading routes, multimedia reshapes single-sensory reception, and algorithms reconstruct mechanisms for content selection. Together, these changes have led to a transformation from "deep reading" to "shallow browsing" in cultural consumption.</p>

            <h3>II. The Cultural Cost of the Attention Economy</h3>
            <p>Social media’s "information cocoons" are creating new forms of cultural isolation. According to recent studies, the average Internet user today is exposed to as much information in a single day as a person in the 15th century would have encountered in a lifetime. Yet, true engagement with this information remains limited.</p>
            <p>In an era dominated by algorithms competing for attention, the rebuilding of cultural depth requires us to explore a third way—one that neither rejects technological change nor abandons intellectual substance. Just as German philosopher Walter Benjamin once anticipated in the "age of mechanical reproduction," authentic cultural continuity lies not in the preservation of form, but in rediscovering the contemporary value of tradition in new technical contexts. This may be the most important cultural mission of our time—to preserve a space for deep thinking amid the flood of digital information.</p>
