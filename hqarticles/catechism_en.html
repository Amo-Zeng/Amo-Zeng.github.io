            <h2>The Revolution in Personalized Learning: From Knowledge Infusion to Competency Building in Future Education</h2>
            <p>Since the Industrial Revolution, the field of education has been deeply influenced by the concept of "scale." Standardized curricula, batch-based teaching, and unified assessments have become the cornerstone of traditional education. While this "mass production" model of education has been instrumental in disseminating knowledge and improving efficiency, it has also gradually revealed its limitations: uniform teaching models struggle to meet the diverse learning needs, and batch-produced "standard parts" cannot meet society's demand for innovative talents.</p>

            <h3>Technological Advancements Drive Education Toward "Personalization"</h3>
            <p>With the rise of emerging technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence, education is undergoing an unprecedented transformation. Technological advancements have broken the shackles of "scale" and are driving education toward "personalization." Precise data analysis can outline the unique profiles of each learner: learning preferences, knowledge reserves, cognitive characteristics, developmental potential, and other personalized features come to light. Based on these accurate profiles, education can transition from "one size fits all" to "one size fits one."</p>

            <h3>Comprehensive Innovation in Personalized Learning Systems</h3>
            <p>The establishment of a personalized learning system requires comprehensive innovation in curriculum design, teaching methods, and evaluation systems:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Modular Curriculum Design:</strong> Break away from traditional linear teaching models, disassemble the knowledge system into freely combinable cognitive modules. Learners can choose learning content and paths according to their own characteristics and learning goals, achieving personalized knowledge construction.</li>
                <li><strong>Intelligent Learning Assistants:</strong> Utilize artificial intelligence technology to equip each learner with a dedicated learning assistant, which monitors learning progress in real-time, provides personalized learning suggestions, adjusts learning difficulty automatically, ensuring that learning always stays within the "zone of proximal development," achieving intelligent guidance in learning.</li>
                <li><strong>Diversified Evaluation System:</strong> Break away from the single test-based evaluation model, establish a comprehensive evaluation system that covers academic performance, learning attitude, practical ability, innovative thinking, and other dimensions, providing each learner with a comprehensive and objective growth feedback, achieving diversified development in evaluation.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Transition from "One-Way Output" to "Two-Way Interaction"</h3>
            <p>In traditional learning models, teachers output information unidirectionally, and students receive it passively. This model is inefficient and lacks engagement, making it difficult to meet the needs of talent cultivation in the digital era. To reconstruct learning scenarios, the key is to break the barriers of "one-way output" and build a "two-way interaction" learning ecosystem.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Conceptual Shift: From "Knowledge Infusion" to "Competency Building."</strong> In the digital era, the speed of knowledge updating is unprecedented, and traditional "cramming" teaching methods are no longer able to meet future challenges. The core of learning is no longer just the mastery of specific knowledge, but more importantly, the cultivation of critical thinking, problem-solving capabilities, teamwork, and other core competencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Methodological Shift: From "Teacher-Led" to "Teacher-Student Co-Creation."</strong> In traditional classroom teaching, teachers are the authority of knowledge, and students are recipients of knowledge. In the "two-way interaction" learning scenario, teachers shift to become facilitators and enablers of learning, while students actively participate in learning.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Shift: From "Physical Space" to "Virtual Community."</strong> The rapid development of digital technology offers infinite possibilities for the transformation of learning scenarios. Applications of online learning platforms, virtual reality technology, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies break the limitations of physical space, creating a virtual learning community.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Transition from "Knowledge Transmission" to "Competency Development"</h3>
            <p>The world is in the midst of an unprecedented great transformation, with technological and industrial revolutions on the rise, and the globalization process accelerating, leading to profound changes in society's demand for talent. The traditional school education model, primarily focused on knowledge transmission, can no longer meet the requirements of era development. Cultivating comprehensive talents with core competencies capable of facing future challenges has become an important direction for educational reform and development.</p>
            <p>Core competencies refer to the essential qualities and key abilities that students need to adapt to lifelong development and social development, transcending traditional knowledge and skills, and emphasizing the integration of knowledge, abilities, and attitudes.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The revolution in personalized learning is reshaping the future of education. From "one size fits all" to "one size fits one," from "one-way output" to "two-way interaction," from "knowledge infusion" to "competency building," every transformation in education is a positive response to the demands of the times. Personalized learning is not only a reconfiguration and deep mining of educational resources, but also a return to the essence of education.</p>
