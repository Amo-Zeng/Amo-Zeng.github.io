            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are not only critical issues in drug development and clinical applications but also exhibit the unpredictability of "black swan events" and the cascading characteristics of the "butterfly effect," sometimes posing serious threats to patient lives. Traditional monitoring methods rely on passive reporting systems, which suffer from issues such as latency and high underreporting rates, making it difficult to meet the modern medical demand for precision and real-time data. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, its application in the prediction and management of adverse drug reactions shows great potential. This article will delve into the current status and challenges, the application of AI technology, and ethics and privacy in this field. By integrating the multidimensional impacts of "black swan events" and the "butterfly effect," we will propose comprehensive strategies for effective response.</p>

            <h2>"Black Swan Events": Unpredictable Major Challenges</h2>
            <h3>Case Study Analysis</h3>
            <h4>Thalidomide Teratogenic Event</h4>
            <p>In the late 1950s, thalidomide was widely used as a sedative and anti-nausea drug for pregnancy, but soon it was linked to thousands of cases of newborn deformities. This event exposed serious flaws in the then-current drug regulatory system and highlighted the unpredictability of potential adverse drug reactions.</p>
            <h4>Vioxx Incident</h4>
            <p>Vioxx, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, was used to relieve pain and inflammation. However, a 2004 study showed an increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with it, leading to a global recall. This case illustrated the potential long-term risks that new drugs may not fully assess during clinical trials.</p>
            <h3>Exploring Inducing Factors</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Rapid Emergence of New Drugs</strong>: The development of biotechnology and genetic engineering has led to complex new drug mechanisms, potentially introducing unknown risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Limitations in Clinical Trial Scale</strong>: Clinical trials are typically conducted in relatively limited patient populations, making it difficult to fully reflect the drug's safety across a broader range.</li>
                <li><strong>Complexity of Patient Variations</strong>: Factors such as genetic background, metabolic capacity, and concurrent medications can lead to individual differences in adverse drug reactions.</li>
            </ol>
