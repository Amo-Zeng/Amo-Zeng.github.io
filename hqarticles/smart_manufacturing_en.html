            <h3>2. Human-Machine Collaboration: Redefining Human Value</h3>
            <p>In smart manufacturing, the value of humans is redefined, transitioning from "manual laborers" to "knowledge workers" and "innovators." The traditional "machine replacing humans" mindset overlooks the unique value of humans in knowledge accumulation, creativity, and complex decision-making, while the "human-machine collaboration" paradigm views machines as extensions and assistants to humans, freeing humans from heavy physical labor and repetitive tasks to focus on more creative and strategic work.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Collaborative Robots (Cobots)</strong>
                    <p>Collaborative robots are flexible and safe, enabling them to work alongside humans in the same workspace, accomplishing tasks such as precision assembly and quality inspection, significantly enhancing production efficiency and safety.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Technologies</strong>
                    <p>VR technology provides operators with an immersive training environment, allowing them to simulate real production scenarios in a virtual space, enhancing operational skills; AR technology overlays virtual information onto the real world, assisting engineers in product design and production process optimization.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Digital Twin Technology</strong>
                    <p>Digital twin technology maps the real-world factory into a virtual space, allowing engineers to monitor, analyze, and optimize the production process in real-time, improving efficiency and quality while reducing production costs. For example, Siemens' Amberg factory has achieved comprehensive digitization and visualization of the production process through digital twin technology.</p>

            <h3>3. Service Manufacturing: The Transformation of Value Creation Models</h3>
            <p>Smart manufacturing not only changes production methods but critically reshapes the value creation models of the manufacturing industry. The transition from "product manufacturing" to "service manufacturing" signifies that the manufacturing industry is evolving from a single product provider to a comprehensive service provider.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The "Product as a Service" Model</strong>
                    <p>In the era of service manufacturing, business models such as "Product as a Service" (PaaS) and "Solution as a Service" (SaaS) have emerged. Manufacturing companies no longer simply sell products but provide products as a service to users, who pay for the value they receive on demand. For example, industrial equipment manufacturers can offer "Equipment as a Service" (EaaS), where users pay based on usage, and the manufacturer is responsible for maintenance, upgrades, and other services.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Full Lifecycle Management</strong>
                    <p>Under the service manufacturing model, manufacturing companies focus more on full lifecycle management of products, providing services at every stage from design, production, and delivery to use, maintenance, and recycling, thereby creating greater value for users. For example, by analyzing user habits through big data, manufacturers can offer personalized product optimization solutions; by remotely monitoring equipment status, manufacturers can predict potential faults in advance and provide timely maintenance services.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Case Study</strong>
