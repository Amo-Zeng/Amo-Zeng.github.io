            <h2>Archaeological Resource Management in the Digital Age: Challenges, Innovations, and Global Cooperation</h2>
            <p>In the context of the global digital revolution, archaeological resource management is undergoing profound transformations. The traditional models of physical preservation and field investigation are no longer sufficient to meet the modern archaeology's urgent needs for data processing, resource integration, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Massive amounts of archaeological data are scattered among different institutions and individuals, forming the phenomenon of "data silos," which not only restricts the effective circulation of information but also hinders the further development of archaeology. At the same time, the globalized process has intensified the complexity of archaeological resource management. How to achieve the protection and revitalization of archaeological resources in a globalized context has become a core issue that contemporary archaeology urgently needs to address. This article will explore the challenges and innovative paths of archaeological resource management in the digital age from three aspects: "breaking data silos," balancing the revitalization and utilization of resources, and integrating global perspectives with local practices.</p>

            <h3>1. Data Silos and Virtual Sites: Innovative Responses in the Digital Age</h3>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technology has brought unprecedented opportunities to archaeological resource management, but it has also exposed the severe problem of "data silos." Massive archaeological data is scattered among multiple institutions and individuals, lacking effective integration and sharing mechanisms, leading to low resource utilization and poor information circulation. How to break "data silos" has become the primary task of archaeological resource management in the digital age. In this context, blockchain technology, virtual reality (VR) technology, and interdisciplinary cooperation have become the core tools for building a "virtual site" platform.</p>
            <h4>1.1 Blockchain Technology: A Tool to Break Data Silos</h4>
            <p>The decentralization, immutability, and transparency of blockchain technology provide a new approach to solving the problem of "data silos." In archaeological resource management, blockchain can create an open and trustworthy data-sharing platform, ensuring the integrity and traceability of data. Through smart contracts, blockchain can automate the management of data usage permissions and benefit distribution, promoting data sharing and collaboration. For example, the origin, modification history, and usage records of archaeological data can be permanently stored through blockchain technology, ensuring its authenticity and reliability. Moreover, the transparency of blockchain allows all data operations to be verified, enhancing trust among participants and effectively reducing barriers to data sharing.</p>
            <h4>1.2 Virtual Reality: Building Immersive Virtual Sites</h4>
            <p>Virtual reality technology provides a new research and display tool for archaeology. Through virtual sites, archaeological data scattered in different locations can be integrated into a virtual space, achieving visualization and interaction. Virtual sites can not only provide researchers with the convenience of virtual field investigations, reducing the cost and risk of traditional fieldwork, but also integrate multidimensional archaeological data (such as geographic information, artifact images, and archaeological reports) to provide multi-level analytical tools for complex archaeological research. Additionally, virtual sites can be open to the public, enhancing public interest in archaeology and awareness of cultural heritage protection through immersive experiences.</p>
            <h4>1.3 Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Public Participation: The Social Value of Virtual Sites</h4>
            <p>Virtual sites are not only the product of technological innovation but also an important platform for promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and public participation. Through virtual sites, archaeology can be deeply integrated with other disciplines (such as history, anthropology, and computer science), driving the flourishing development of interdisciplinary research. For example, researchers from different fields can share data resources and conduct comprehensive research from multiple perspectives. At the same time, virtual sites also provide new ways for public participation in archaeology. The public can participate in the discussion, decision-making, and even crowdfunding support of archaeological projects through virtual platforms, thereby enhancing their sense of responsibility and engagement in cultural heritage protection.</p>

            <h3>2. Revitalization and Cultural Identity: The Balancing Act of Protection and Development</h3>
            <p>Archaeological resources are not only witnesses of history but also important carriers of cultural identity. However, in modern society, the protection of archaeological resources and local economic development are increasingly in conflict. How to achieve the revitalization and utilization of archaeological resources under the premise of protection has become an urgent problem to be solved. Through innovative revitalization models, archaeological resources can be integrated into modern life, enhancing public cultural identity while achieving a win-win situation of economic and social benefits.</p>
            <h4>2.1 Archaeological Theme Parks: Bringing History to Life</h4>
            <p>Archaeological theme parks are an innovative model that combines archaeological sites with the modern tourism industry. By creating cultural spaces that integrate education, entertainment, and leisure around the sites, archaeological sites are transformed from static historical relics into dynamic cultural venues. For example, using virtual reality and augmented reality technology, tourists can "travel" back to ancient times, experiencing historical scenes firsthand and enhancing their cultural identity. In addition, archaeological theme parks can popularize archaeological knowledge through exhibitions and interactive experiences, improving public cultural literacy while driving local economic development.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Cultural Creative Products: Bringing Archaeology into Daily Life</h4>
            <p>The cultural value of archaeological resources can be further extended through cultural creative products. For instance, high-precision replicas of artifacts allow the public to appreciate historical relics up close, while cultural and creative products that combine archaeological elements with modern design can meet the needs of modern people for practicality and aesthetic value. Moreover, digital cultural products such as archaeological-themed games and films can disseminate historical culture in a way that resonates with young people, enhancing public cultural identity.</p>
            <h4>2.3 Immersive Experience Projects: Making the Public Participants in History</h4>
            <p>Immersive experience projects transform the public from passive observers of history into active participants through interactive activities. For example, simulated archaeological excavations allow the public to experience the process of archaeological work firsthand, enhancing their understanding and respect for archaeology; historical drama performances, through role-playing, immerse the public in historical scenes,感受历史的魅力;interactive exhibitions utilize multimedia technology to enable the public to participate in exhibitions through touch, sound, and images, deepening and enriching cultural experiences.</p>
