            <h2>The Application of Kantian Philosophy in Modern Life: From Technology Ethics to Art Education</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The philosophical ideas of Immanuel Kant have not only had a profound impact on the fields of ethics and epistemology but have also found wide application in modern life. This article explores the application of Kantian philosophy in contemporary society from three unique perspectives: technology ethics and deontology, autonomy and modern self-management, and aesthetic judgment in art education.</p>

            <h3>Technology Ethics and Kant's Deontology</h3>
            <p>In today's rapidly advancing technology landscape, we face unprecedented ethical challenges. Cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and gene editing are changing our lives at an unprecedented pace, while also presenting a series of moral dilemmas. In this context, Kant's deontological framework provides a robust framework for exploring these ethical issues.</p>

            <h3>Autonomy and Modern Self-Management</h3>
            <p>Kant's concept of autonomy emphasizes individuals acting through rational self-legislation rather than being driven by external motives or others' wills. How does this spirit of autonomy play out in personal life management, career development, and mental health in today's society?</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Aesthetic Judgment and Art Education</h3>
            <p>Kant's theory of aesthetic judgment, detailed in the "Critique of Judgment," not only opened new paths in aesthetic studies but also provided invaluable guiding principles for art education.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The application of Kant's philosophical ideas in modern society extends beyond academic research, profoundly influencing our daily lives, career development, and educational methods. Through the deontological framework of technology ethics, the self-management mechanism of autonomy, and the application of aesthetic judgment in art education, Kant's ideas provide us with tools and perspectives to address contemporary challenges.</p>
