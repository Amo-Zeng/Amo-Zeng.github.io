            <h2>Dual Challenges of the Digital Age and Nuclear Energy Development</h2>
            <p>Under the dual drivers of digital technology and nuclear energy development, the global nuclear non-proliferation system is facing unprecedented complex challenges. The rapid development of the internet and digital technology has not only provided a new breeding ground for nuclear proliferation but also made the treatment of nuclear waste and the transfer of nuclear technology potential threats to nuclear non-proliferation. This "new dilemma of nuclear proliferation" triggered by the digital age and the demand for nuclear energy is testing the international community's response capabilities in an unprecedented manner.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>I. The Internet and Digital Technology: A New Breeding Ground for Nuclear Proliferation</h3>
            <p>As global society enters the digital age, the widespread application of the internet and digital technology has opened new avenues for nuclear proliferation issues. The anonymity, transnationality, and lack of regulation in cyberspace have made illegal trade in nuclear technology and materials more covert and convenient.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1.1 Digital Anonymity and Covert Nuclear Proliferation Transactions</strong><br>
                    Through encrypted communication and dark web platforms, illegal actors can conduct secret transactions of nuclear technology and materials globally. These transactions leave almost no traceable evidence, rendering traditional physical borders and regulatory measures ineffective in cyberspace. Worse still, internet anonymity not only facilitates nuclear proliferation but also provides the possibility for terrorist organizations and extremist forces to acquire nuclear materials, posing a significant threat to global security.</li>
                <li><strong>1.2 Cyber Hacking Attacks and Data Leak Threats</strong><br>
                    Once cybersecurity systems of nuclear facilities are breached by hackers, sensitive information about nuclear technology and materials could be stolen, and even direct control of nuclear facility operating systems could be compromised, leading to serious security risks. In recent years, many countries' critical infrastructure and energy systems have frequently suffered cyberattacks, with nuclear facilities not being spared. Data leak incidents have further provided opportunities for the illegal proliferation of nuclear technology and materials, increasing the risk of nuclear proliferation significantly.</li>
                <li><strong>1.3 Dissemination of False Information and Manipulation of Public Opinion</strong><br>
                    False information spreads rapidly in cyberspace, providing舆论 support and psychological preparation for nuclear proliferation. Illegal actors manipulate social media and online platforms to spread false information, creating social panic and possibly covering up the true intentions of nuclear proliferation activities. This manipulation of public opinion not only increases the difficulty for the international community to address nuclear proliferation but may also lead to unnecessary conflict escalation and even nuclear warfare.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>II. Nuclear Waste Disposal: A Hidden Link to Nuclear Non-Proliferation</h3>
            <p>The use of nuclear energy is accompanied by the generation of large amounts of nuclear waste, which not only poses environmental threats but also serves as a potential raw material repository for nuclear weapons. The disposal of nuclear waste is intricately linked to nuclear non-proliferation, forming an invisible chain that tightly connects the nuclear waste management dilemma with the fate of global nuclear security.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2.1 Nuclear Waste: A Potential Repository for Nuclear Weapon Materials</strong><br>
                    Nuclear waste contains plutonium-239 and uranium-235, key materials for manufacturing nuclear weapons. Although the concentration of plutonium-239 in spent fuel is low, it can be purified to weapon-grade levels through chemical separation technology. Therefore, the safe disposal of nuclear waste is not only an environmental issue but also a key factor in maintaining the nuclear non-proliferation system.</li>
                <li><strong>2.2 Technological Bottlenecks and Management Loopholes: Hidden Channels for Nuclear Proliferation</strong><br>
                    Many countries face significant technological shortcomings in nuclear waste disposal, lacking advanced spent fuel reprocessing technologies and equipment, resulting in large amounts of nuclear waste not being effectively treated and safely stored. Additionally, security management of nuclear waste disposal facilities also has numerous loopholes, such as inadequate security measures and weak regulatory mechanisms, which may provide opportunities for terrorists or illegal organizations to obtain nuclear materials.</li>
                <li><strong>2.3 Terrorist Threats: Nuclear Waste as Raw Material for "Dirty Bombs"</strong><br>
                    One of the main goals of terrorists in acquiring nuclear materials is to manufacture "dirty bombs," weapons designed to spread radioactive materials and cause panic. Nuclear waste, with its high radioactive content, becomes an ideal target for terrorists. Once nuclear waste is stolen or illegally transferred, terrorists can use it to manufacture "dirty bombs," attacking cities or infrastructure, causing massive psychological panic and environmental pollution, and potentially triggering global nuclear proliferation panic.</li>

            <h3>III. Nuclear Energy Development: The Double-Edged Sword Effect and Proliferation Risks</h3>
            <p>Nuclear power, as a significant force in the clean energy sector, has become a key solution to global climate change and energy crises due to its efficiency, stability, and low carbon emissions. However, the development of nuclear power technology can bring both light to humanity and plant seeds of nuclear proliferation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>3.1 Nuclear Technology Transfer: A Potential Proliferation Risk</strong><br>
                    Nuclear technology transfer is a critical step in nuclear power development, but it may also pose a potential threat to nuclear proliferation. Some countries, in their pursuit of nuclear power, may relax vigilance in nuclear technology transfer, leading to the flow of nuclear technology and materials to unsafe countries or regions, planting seeds of proliferation. For example, certain technology transfer agreements may include sensitive nuclear technology information, which, if misused for military purposes, could seriously threaten the global nuclear non-proliferation system.</li>
                <li><strong>3.2 Nuclear Material Management: A Weak Link in Nuclear Non-Proliferation</strong><br>
                    Nuclear material management is a crucial aspect of nuclear non-proliferation, but during the development of nuclear power, there may be vulnerabilities in the management and monitoring of nuclear materials. If nuclear materials are stolen or illegally transferred, they could provide opportunities for terrorists or unscrupulous individuals to acquire nuclear weapons. For instance, some countries' nuclear power plants may have insufficient security measures, making them easy targets for nuclear material theft. Additionally, some countries may lack effective monitoring during the transportation and storage of nuclear materials, failing to detect and prevent illegal transfers in time.</li>
