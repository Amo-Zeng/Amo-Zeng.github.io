            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Against the backdrop of globalization and technological advancement, population structure changes, technological enabling, and intergenerational differences have become the three core factors profoundly influencing the development of the elderly care system. Globally, the acceleration of the aging process, the reduction in the labor force, and the deterioration of the intergenerational support ratio have posed unprecedented challenges to the sustainability of pension systems. At the same time, the rise of intelligent elderly care technology offers innovative solutions to many pain points of traditional care models. Additionally, the significant differences in pension concepts and behavior among different generations also pose new requirements for the diversified design of the elderly care system. This article explores how to construct a sustainable, intelligent, and diverse elderly care system from the perspectives of population structure changes, technological enabling, and intergenerational differences, addressing current and future pension challenges.</p>

            <h3>I. Population Structure Changes: Global Challenges to Pension Sustainability</h3>
            <h4>1.1 Acceleration of Population Aging and Impact on Pension Systems</h4>
            <p>Globally, the trend of population aging is increasingly prominent. Persistent declines in fertility rates and the extension of life expectancy have led to a rapid rise in the proportion of elderly populations, while the number of working-age populations has gradually decreased, worsening the intergenerational support ratio (the ratio of elderly to working-age populations). This profound demographic change has had a far-reaching impact on pension systems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduction in Contributors and Increased Payment Pressure:</strong> As the working-age population decreases, the contribution base of pensions shrinks, while the number of pension recipients increases, leading to significant funding gaps in pension funds.</li>
                <li><strong>Decline in Asset Returns:</strong> The dual pressures of population aging and economic growth slowdown have caused the investment returns of pension funds to continuously decline, further weakening the fund's ability to preserve and increase value.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.2 Challenges and Limitations of Different Pension Models</h4>
            <p>Currently, pension systems around the world are mainly divided into three models: pay-as-you-go, fully funded, and mixed systems. However, under the global context of population aging, none of these models can remain unaffected:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pay-as-You-Go System:</strong> This model relies on the contributions of the current working population to pay for the pensions of retired populations. However, with the reduction in contributors and increased payment pressure, the pay-as-you-go system faces the risk of expanding funding gaps.</li>
                <li><strong>Fully Funded System:</strong> Although it can achieve long-term fund accumulation, under the dual pressures of population aging and declining asset returns, its investment income is hard to ensure the preservation and appreciation of pensions.</li>
                <li><strong>Mixed System:</strong> Attempting to combine the advantages of the pay-as-you-go and fully funded systems, but in practice, issues with system design and fairness still exist, making it difficult to effectively respond to demographic challenges.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.3 Pathways to Sustainable Pension Development</h4>
            <p>To address the challenges brought by demographic changes, countries need to adopt diversified measures to enhance the sustainability of pension systems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Delaying Retirement Age:</strong> By extending working years, increasing the contributor base, and reducing pension payment pressure, while also extending individual contribution years and increasing individual account accumulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Raising Contribution Rates:</strong> Appropriately increasing pension contribution rates, but balancing the burdens on businesses and individuals to avoid negative impacts on economic development.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimizing Investment Operations:</strong> By improving the investment returns of pension funds, diversifying investment risks, and ensuring the long-term preservation and appreciation of funds.</li>
                <li><strong>Developing a Multi-Layer Pension System:</strong> On the basis of basic pensions, developing supplementary pension plans such as corporate annuities, occupational pensions, and individual savings-based pensions to reduce the burden on basic pensions and build a more diversified pension system.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Technological Enabling: The Rise of Smart Elderly Care</h3>
            <h4>2.1 Technological Foundations of Smart Elderly Care: Big Data, IoT, and AI</h4>
            <p>Smart elderly care relies on the deep integration of cutting-edge technologies such as big data, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI), bringing disruptive changes to traditional care models:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Big Data:</strong> By analyzing health data and behavioral data of the elderly, it enables early warning of chronic diseases, personalized health management, and optimized allocation of community care resources.</li>
                <li><strong>IoT:</strong> Through the connection of smart devices (such as smart bracelets and blood pressure monitors), it monitors the physical condition of the elderly in real time, creating a smart and proactive care environment.</li>
                <li><strong>AI:</strong> Providing services such as intelligent voice assistants and care robots, focusing on affective and cognitive computing to enhance the quality of life and well-being of the elderly.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.2 New Models of Smart Elderly Care: The Fusion of Community-Based and Institutional Care</h4>
            <p>Smart elderly care combines community-based and institutional care through technological means, providing more personalized and intelligent services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Community-Based Care:</strong> By combining online booking with offline services, it integrates community care resources to provide convenient living services. At the same time, it builds a smart, age-friendly home environment to enhance the comfort and safety of the elderly.</li>
                <li><strong>Institutional Care:</strong> Using IoT and big data technologies to achieve smart management, providing personalized service plans, promoting medical and care integration, and improving service quality and efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.3 Opportunities and Challenges of Smart Elderly Care</h4>
            <p>Smart elderly care faces both opportunities and challenges during its development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Opportunities:</strong> Policy support, growing market demand, and technological progress provide broad development space for smart elderly care, making it an important approach to addressing aging issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Issues such as data security, technological implementation, and talent shortages need to be addressed urgently. The future requires strengthening policy guidance, technological innovation, and talent development to promote the application and popularization of smart elderly care.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>III. Intergenerational Differences: A Multidimensional Interpretation of Pension Concepts and Behavior</h3>
            <h4>3.1 Pension Concepts and Behavior of Different Generations</h4>
            <p>Different generations exhibit significant differences in pension concepts and behavior, which stem from differences in their growth environments, value systems, and lifestyles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The 60s Generation: Tradition and Family Dependence</strong>
                    <p>Growing up in the era of planned economy, the 60s generation has more traditional pension concepts, emphasizing "raising children to support the elderly." They prefer to stay at home and rely on their children for care and financial support. In terms of pension behavior, the 60s generation has limited awareness and acceptance of pension products, relying more on basic pensions and family savings to meet future pension needs.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>The 70s Generation: Self-Reliance and Economic Independence</strong>
                    <p>Growing up in the early days of reform and opening-up,
