            <h2>Trauma and Descent in Art History</h2>
            <p>Throughout art history, great artists seem to be closely connected with extreme life experiences: Van Gogh's mental breakdown, Giacometti's existential anxiety, and Van Gogh's self-exile. These seemingly dark marks of life were transformed into beacons that illuminate the human spirit in artistic creation. This transformation is not accidental, but the result of artists finding a unique path to the essence of art through the destruction of trauma, the resolve of descent, and the pursuit of existence.</p>

            <h3>The Light of Trauma: Rebirth After Disintegration</h3>
            <p>Trauma, as an extreme life experience, fundamentally involves the complete disintegration of reality perception. When artists experience trauma, their existing life order, values, and emotional structures are subjected to devastating impact. This disintegration, though seemingly disastrous, provides them with a unique perspective to re-recognize the world. As French writer André Gide once said, "The most profound changes begin with the deepest suffering." Trauma destroys the artists' existing ways of survival, forcing them to understand the world in a new way, thus achieving a paradigm shift in cognition.</p>
            <p>Van Gogh's "Starry Night," created during his mental breakdown, depicts inner turmoil and cosmic mysteries with swirling strokes, elevating personal pain to contemplation of human destiny. The creativity induced by trauma transcends emotional catharsis and becomes a profound inquiry into the essence of life. Just as psychologist Viktor Frankl's harrowing experiences in Nazi concentration camps inspired him to develop logotherapy, artists in trauma break through conventional artistic expression, creating unique and awe-inspiring works—a rebirth of life and a phoenix of art.</p>

            <h3>The Resolve of Descent: The Schism Between Art and Life</h3>
            <p>The purity of art often demands a painful price from artists. Van Gogh's life was akin to that of a ascetic monk, starving himself to refine his art, pouring the weight of his life into every stroke. His series of paintings "The Potato Eaters" depict peasants sharing potatoes under dim lights, while he refused to share in worldly warmth, choosing to sever ties with reality. This schism is not only reflected in Van Gogh's personal life but also mirrors the unbridgeable gap between artistic creation and daily life.</p>
            <p>Artistic creation requires the courage to sever ties with daily life and the purity that borders on self-destruction. It is this resolve that allows artists to roam freely in the wilderness of art, creating heart-wrenching works. Van Gogh's schism represents the ultimate pursuit of artistic purity and a profound reflection on the meaning of life.</p>

            <h3>The Inquiry of Existence: Seeking Truth in Emptiness</h3>
            <p>Giacometti's sculpture "The Walking Man" exhibits a skeletal posture that is both startling and ephemeral, as if about to dissipate with the wind. The post-WWII emptiness in Paris caused survivors to lose their souls among the ruins. Giacometti attempted to capture the state of "existence" with his hands, but every time he gazed at his model, the figure blurred and dispersed into countless distant points.</p>
            <p>This "non-existence" anxiety led him to abandon traditional sculptural volume, opting for extreme simplicity. His sculptures appear startlingly thin, like phantoms in three-dimensional space. Yet it is precisely this "non-existence" that allowed him to touch upon a deeper "existence." Giacometti's work proves that the essence of art lies not in reproducing the appearance of things, but in unveiling the veil of existence.</p>

            <h3>Art: The Bridge to Existence Beyond Trauma and Descent</h3>
            <p>In the journey of artists, trauma, descent, and the inquiry of existence intertwine. Trauma offers them a new perspective to re-recognize the world, descent severs their ties with daily life, and the pursuit of existence guides them towards the essence of art. This transformation is the process by which artists, with extraordinary courage and wisdom, elevate pain into art.</p>
            <p>Van Gogh's severed ear, Van Gogh's hunger, and Giacometti's skeletal sculptures are not merely personal misfortunes but the creation of human spiritual wealth through artistic endeavor. This transformation is the bridge to truth for artists and a crucial opportunity for humanity to understand itself and transcend its limitations.</p>
            <p>Art history teaches us that the greatest art often emerges from the deepest suffering. This is not fate, but the possibility demonstrated by humanity in the face of hardship: to transcend pain with creativity and to interpret trauma through art. The light of trauma illuminates the path of artistic creation and the depths of the human spirit.</p>
