            <h2>Biodiversity: The Blue Treasure Trove of Biomedicine</h2>
            <p>Biodiversity is not only the foundation of ecosystems but also the guardian of human health. The亿万years of evolution in nature have given birth to countless compounds with unique chemical structures and biological activities. The discovery of drugs like paclitaxel and artemisinin is the result of humanity's profound exploration of the mysteries of nature. According to statistics, only about 5% of known natural compounds have been used in drug development, while millions of species on Earth have yet to be thoroughly studied. These unknown forms of life may hold potential drugs for treating cancers, HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, and other intractable ailments. For instance, marine life, due to its unique living environment, has evolved many structurally novel and highly active compounds, becoming an important treasure trove for drug development.</p>

            <h3>Biodiversity: The Resilience of Ecosystems in the Face of Climate Change</h3>
            <p>Biodiversity grants ecosystems powerful resilience, allowing them to maintain stability under the impacts of climate change. Tropical rainforests absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, wetlands mitigate the greenhouse effect through carbon sequestration, and coral reefs regulate ocean temperature and acidity. These ecosystems collectively serve as Earth's climate regulator. However, a single ecosystem is like a house of cards, lacking the ability to cope with extreme climate events. Ecosystems rich in biodiversity are like an orchestra, with each species playing an important role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

            <h3>Biodiversity: The Deep Code of Human Culture</h3>
            <p>Biodiversity is not only a wealth of nature but also the root of human culture. Over the course of evolution, humans have formed a close symbiotic relationship with nature. Indigenous South Americans developed chocolate culture from cocoa beans, traditional Chinese medicine is based on thousands of medicinal plants, Inuit people in the Arctic Circle rely on seals for survival, and the Maasai in Africa dance with wildlife. These cultural traditions are the wisdom crystallized from the long-term interaction between humans and nature, carrying the collective memory and cultural heritage of human groups.</p>

            <h3>Building a Harmonious Future for Humans and Nature</h3>
            <p>Biodiversity is the bond connecting nature and human civilization, the key to maintaining ecosystem stability, driving medical innovation, and carrying cultural heritage. However, climate change, habitat destruction, and the fragmentation of cultural traditions are threatening the survival of this bond. We need to re-examine the value of biodiversity and place it at the core of human development.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Strengthen Biodiversity Protection</strong>: Establish a robust protection system, enhance the protection of endangered species and their habitats, and prevent species extinction.</li>
                <li><strong>Promote Biomedical Research</strong>: Increase efforts to explore unstudied species, uncover their potential medical value, and provide health security for humanity.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhance Ecosystem Resilience</strong>: Restore degraded ecosystems, strengthen their adaptability to climate change, and maintain the stability of Earth's climate.</li>
                <li><strong>Inherit Ecological Culture</strong>: Retain traditional wisdom during modernization, advocate for a harmonious coexisting lifestyle with nature, and let every form of life be a witness to the richness of human culture.</li>
            </ol>
