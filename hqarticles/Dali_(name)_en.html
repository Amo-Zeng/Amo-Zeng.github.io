            <h2>Dalí: The Surreal Prophet Across Time</h2>
            <p>Under the glittering sky of art history, Salvador Dalí shines like a bright comet, forging a spiritual journey across time through his unique artistic style and profound intellectual depth. His works not only serve as the ultimate interpretation of Surrealism but also as prophetic visions of consumer society and the digital era.</p>

            <h3>I. The Light of Reason Illuminates the Surreal Temple</h3>
            <p>Dalí's artistic creations, though seemingly whimsical, are imbued with rigorous rational spirit. He was not merely a recorder of dreams but also a researcher of psychology and a practitioner of visual experimentation. In "The Persistence of Memory," those melting clocks like twisted cheese are not random imaginings but the result of precise calculations.</p>

            <h3>II. A Complex Dance with Consumerism</h3>
            <p>Dalí's artistic journey almost paralleled the rise of consumer society in the 20th century. Mechanical aesthetics are omnipresent in his works, with perfectly symmetrical compositions and lustrous metallic textures, all hinting at the profound infiltration of commodity aesthetics into artistic creation.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Dalí's artistic life is a multifaceted dialogue between reason and irrationality, material and spirit, reality and virtuality, as well as a profound prophecy of the future world. He illuminated the temple of Surrealism with the light of reason, formed a complex symbiosis with consumerism, and foresaw the digital future of virtual reality.</p>
