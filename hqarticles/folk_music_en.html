            <h3>I. Interaction between Ecology and Music: The Natural Sounds of Folk Music</h3>
            <p>Folk music has a deep connection with the natural environment. Many folk melodies are directly influenced by natural landscapes, climate changes, and biodiversity. For instance, in some mountainous regions, melodies often mimic the sound of running water, bird songs, or the wind, creating an art form that coexists harmoniously with nature.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ecological Conservation:</strong> Folk music not only reflects humanity's understanding and reverence for nature but also serves as a tool for ecological education. Through music, people can better understand natural laws and enhance their environmental consciousness.</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainable Development:</strong> The revival of traditional music helps communities to re-recognize the value of natural resources, promoting sustainable lifestyles. This cultural revival aids in reducing environmental degradation and fostering ecological balance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Application of Technology in Folk Music</h3>
            <p>Technological advancements have provided new platforms and tools for folk music, allowing it to spread and evolve on a broader scale.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Digitization:</strong> Through recording technology and digital storage, many endangered folk musics have been preserved and disseminated. Platforms like Spotify and YouTube enable global audiences to experience folk music from various cultures.</li>
                <li><strong>Music Production:</strong> Modern technology makes the creation and production of folk music easier. Electronic instruments, music software, and mixing techniques allow folk music to blend with contemporary pop music, creating novel musical styles.</li>
                <li><strong>Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR):</strong> These technologies can create immersive experiences, making listeners feel as if they are at the origin of folk music, enhancing cultural experiences and educational effects.</li>

            <h3>III. The Role of Folk Music in Psychotherapy</h3>
            <p>The application of folk music in psychotherapy is another manifestation of its diverse values, functioning in several ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Therapeutic:</strong> In music therapy, the melodies and rhythms of folk music help alleviate anxiety, depression, and other emotional disorders. The vibrations of traditional instruments and the rhythm of music can help individuals relax and restore inner peace.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Connection:</strong> For immigrants or those with a low sense of cultural identity, folk music provides a way to connect with their cultural roots, enhancing self-identity and reducing the psychological stress of cultural displacement.</li>
                <li><strong>Group Therapy:</strong> Through collective playing or listening to folk music, individuals can feel the support and sense of belonging from the community, which is significantly effective in treating loneliness and social anxiety.</li>
            </ul>

Folk music is not just a cultural carrier; it is also a bridge connecting humans with nature, tradition with modernity, and individuals with communities. It reminds us that cultural heritage should not merely be seen as a relic of the past but as an active force promoting human development and social harmony.
