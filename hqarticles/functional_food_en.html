            <h2>The Concept of Personalized Nutrition Plans</h2>
            <p>A personalized nutrition plan is a dietary plan designed based on an individual's specific needs. This approach takes into account each person's genetic background, lifestyle, health condition, and personal preferences. Traditional nutritional advice is often generic and cannot fully adapt to individual differences, whereas personalized nutrition plans provide more targeted dietary recommendations through precise data analysis and scientific research.</p>

            <h3>Application of AI and Genomics in Personalized Nutrition</h3>
            <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> plays a crucial role in personalized nutrition plans. Through machine learning algorithms, AI can extract valuable information from large sets of health data to predict individual responses to different nutrients. For example, AI can analyze someone's eating habits, weight changes, blood sugar levels, etc., to devise the most suitable diet plan.</p>
            <p><strong>Genomics</strong> provides deeper personalized data. Through genetic testing, we can understand how an individual's genetic makeup influences the absorption, metabolism, and utilization of nutrients.</p>
