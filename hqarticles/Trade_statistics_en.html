            <h2>The New Global Trade Landscape in the Era of Digital Economy: Intangible Assets, Regional Networks, and Sustainable Transformation</h2>
            <p>In the wave of the digital economy, global trade is undergoing unprecedented profound changes. While traditional trade models dependent on tangible goods still dominate, the value of intangible assets is rising at an astonishing speed, becoming a new engine driving global economic growth. At the same time, the dynamic evolution of regional trade networks reveals a new face of the global economic landscape, and the widespread adoption of sustainable development concepts urgently calls for the green transformation of trade systems and the innovation of evaluation paradigms. These three aspects intertwine and together constitute the new picture of global trade in the era of digital economy.</p>

            <h3>I. Intangible Assets: The New Protagonists of Global Trade</h3>
            <p>In the era of the digital economy, the importance of intangible assets is increasingly prominent, becoming the core source of enterprise competitiveness and the key driver of value creation. Intangible assets not only cover traditional areas such as intellectual property, brand value, and data information but also extend to emerging fields such as business models and professional skills. These assets are efficiently allocated and monetized globally through methods such as technology licensing, patent licensing, and brand franchising, profoundly reshaping the structure and operation mode of the global value chain.</p>
            <p>Trade data, as a barometer of global economic activities, not only records the flow of goods but also contains a wealth of valuable information about intangible assets. By deeply analyzing service trade data, intra-firm trade data of multinational companies, and e-commerce data, we can gain insight into the dynamic changes of the global value chain and explore new drivers of economic growth.</p>

            <h3>II. The Evolution of Regional Trade Networks: Big Data Reveals a New Global Economic Landscape</h3>
            <p>Against the backdrop of deepening globalization, regional trade networks, as an important pillar of the global economy, are undergoing profound restructuring and evolution. Traditional trade statistics often confine themselves to bilateral trade relations between countries, overlooking the complexity and depth of intra-regional trade. However, with the help of big data technology and social network analysis methods, we can map out a more refined global trade network, revealing the dynamic changes of regional economic centers and trade corridors.</p>
            <p>The rise of emerging economic centers, the formation and evolution of trade corridors, and the advancement of regional economic integration are the main trends of the current regional trade network evolution. For example, in Asia, represented by China, India, and Southeast Asian countries, not only hold an important position in commodity trade but also show strong growth potential in service trade and technology transfer.</p>

            <h3>III. The Era of Sustainable Development: Green Transformation of Trade and New Evaluation Paradigms</h3>
            <p>In the context of increasingly severe global environmental crises, the issue of sustainable development of trade has attracted widespread attention. Traditional trade evaluation systems aim solely at economic growth, ignoring environmental and social costs, leading to over-exploitation of resources, ecosystem imbalance, and exacerbation of social injustice. In this context, the "Sustainable Trade Index" has emerged, incorporating environmental and social factors into the evaluation system, providing an important tool for building a fair, inclusive, and sustainable global trade order.</p>
            <p>The Sustainable Trade Index constructs a multidimensional evaluation framework covering environmental impact, social responsibility, economic performance, and other fields. It aims to measure whether a country or region's trade activities, while promoting economic growth, also take into account multiple objectives such as environmental protection, resource conservation, and social equity.</p>

            <h3>IV. The New Global Trade Landscape in the Era of Digital Economy</h3>
            <p>The new global trade landscape in the era of digital economy is shaped by the rise of intangible assets, the evolution of regional trade networks, and the transformation of sustainable trade. These three aspects intertwine and together drive global trade towards a more open, inclusive, beneficial, balanced, and win-win direction.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, we need to further strengthen the following efforts: First, enhance data analysis capabilities, using big data and artificial intelligence technologies to build a comprehensive indicator system reflecting intangible assets, regional trade networks, and sustainable trade; second, deepen international cooperation, promote the interconnection of trade data, and jointly research methods for measuring intangible assets, trends in the evolution of regional trade networks, and evaluation standards for sustainable trade; third, strengthen public participation, raise environmental awareness and social responsibility awareness, guide consumers to choose green and sustainable products, and foster a good atmosphere of society-wide participation.</p>
