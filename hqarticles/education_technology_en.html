Here’s the English translation of your web content about "数甲" (Shu Jia):  

---

**"Shu Jia"** (数学甲类, "Mathematics Category A") typically refers to advanced or competition-level mathematics in the Chinese high school curriculum or math olympiad system. It is more challenging than standard high school math ("Shu Yi" or 数乙). Below is a detailed explanation:  

---

### 1. **Shu Jia vs. Shu Yi**  
- **Shu Jia**: Common in regional curricula (e.g., Shanghai) or math competitions, it covers deeper topics like algebra, geometry, number theory, and combinatorics, approaching university-prep or olympiad levels.  
- **Shu Yi**: Standard high school math (e.g., functions, sequences, probability).  

---

### 2. **Core Topics in Shu Jia**  
- **Algebra**: Polynomials, inequalities, complex numbers, introductory matrices.  
- **Geometry**: Analytic geometry, solid geometry, Power of a Point, Menelaus’ Theorem.  
- **Number Theory**: Divisibility, modular arithmetic, Fermat’s Little Theorem, Chinese Remainder Theorem.  
- **Combinatorics**: Permutations, graph theory, combinatorial identities.  
- **Introductory Calculus**: Limits, derivatives, integrals (partial coverage).  

---

### 3. **Exams & Competitions**  
- **Shanghai Gaokao Reform**: Previously divided into "Shu Jia" (for STEM majors) and "Shu Yi" (basic math).  
- **Math Olympiads**:  
  - **National High School Math League** (一试/二试)  
  - **CMO** (Chinese Mathematical Olympiad) – Shu Jia aligns closely with these syllabi.  

---

### 4. **Study Tips**  
- **Prerequisite**: Master "Shu Yi" (standard curriculum) first.  
- **Resources**:  
  - *Olympiad Tutorials* (《奥数教程》)  
  - *High School Math Competition Training* (《高中数学竞赛培优讲义》)  
- **Practice**: Past league/IMO problems are essential.  

---

### 5. **Other Possible Meanings**  
- **Historical JLPT**: The old Japanese Language Proficiency Test called its vocabulary section "Shu Jia" (now obsolete).  
- **Regional Variations**: Some schools/provinces may define "Shu Jia" differently—verify locally.

**Notes**:  
- Retained pinyin ("Shu Jia/Shu Yi") with English explanations for clarity.  
- Adjusted cultural references (e.g., "Gaokao") for international readers.  
- Listed theorems by their English names (e.g., "Menelaus’ Theorem" instead of transliteration).
