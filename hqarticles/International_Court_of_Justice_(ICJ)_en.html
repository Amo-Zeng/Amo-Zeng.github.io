            <h2>Challenges and Opportunities for the International Court in the Digital Era</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of technology, the international community is facing unprecedented challenges. New types of disputes such as cyber warfare, data breaches, and cross-border data flow disputes are gradually becoming the main contradictions in international relations. These disputes not only involve complex technological issues but also involve national sovereignty, international responsibility, and international cooperation on multiple levels. In this context, the International Court, as an important institution for maintaining international justice, urgently needs to reflect on and reconstruct its existing framework to address these increasingly complex new disputes.</p>

            <h3>New International Disputes Brought by Technological Development</h3>
            <p>The普及普及 of digital technology has made cyberspace a new arena for national competition. Cyber attacks, as a covert and cost-effective means of destruction, are becoming a conventional tool in inter-state competition. Events such as the 2010 "Stuxnet" virus attack on Iran's nuclear facilities and the 2020 Russian cyber attacks on U.S. government agencies highlight the threat of cyber warfare to national security. At the same time, data breaches and cross-border data flow disputes are becoming increasingly prominent. With the acceleration of globalization, data of multinational companies and individuals flows between different countries, making it a major challenge for the international community to balance data privacy protection and data free flow.</p>
            <p>These new disputes are highly complex and technical, making it difficult for traditional international law frameworks to address them. Cyber attacks often span multiple sovereign states, with the source of attacks difficult to trace, and victims and perpetrators often scattered around the globe. Data breach issues involve multiple considerations such as privacy rights, national security, and economic interests. Finding a balance point among different interests is a new challenge for international law.</p>

            <h3>Limitations of the Existing Framework of the International Court</h3>
            <p>In the face of these new disputes, the existing framework of the International Court shows significant limitations. The first is the issue of jurisdiction. Under current rules, the jurisdiction of the International Court depends on the consent of the states involved, which is insufficient when dealing with cross-border disputes such as cyber attacks and data breaches. Many cyber attack events involve multiple parties, making it difficult to determine the specific responsible party, leading to difficulties in enforcing jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>Secondly, evidence collection and liability determination also face huge challenges. The anonymity and technical complexity of cyberspace make evidence acquisition and preservation extremely difficult. Traditional judicial procedures struggle to adapt to the characteristics of digital evidence, such as the ease of tampering and the vast amount of data. Additionally, liability determination is extremely complex. Cyber attacks often involve multiple actors, including state actions and possibly non-state actors, making the attribution and allocation of responsibility a major challenge.</p>
            <p>Finally, the lack of an enforcement mechanism is another major challenge of the existing framework. Due to the cross-border nature of cyber attacks and data breaches, executing judgments often faces numerous obstacles. Ensuring the effective enforcement of judgments is a key issue for the International Court to address.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The International Court faces unprecedented challenges in the digital era, but it also holds significant opportunities. By reflecting on and reconstructing its existing framework, the International Court can play a more important role in maintaining international justice and promoting international cooperation. This requires the concerted efforts of the international community to develop an international legal framework that better meets the needs of the digital era to address increasingly complex new disputes.</p>
