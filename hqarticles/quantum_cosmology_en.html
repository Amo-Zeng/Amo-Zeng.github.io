            <h2>New Perspectives in Quantum Cosmology: Meaning Construction, Dynamic Interaction, and Theological Transcendence</h2>
            <p>In modern physics, quantum mechanics not only reveals the behavioral laws of the microcosm but profoundly influences our understanding of the macrocosm. Traditional quantum cosmology focuses on how microscopic quantum states evolve into the macroscopic universe. However, this article will explore new dimensions of quantum cosmology from three new perspectives: meaning construction in "quantum foam," the shift from "measurement" to "interaction" in our cosmological view, and "quantum theology." These perspectives not only challenge existing theories but also provide us with a novel framework for understanding and constructing the universe.</p>

            <h3>Meaning Construction in "Quantum Foam"</h3>
            <p>Quantum mechanics reveals the non-locality and uncertainty of the microcosm. How do these characteristics shape our understanding of the meaning of the universe? Quantum foam is the universe's initial "raw material," manifesting as cosmic background energy fluctuations and unstable states on minuscule time and spatial scales. These fluctuations appear chaotic and disordered yet possess infinite microscopic structures and potential dynamic changes.</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is an extraordinary phenomenon in quantum mechanics, revealing instant and non-local mutual correlations between particles even when far apart. This phenomenon fundamentally challenges our traditional notions of individuality and separation, suggesting a deeper level of wholeness. On a macroscopic scale, do individual entities also have deep connections akin to quantum entanglement? Such connections stem from biological, social, and even quantum-scale information transmission mechanisms. For instance, the emergence of consciousness, the resonance of emotions, and the formation of collective memory are phenomena beyond individual independence, which can potentially be re-examined through the theoretical framework of quantum entanglement.</p>

            <h3>The Shift from "Measurement" to "Interaction" in Cosmology</h3>
            <p>The "measurement problem" in quantum mechanics challenges the classical notion of separation between observer and observed. Classical physics strictly differentiates between observer and observed, with the observer interacting with the observed system through measuring tools. However, quantum mechanics reveals the limitations of this separation: the interaction between observer and observed is inherently inseparable, and the measurement process is part of the system's evolution.</p>
            <p>Traditionally, the universe is seen as a vast, static existence composed of various substances and energies, following established physical laws. However, the "measurement problem" in quantum mechanics suggests that the universe itself might not just be a static "existence" but a continuous "interaction process." In this interaction view, the different parts of the universe are not isolated entities but systems evolving together through constant interaction and influence.</p>

            <h3>"Quantum Theology": A Cosmological View Beyond Dichotomy</h3>
            <p>A series of paradoxes in quantum physics challenge classical causality and determinism. We can borrow these ideas to construct a "quantum theology" that transcends traditional religious and secular dichotomies. For example, can quantum uncertainty be understood as a "sacred unknowability"? Can quantum superposition be seen as a "potential sacred possibility"?</p>
            <p>Quantum uncertainty can be understood as a "sacred unknowability." In traditional religions, the essence of God or the universe is often considered beyond human understanding. Quantum uncertainty indicates a complexity at the most fundamental physical level that exceeds our cognitive abilities. This unknowability can be seen as a sacred attribute of the universe's essence, revealing that our quest for truth is endless.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>By exploring meaning construction in "quantum foam," the shift from "measurement" to "interaction" in cosmology, and the construction of "quantum theology," we reveal multiple perspectives in quantum cosmology. These perspectives not only challenge traditional cosmological views but also provide a new framework for understanding and constructing the universe. The discoveries of quantum mechanics have profound implications not only in physics but also in philosophy, sociology, and practical technological applications, opening countless doors of possibilities. In the future, we may draw inspiration from quantum entanglement theory to further explore deep connections in the macroscopic world, laying the scientific theoretical foundation for building more inclusive and holistic social structures.</p>
