            <h2>Climate Change and Human Well-being: Knowing Cold and Warmth, and Social Co-construction</h2>
            <p>Extreme weather events brought about by climate change, such as heatwaves, extreme cold, floods, and droughts, are directly threatening human physical and mental health. High temperatures increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, while extreme cold can lead to respiratory diseases. Floods and droughts destroy food and water supplies, leading to malnutrition and disease transmission. However, the impact of climate change on physical and mental health goes far beyond this. Studies have shown that extreme weather events can also cause anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. For example, sudden floods not only destroy homes but also leave indelible shadows in the minds of survivors.</p>
            <p>Climate change not only affects individuals but also social relationships. Extreme weather events exacerbate social inequality, making the poor and vulnerable more susceptible to harm. At the same time, climate change weakens social cohesion. Facing common survival challenges, people need more unity and mutual assistance to collectively build a more climate resilient society. In addition, climate change affects community belonging and cultural identity. Some communities relying on specific climatic conditions, such as fishing villages and agricultural communities, are undergoing the impacts of climate change. The disappearance of culture and the rupture of traditions may weaken people's belonging and identity.</p>

            <h2>Climate Change and Artificial Intelligence: Opportunities and Challenges in the Game</h2>
            <p>Climate change and artificial intelligence, two seemingly independent but closely related issues, are intertwining and influencing each other in an unprecedented way. Artificial intelligence undoubtedly provides new tools and ideas for addressing climate change. In terms of climate prediction, artificial intelligence can process massive climate data, identify patterns and trends that are difficult for humans to detect, thereby improving prediction accuracy and providing more preparation time for disaster prevention and mitigation. In terms of carbon emission monitoring, artificial intelligence can track and accurately monitor carbon emissions by analyzing satellite images, sensor data, and other information, providing data support for the formulation of effective emission reduction policies. Additionally, artificial intelligence can be applied in energy system optimization, green transportation planning, agricultural precision management, and other areas, helping us improve resource utilization efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
            <p>However, artificial intelligence is not flawless. The development and operation of artificial intelligence systems also generate a large amount of carbon emissions, known as "carbon footprint." Training a complex machine learning model requires a lot of electricity and computing resources, and the operation of data centers is a major contributor to carbon emissions. This means that if we do not pay attention to the carbon footprint of artificial intelligence, we may fall into the paradox of "exchanging carbon emissions for emission reduction." Therefore, how to design a low-carbon artificial intelligence system has become a challenge we must face. This requires addressing hardware, software, algorithms, and other aspects, exploring more energy-efficient computing architectures, optimizing algorithm execution efficiency, and enhancing data sharing and reuse rates.</p>

            <h2>Climate Change and Intangible Cultural Heritage: Silent Crisis and the Transmission of Wisdom</h2>
            <p>The impact of climate change is not just cold data and harsh facts; it is also silently eroding the foundation of human cultureâ€”intangible cultural heritage. These generations-old skills, festivals, customs, embody the wisdom of harmonious coexistence between humans and nature, but are facing unprecedented challenges under the threat of climate change.</p>
            <p>The impact of climate change on intangible cultural heritage is multifaceted and often subtle. The disappearance of traditional agriculture, the mutation of festivals, the loss of folk skills, all silently remind us that climate change is eroding the foundation of human culture. For example, climate change leads to frequent extreme weather events, crop failures, and farmers' livelihoods becoming unsustainable. Some cultural heritage relying on specific climatic conditions and traditional agricultural techniques, such as terraced farming and irrigation systems, are gradually disappearing. Similarly, climate change alters the natural environment, some traditional festivals lose their original ritual and sacredness. For example, some festivals relying on specific natural landscapes have to adjust their forms and contents due to the disappearance or mutation of landscapes. In addition, climate change affects the acquisition of raw materials and production processes, some traditional handicrafts are facing survival crises. For example, some crafts relying on specific wood, fabric, minerals as raw materials are having difficulty in passing on the skills due to material shortages or quality degradation.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Climate change is a complex global challenge, while human well-being, artificial intelligence, and intangible cultural heritage are our common pursuits. Connecting these three not only deepens our understanding of the impact of climate change but also inspires the courage and wisdom to actively address climate change. Let us work together to build a better and happier future.</p>
