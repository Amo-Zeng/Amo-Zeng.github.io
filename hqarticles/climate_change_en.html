            <h2>Three Innovative Perspectives on Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Below are three novel perspectives that break conventional frameworks, revealing hidden dimensions of climate issues through interdisciplinary approaches (psychology, geopolitics, ecology):</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>1. The "Temporal Perception Mismatch" of Climate Change: How Human Brains Are Limited by Evolutionary Constraints</h3>
            <p><strong>Core Perspective</strong>: The human brain evolved to respond to immediate threats (like predators) but has cognitive blind spots for slow-building climate crises.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temporal Discounting Effect</strong>: Why do people care more about tomorrow's weather than sea-level rise in 10 years?</li>
                <li><strong>Narrative Reframing</strong>: Could replacing mild terms like "warming" with "climate heart failure" (gradual Earth system collapse) trigger our brain's threat response?</li>
                <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Design "instant feedback systems" (e.g., real-time personal carbon footprint visualization) using gamification to counter procrastination.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>2. Climate Colonialism 2.0: The Power Dynamics of Digital Carbon Footprints</h3>
            <p><strong>Core Perspective</strong>: The hidden inequity in global digital economy's carbon emission allocation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Empires' Carbon Transfer</strong>: Should Amazon/Alibaba Cloud's data center energy consumption be borne by developing nations while emissions are counted toward developed countries?</li>
                <li><strong>Bitcoin Mining's Geographic Shift</strong>: Is the migration of mining operations from China to Kazakhstan environmental progress or carbon leakage?</li>
                <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Propose "digital carbon tariffs" requiring tech giants to allocate emissions responsibility by user geography.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>3. The "Non-Human Perspective" on Climate Adaptation: Evolutionary Mismatch</h3>
            <p><strong>Core Perspective</strong>: Ignoring other species' climate adaptation needs may trigger ecological collapse.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phenological Trap</strong>: Polar bears can't complete hunting before ice melts, yet protection policies still focus solely on emission reduction rather than artificial ice creation.</li>
                <li><strong>Plant Signal Disruption</strong>: Urban light pollution interferes with trees' photoperiod perception, worsening carbon sequestration decline.</li>
                <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Establish a "cross-species climate adaptation fund" incorporating metrics like pollinator efficiency and soil microbial activity into resilience indicators.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>These innovative perspectives are suitable for policy innovation or in-depth reporting. Would you like to explore any direction further?</p>
