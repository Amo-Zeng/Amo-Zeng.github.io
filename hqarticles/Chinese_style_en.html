            <h3>The Rise of New Chinese Style: The Collision and Fusion of Tradition and Modernity</h3>
            <p>New Chinese Style, as an extension and reconstruction of Chinese style in the modern context, is not a simple reproduction of tradition. Instead, it adopts a more rational and contemporary perspective to deconstruct and reconstruct traditional elements, rejuvenating them with new life.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Innovation in Materials and Craftsmanship:</strong> Traditional Chinese furniture is often made of solid wood with intricate carvings,厚重古朴。While the new Chinese style boldly incorporates modern materials such as metal and glass, incorporating simple lines and geometric shapes, preserving the spirit of traditional furniture while giving it a light and fashionable modern feel.</li>
                <li><strong>Innovation in Colors and Patterns:</strong> Traditional Chinese colors are mainly mahogany and black,沉稳庄重。New Chinese style breaks the constraints of traditional colors, integrating bright colors such as the Morandi color scheme and macaron colors, combined with modern minimalist patterns to create a fresher and more elegant living environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Evolution in Space Layout:</strong> Traditional Chinese space layout emphasizes symmetry and balance, highlighting the sense of hierarchy and ceremony in space. New Chinese style pays more attention to the flow and functionality of space, breaking the shackles of traditional layouts to create more open and flexible living spaces.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Chinese Style in the Perspective of Oriental Aesthetics: Spiritual Essence and Modern Interpretation</h3>
            <p>Chinese style is not merely a spatial creation but also a spiritual retreat, a poetic expression of Oriental philosophy and aesthetic taste in modern life.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unity of Heaven and Man: The Spiritual Origin of Chinese Style:</strong> "Unity of Heaven and Man" is the core idea of Oriental philosophy and the spiritual origin of Chinese style. It seeks harmony between people and nature, people and space, emphasizing the unity of architecture and environment, and the connection between space and soul. Chinese style often uses techniques such as borrowed scenery and framed scenery to introduce natural elements into indoor spaces, creating an atmosphere of "A refined room does not need to be large; fragrant flowers do not require many."</li>
                <li><strong>Interplay of Solid and Void: The Aesthetic Purpose of Chinese Style:</strong> "Interplay of Solid and Void" is an important concept in Oriental aesthetics, reflected in Chinese style by the pursuit of spatial layers and意境营造。Chinese style skillfully uses elements such as screens, partitions, and curtains to divide and reorganize space, creating a "connected yet separate" visual effect and a rich sense of spatial layers and flow.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Depth and Craftsmanship: The Cultural Heritage of Chinese Style:</strong> Chinese style is not merely an accumulation of elements but is imbued with profound cultural heritage. It integrates the essence of traditional culture into design, for example, using plum, orchid, bamboo, and chrysanthemum to symbolize noble character, landscapes to convey a love for nature, and calligraphy and poetry to highlight cultural depth, making space a container for承载承载cultural memories.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The revival of Chinese style is not only an awakening of aesthetic consciousness but also a practice of cultural confidence.</p>

This aesthetic awakening is not a blind worship of the past but a conscious recognition of local cultural identity and a rediscovery of its aesthetic value in the context of globalization.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice of Cultural Confidence:</strong> The revival of Chinese style reflects the Chinese people's reassessment and revaluation of their cultural traditions in the context of modernity. From "New Chinese Style" in architectural design to "Chinese Aesthetic" in lifestyle, from "Chinese Style" in cultural products to "Chinese Stories" in international communication, Chinese style is making a loud Chinese voice on the world cultural stage with its unique Oriental charm.</li>
