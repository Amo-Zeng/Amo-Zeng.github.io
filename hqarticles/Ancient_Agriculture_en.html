            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Agriculture, since its inception thousands of years ago, has not only been the foundation of human civilization but also a field of deep cultural and scientific wisdom. Ancient farmers, through generations of observation, experimentation, and adaptation, developed agricultural systems that harmonize with nature. These systems encompass spiritual beliefs, technological innovations, and genetic management — all of which are still relevant and valuable in today’s world facing ecological and sustainability challenges.</p>

            <h3>Religious Beliefs and Agricultural Civilization</h3>
            <p>In many ancient societies, agriculture was not merely a means of subsistence but was deeply intertwined with religion and myth. For instance, in ancient China, people worshipped deities such as the God of Farming (后稷), embodying their reverence for the land and their gratitude for a good harvest. These spiritual symbols served not only religious functions but also had profound social and cultural significance — reinforcing collective identity and promoting harmony between humans and nature through shared rituals and agricultural festivals.</p>

            <h3>Technological Diffusion and Agricultural Development</h3>
            <p>One of the greatest achievements of ancient agricultural societies was the diffusion of technology and knowledge. Whether it was the spread of rice cultivation in Asia or wheat farming in the Fertile Crescent, ancient civilizations continuously exchanged technological advancements through trade routes, migration, and warfare. These innovations — such as iron farming tools, waterwheel irrigation systems, and crop rotation practices — laid the foundation for sustainable agricultural methods still relevant today.</p>

            <h3>Genetic Management and Biodiversity Conservation</h3>
            <p>Long before modern genetics emerged, farmers were already practicing natural selection and crossbreeding to improve crops. In ancient China, for example, farmers cultivated hundreds of rice varieties suited to diverse climates and soil conditions. This early form of genetic management preserved biodiversity and provided a crucial reservoir of genetic resources against pests, diseases, and environmental challenges — a legacy that continues to inspire today’s seed banks and genetic research.</p>

            <h3>Modern Reflections on Ancient Wisdom</h3>
            <p>Although contemporary agriculture heavily relies on science and technology, many of its most promising directions — such as sustainable farming, ecological agriculture, and permaculture — draw inspiration from ancient practices. These methods emphasize living in harmony with nature rather than exploiting it, aligning with the ecological principles that ancient agricultural societies intuitively followed. In tackling modern challenges like climate change, food security, and environmental degradation, we may find critical solutions from these ancestral systems that balanced productivity with ecological and social responsibility.</p>
