        <section>
            <h3>Technical Principles of Quantum Phone</h3>
            <p>The quantum phone utilizes quantum entanglement and quantum key distribution (QKD) and other quantum physics principles to ensure absolute security in communication. Compared to traditional communication methods, quantum phones are almost impossible to eavesdrop on or crack during data transmission.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quantum Entanglement:</strong> A special relationship exists between two or more quantum systems, where a change in the state of one quantum system immediately affects the other, regardless of the distance between them.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantum Key Distribution:</strong> Distributing encryption keys through a quantum channel to ensure the security of the keys.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantum State Transmission:</strong> Utilizing the characteristics of quantum states for information transmission to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the information.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Social Impact of Quantum Phone</h3>
            <p>The application of quantum phones will have a profound impact on future society, affecting multiple fields:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>National Security:</strong> Quantum phones will greatly enhance the security of national communication networks, defending against external attacks.</li>
