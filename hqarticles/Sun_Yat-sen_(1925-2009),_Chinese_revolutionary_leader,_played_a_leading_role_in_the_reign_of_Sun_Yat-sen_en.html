            <h2>Sun Yat-sen: A "World Citizen" in the Context of Globalization and a Pioneer of Political Modernization</h2>
            <p>In the turbulent changes of modern Chinese history, Sun Yat-sen (1866–1925) was not only a forerunner of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution but also a key figure in the foundation of modern Chinese political civilization. His thoughts transcended the boundaries of nation-states, touching the intersection of global politics and civilization; his practices were filled with the brilliance of idealism and the complexity of realpolitik. It is this dual perspective of idealism and pragmatism, local and global, that makes Sun Yat-sen a pivotal figure in China's modernization process.</p>
            <p>He was not only a "Father of the Nation" but also a "World Citizen" with a global vision; he not only sought to overthrow feudal autocracy and establish a republican system but also laid the foundation for China's transition to a modern state through systematic party building and political ideology construction. Despite numerous setbacks in his political career, the value of his thoughts transcends time, continuing to inspire global reflections on ideal societies, international order, and peaceful development.</p>

            <h3>Transcending the Nation-State: From Nationalism to the Idea of a "World Citizen"</h3>
            <p>Sun Yat-sen's nationalism was not merely an emotional national sentiment but was rooted in a profound understanding of global historical trends. His early slogan, "Expel the Manchus, Restore China," reflected the national demands of the initial revolutionary period. However, as he deepened his understanding of the international landscape, his nationalism evolved toward a more open and inclusive "cosmopolitanism."</p>
            <p>Inspired by the "Great Unity" chapter in the Book of Rites, Sun Yat-sen proposed the concept of "World Unity." He argued that China should not isolate itself from the world but take active responsibility in the international community, achieving national rise through peaceful cooperation. This was not only a modern expression of the traditional value of "all under heaven as one" but also an early response to the contemporary civilization's idea of a "community of shared future for mankind."</p>
            <p>Within Asia, Sun Yat-sen closely followed the national liberation movements in places like India and the Philippines, attempting to form the concept of "Asian National Unity." He supported global anti-colonial struggles, opposing the hegemony of Western colonialism, demonstrating the responsibility and human concern of a modern "World Citizen."</p>
            <p>Sun Yat-sen believed that the construction of a nation-state should not mean isolation but an open attitude toward learning from advanced Western systems and integrating global civilization achievements. This thought not only broke away from traditional isolationist thinking but also provided an ideological foundation for China's political modernization.</p>

            <h3>Modern Attempts at Party Politics: Unity of Ideology, Organization, and Image</h3>
            <p>Sun Yat-sen understood that a democratic revolution could not rely solely on force but needed the support of political organization and ideological mobilization. From the Revive China Society and the Tongmenghui to the reorganization of the Kuomintang, he consistently worked to establish a modern party system with a clear ideology, organizational structure, and social mobilization capabilities.</p>
            <p>In this process, he proposed a clear political "branding" strategy. The 16-word motto, "Expel the Manchus, Restore China, Establish a Republic, Equalize Land Rights," was not only a condensed revolutionary goal but also a banner for mass mobilization. The Three Principles of the People—Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood—formed a complete system of revolutionary thought, providing a theoretical foundation for the party's political legitimacy.</p>
            <p>In practice, Sun Yat-sen disseminated the Three Principles of the People through newspapers, speeches, and textbooks, reaching all social strata and building a party image centered on "justice, democracy, and people's livelihood." He also emphasized international communication, attempting to portray the Kuomintang as a modern political force representing "progress, peace, and national self-determination" in the international community.</p>
            <p>Although his party-building journey was fraught with twists and setbacks, these explorations provided a model for the establishment of modern Chinese party organizations and laid an important foundation for political modernization.</p>

            <h3>The Tension Between Idealism and Reality: Political Setbacks and Immortal Thought</h3>
            <p>Despite repeated political setbacks, Sun Yat-sen's thoughts manifested timeless vitality in the tension between idealism and reality. The 1911 Revolution overthrew the Qing Dynasty but did not bring true democratic republicanism; his later reorganization of the Kuomintang and the policy of "Alliance with Russia and Cooperation with the Communists" were not realized during his lifetime. Soon after his death, internal power struggles within the Kuomintang gradually consumed the revolutionary ideals.</p>
            <p>Yet, in this tension, Sun Yat-sen's thoughts showed their enduring relevance. His advocacy of "people's sovereignty" and "democracy" remains inspiring for political reforms in contemporary China; his proposals for socialism and people's livelihood also respond to the widespread demand for fairness and justice in modern society.</p>
            <p>Additionally, his ideas of "World Unity" and peaceful cooperation bear striking similarities to the contemporary concept of a "community of shared future for mankind." It can be said that Sun Yat-sen's thoughts possess significant modernity and global relevance, with his spiritual legacy transcending time and becoming a shared asset for national rejuvenation and world peace.</p>

            <h3>Historical Insights: Responsibility and Accountability in the Era of Globalization</h3>
            <p>In today's era of deepening globalization, Sun Yat-sen's thoughts continue to offer profound practical insights.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Political reform must go hand in hand with intellectual enlightenment:</strong> Without intellectual progress, institutional change is unsustainable. Sun Yat-sen bridged the gap between thought and institution, paving the way for China's modernization.</li>
                <li><strong>Party building should aim for public interest:</strong> Sun Yat-sen emphasized that political parties should represent the interests of "the majority of the people," a concept that remains valuable for contemporary party building.</li>
                <li><strong>National development requires a global perspective:</strong> In a world where the global governance system urgently needs reshaping, Sun Yat-sen's advocacy for "peaceful cooperation" and "common prosperity" provides guidance for China's role as a responsible global power in the midst of global changes.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Conclusion: An Unfinished Prophet</h3>
            <p>Sun Yat-sen never completed the construction of his ideal society in his lifetime, but the seeds of thought he planted have continued to grow in the century-long transformation of China. He was a guide to China's modernization, a participant in global intellectual dialogue, and a visionary of future societal landscapes.</p>
            <p>He did not belong solely to China but to the world.</p>
            <p>In this turbulent and uncertain era, reading Sun Yat-sen again is not just to commemorate a great man but also to respond to his unfinished thoughts: how to build a fair, just, peaceful, and developing world?</p>
