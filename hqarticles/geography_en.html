            <h2>The Transformation of Geography: From Rocks to Virtual Reality</h2>
            <p>Geography, the science exploring the spatial and temporal dimensions of the Earth, is undergoing an unprecedented transformation. From ancient rock records to digital constructs of virtual reality, from sensory bodily experiences to cross-temporal dialogues, the内涵 and外延 of geography are being redefined. This transformation not only changes the way we perceive and experience the Earth but also profoundly influences the relationship between humans and the environment, reshaping our understanding of the essence of space-time.</p>

            <h3>I. The Memory of Rocks and the Dialogue of Ice Cores: Time Travel in Geography</h3>
            <p>Every rock in a geological section is a witness to the history of the Earth. They not only record the 4.6-billion-year evolutionary journey of the Earth but also tell us about the origin and extinction of life, the drift and collision of continents, and the changes and stability of climate through fossils, minerals, and textures.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Paleoclimatology:</strong> By analyzing polar ice cores, the changes in atmospheric composition and periodic fluctuations in climate are interpreted.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep-sea Sediments:</strong> Microfossils reveal historical changes in seawater temperature.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Sensory Geography: Deep Interaction Between Body and Environment</h3>
            <p>Geography is not only about rational data analysis and abstract spatial cognition; it is also a sensory experience, a deep interaction between the body and the environment.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Vision:</strong> Through the colors, shapes, and textures of geographical landscapes, poetic cognition of space is constructed.</li>
                <li><strong>Auditory:</strong> The rhythm of waves crashing on the shore, the echo of wind in valleys, the hustle and bustle of city streets, all form unique "geographical soundscapes."</li>
                <li><strong>Smell and Taste:</strong> The salty scent of sea breeze, the freshness of a forest, the sweetness of a grain of rice, are all crystallizations of human interaction with the environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Touch:</strong> Through touching, stepping, and feeling, we establish deep emotional connections with the geographical environment.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h3>III. Virtual Geography: Spatial Reconstruction in the Digital Revolution</h3>
            <p>With the rise of virtual reality (VR) technology, spatial cognition in geography is undergoing a profound transformation. VR technology breaks the limits of physical space, creating a new kind of spatial experience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hyper-real Space:</strong> Mountains can be moved, rivers can be rerouted, and even entire cities can be reconstructed in virtual space.</li>
                <li><strong>Virtual Social Interaction:</strong> Cross-geographical virtual social interaction is reshaping human social structures and cultural exchange methods.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>IV. The Symphony of Space-Time: The Future Vision of Geography</h3>
            <p>The future of geography will be a multidimensional intertwining of time and space, reality and virtuality, rationality and sensory experience. Through geological time travel, we touch the history of the Earth; through sensory geographical experiences, we establish deep emotional connections with the environment; through the digital revolution of virtual geography, we redefine the concept of space.</p>
