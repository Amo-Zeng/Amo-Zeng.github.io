            <h2>Breaking the Racial Mirror: Identity Reconstruction and Social Inclusion in the Globalized Era</h2>
            <p>Racial issues, as one of the deepest dividing lines in human society, have long profoundly influenced our self-perception, social construction, and economic inequalities. The advancement of globalization has brought unprecedented cultural integration and racial blending, challenging traditional racial concepts. This article will explore, from multiple perspectives including social psychology, economics, and cultural studies, how race reflects complex self-perception and social construction through the "mirror of the other," how the "skin tax" reveals the hidden costs of economic inequality, and how to reconstruct racial concepts in the context of globalization to promote social inclusion and diversity.</p>

            <h3>I. The Mirror of the "Other": Interaction of Race and Self-Perception</h3>
            <p>Race, as one of the core dimensions of the "other" concept, profoundly shapes our cultural concepts, identity, and social interaction patterns through its unique biological and social attributes. Sociologist Henri Tajfel's research indicates that humans have an innate tendency to divide the world into "us" and "them." Racial differences are not only reflected in physical appearance but are deeply rooted in culture, language, customs, and other aspects, making race a powerful "other" label.</p>
            <p>The influence of this "other" label is first reflected in the process of self-perception. Individuals often reinforce their identity by contrasting themselves with the "other." However, this self-perception reflected through the "mirror of the other" not only serves as the foundation of identity but can also become a breeding ground for racial prejudice.</p>

            <h3>II. Racial Stereotypes and the "Skin Tax": The Hidden Cost of Economic Inequality</h3>
            <p>Racial stereotypes are the most common distorted reflections in the "mirror of the other," reducing the complexity of cognition by summarizing complex social phenomena into a few characteristics. For example, white groups are often labeled as "superior," while African groups are stereotyped as "violent" or "lazy." This simplification not only affects individual self-perception but also leads to profound inequalities in the economic sphere.</p>
            <p>The phenomenon of the "skin tax" is a manifestation of the deep connection between race and economic inequality. Historically, colonialism and racist policies provided institutionalized foundations for racial stereotypes; in modern society, systemic discrimination and implicit biases further exacerbate economic inequality.</p>

            <h3>III. The Era of "Mixed Blood": Racial Integration and Identity in the Context of Globalization</h3>
            <p>The wave of globalization has brought increasingly frequent intermarriage and cross-cultural exchanges, with the term "mixed blood" no longer confined to its biological meaning but becoming a cultural phenomenon and social trend. Mixed-race individuals, as products of racial integration, face identity dilemmas. Their physical characteristics, cultural backgrounds, and language habits may differ from those of single-race individuals, leading to confusion and struggle in their identity during their growth.</p>

            <h3>IV. Reconstructing Racial Concepts: From "Either/Or" to "Plural Coexistence"</h3>
            <p>Traditional racial concepts tend to categorize people into different racial groups and distinguish them in an "either/or" manner. This binary thinking not only limits self-perception but also exacerbates racial divides and conflicts. We need to construct a new racial concept, viewing race as a continuous spectrum rather than isolated points.</p>

            <h3>V. Building an Inclusive and Diverse Society: Education, Media, and Cross-Cultural Exchange</h3>
            <p>To break the racial mirror and build a more inclusive and diverse society, we need to address multiple levels. Education, media, and cross-cultural exchange are key avenues.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>VI. Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Racial issues are not only historical challenges but also pressing matters we must confront together in the era of globalization. By breaking the racial mirror, we can not only reconstruct self-perception and social construction but also eliminate the hidden costs of economic inequality, promoting social inclusion and diversity.</p>
