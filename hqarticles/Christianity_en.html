            <h2>Boundaries and Center of Faith: Christian Pluralism and Scientific Integration in the Digital Age</h2>
            <p>In the complex web of modern society, Christianity is not only a symbol of mainstream religion but also a tension-filled and reflective pluralistic belief system. From the perspective of marginalized groups, the history and reality of Christianity reveal a continuous spiritual awakening and struggle; at the intersection of science and faith, Christianity showcases its unique wisdom and adaptability. In the context of the digital age, Christianity faces unprecedented opportunities and challenges. How to maintain the authenticity and depth of faith in this environment becomes an important issue.</p>

            <h3>Christianity from the Perspective of Marginalized Groups</h3>
            <p>Marginalized groups, typically those who are socially, economically, culturally, or religiously marginalized. In the history and reality of Christianity, the existence of these groups is particularly prominent. Christianity is not monolithic internally, its pluralism is reflected in various denominations, branches, and subcultures. However, this diversity also provides space for marginalized groups to voice and struggle.</p>
            <p>The Christian doctrine of "love your neighbor as yourself" and "all are equal before God" contrasts sharply with social injustice and exclusion. The experiences of marginalized groups in Christian communities are often complex and contradictory. On one hand, they may find spiritual sustenance and emotional support in the church; on the other hand, they may also encounter discrimination, exclusion, and even violence.</p>
            <p>Take the LGBTQ+ community as an example, many Christian denominations hold negative attitudes towards homosexuality, even considering it sinful. However, some churches and believers choose to stand with marginalized groups, challenging traditional doctrines and practices through theological reflection and social actions. This internal tension not only changes the face of Christianity but also promotes a rethinking of the essence of faith.</p>

            <h3>The Interaction between Science and Faith</h3>
            <p>Science and faith seem to always be at opposite ends in the long history of humanity. However, as a deep and complex belief system, Christianity shows unique tension and rich connotations in the interaction between science and faith.</p>
            <p>In the history of Christianity, the relationship between science and faith has not been smooth. In the medieval period, the church held the authority of knowledge and education, and scientific exploration was often limited by religious doctrines. However, with the arrival of the Enlightenment, scientific methods were further developed and promoted, and the independence of science gradually strengthened. Darwin's theory of evolution sparked large-scale controversy in the religious community in the 19th century but also prompted some to rethink the relationship between science and faith.</p>
            <p>Christian theologians began to explore how to accept new scientific discoveries while maintaining faith. The dialogue between creationism and evolution has become an important integration path. "Theistic evolution" holds that God created and guided the evolution of life through the process of evolution. This view emphasizes God's role as the Creator while acknowledging the scientific nature of evolution.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the interaction between science and miracles is also an important issue. The essence of science lies in explaining natural phenomena,
