            <h2>From "Self" to "We": The Profound Transformation of Patriotism and the Emergence of Modern Participatory Civic Culture</h2>
            <p>Throughout human history, patriotism has evolved as a collective emotion and ideology, undergoing a profound transformation from "self" to "we." This transformation is not only an emotional evolution but also a reflection of the progress in social organization and spiritual structure. Driven by globalization and technological advancements, the essence and expression of patriotism have continuously evolved, shifting from traditional "grand narratives" to "concrete actions," gradually giving rise to a participatory civic culture.</p>

            <h3>1. The Original Emotion of "Self" and the Initial Formation of the Nation</h3>
            <p>In the early stages of human society, individual identity was primarily rooted in survival and security. During primitive tribal times, personal loyalty was more attached to family and clan. However, with social development, the concept of the nation gradually took shape, and shared language, culture, and religious beliefs provided fertile ground for the emergence of patriotism. At this stage, the concept of "we" expanded beyond narrow families and tribes to a broader ethnic community. Patriotism at this stage was expressed as emotional identification with national symbols and resistance to common enemies.</p>

            <h3>2. The "We" of Modern Nation-States and the Two-Way Interactive Model</h3>
            <p>Entering modern society, the formation of nation-states marked the establishment of patriotism as a universal emotion and ideology. Against the backdrop of globalization and technological progress, the nation became not only a political governing unit but also the core of cultural identity and spiritual belonging. Modern patriotism emphasizes individuals' sense of responsibility and participation towards the nation; civic participation, public service, and cultural heritage have become new forms of expressing patriotism.</p>
            <p>Traditional patriotic education often followed a "one-way output" model, where governments and educational institutions conveyed patriotic ideas to citizens through various channels. However, this model gradually showed its limitations in the context of globalization and informatization. The emerging "two-way interactive" model not only emphasizes active participation of citizens in patriotic education but also promotes patriotism as a dynamic, participatory civic culture.</p>

            <h3>3. From "Grand Narratives" to "Concrete Actions" in Patriotism</h3>
            <p>In everyday life, patriotism manifests as respect and inheritance of the country's culture. Whether it's a traditional folksong on the streets or an ancient book treasured at home, these are small but firm expressions of patriotic sentiment. It also manifests as care for and maintenance of the public environment, from垃圾分类recycling to green commuting, each detail reflecting deep concern for the nation's sustainable future.</p>
            <p>Patriotism in concrete actions emphasizes the cultivation of social responsibility and civic awareness. It encourages people not only to focus on their own interests but also to actively participate in social affairs, contributing to social harmony and progress through volunteer services and public welfare activities. This type of patriotism is no longer an abstract emotional outburst but a specific, actionable code of conduct, serving as a bond between individuals and the nation, citizens and society.</p>

            <h3>4. The Formation of Participatory Civic Culture and Future Prospects</h3>
            <p>The "two-way interactive" model elevates patriotic education to a new level, transforming it into a participatory civic culture. In this culture, patriotism is no longer a passive received idea but the result of citizens' active participation and actions. Through interactive platforms and practical activities, citizens gradually develop a sense of responsibility towards the nation and society, closely integrating personal and national interests.</p>
            <p>This transformation not only drives innovation in patriotic education methods but also promotes patriotism as a participatory civic culture. In the future, with the deepening of interactive models and civic participation, patriotism will influence and shape citizens' behavior and values on a broader scale, injecting lasting momentum into national development and social progress.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Patriotism as an evolution of identity is a continuous process from "self" to "we." In this process, individual emotions and identities continuously expand, from narrow families and tribes to broader nations and ethnic groups, and finally to modern civic communities. This evolution not only reflects changes in the organizational forms of human society but also represents profound progress in human spiritual and emotional structures. Through patriotism, we not only identify with our history and culture but also commit to a shared future and progress. This is the profound significance of modern patriotism.</p>
