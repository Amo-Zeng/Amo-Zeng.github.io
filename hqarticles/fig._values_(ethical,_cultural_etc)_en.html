            <h2>The Evolution and Reconstruction of Value: From Civilizational Contracts to Future Compass</h2>
            <p>In the progression of human civilization, the concept of "value" has evolved from a simple barter system to a currency-based economy, becoming the link connecting individual cognition with societal development. From the simple exchanges of primitive societies to the complex networks of modern societies, value has undergone multiple transformations from material to spiritual, from objective to subjective, and from economic to ethical. Today, with the rapid advancement of technology, particularly the rise of frontier technologies like artificial intelligence and gene editing, the essence and forms of value are undergoing profound reconstruction. This article will explore the origins of value, subjective sedimentation, technological impact, and future visions from four dimensions, examining how value has become the civilizational contract of humanity and how it will guide our direction in future developments.</p>

            <h3>1. The Origins of Value: From Barter to Civilizational Contracts</h3>
            <p>The origins of value can be traced back to the bartering practices of primitive societies. In those times, the core of exchange lay in the use value of goods, and the success of the exchange depended on the matching of mutual needs. However, the limitations of bartering soon became apparent: the needs of both parties had to match precisely, and the value of goods was difficult to quantify. To address this issue, money emerged as a universally accepted medium of exchange, marking a leap in human civilization.</p>
            <p>The introduction of money was not merely a transformation on the economic level but also a catalyst for social division of labor, specialized production, and large-scale cooperation. Through money, value became quantifiable and standardized, greatly facilitating the circulation and trade of goods. Human society evolved from simple tribal economies to complex market economies. Arguably, the monetary system is the primary form of the civilizational contract, as it regulates behaviors, promotes cooperation, and continuously drives the progress of civilization.</p>
            <p>At the same time, value gradually transcended the realm of economic exchange, becoming an important tool for regulating human behavior. Just as computer code directs the operation of the digital world through logic and rules, "value" guides the direction of human society through consensus and norms. This consensus is reflected in various aspects such as law, morality, and culture. It defines what is "valuable" and what is "worth pursuing," thereby shaping societal values and behavioral norms. For example, "integrity" in business, "justice" and "transparency" in politics are all concrete manifestations of value consensus. They not only regulate social behavior but also maintain societal stability and prosperity.</p>

            <h3>2. Subjective Sedimentation of Value: Interweaving of Experience and Cognition</h3>
            <p>Although the monetary system and economic society provide an objective standard for value, the formation process of value is not entirely based on material or economic attributes but is deeply rooted in individual subjective experience and cognition. The subjectivity of value is reflected in the interplay of individual subjective experiences, emotional memories, and cultural backgrounds.</p>
            <p>Firstly, the formation of value is closely related to the individual's cognitive process. Cognitive psychology suggests that an individual's perception of things is the result of the interplay of several psychological processes, including perception, memory, and thinking. In this process, experience plays a crucial role. Experience encompasses not only direct life experiences, such as travel, work, and study, but also indirect learning experiences, such as books, films, and social media. These experiences are internalized in the individual's cognitive process, forming a unique understanding and evaluation of things. For instance, a painting may be priceless to an art enthusiast, while to someone who does not appreciate art, it may be meaningless. This difference does not stem from the inherent attributes of the object but from the individual's subjective experience with the object.</p>
            <p>Emotional memory also plays a significant role in the formation of value. Emotions are an essential component of human cognition, influencing not only our perceptions but also our attitudes and evaluations of things. Emotional memory refers to memories associated with specific emotional experiences, such as pleasant childhood memories or emotional experiences during important moments. These memories often carry strong emotional coloration and serve as a significant basis for our evaluation of things. For example, a person's fondness for a piece of art might stem from a memorable childhood visit to an art gallery with family. This emotional memory not only affects their perception of the artwork but also determines their judgment of its value.</p>
            <p>Cultural background is another critical factor influencing value judgments. Different cultural backgrounds ascribe different meanings and values to things. For example, in Chinese culture, red symbolizes joy and good fortune, while in Western culture, red may be more associated with danger and warning. This cultural background difference directly affects people's value judgments of the same object. From a psychological perspective, cultural background influences cognitive frameworks and value systems, thereby shaping individual value judgments. A cognitive framework is a structured way of thinking that individuals adopt during the cognitive process. It is influenced by cultural background and determines how individuals understand and evaluate things. The value system refers to the evaluation criteria for the importance of things; it is also influenced by cultural background and determines individual value judgments.</p>

            <h3>3. Value Reconstruction Under the Tide of Technology</h3>
            <p>With the rapid advancement of technology, particularly the rise of frontier technologies like artificial intelligence and gene editing, our values are facing unprecedented challenges and reconstruction. These technologies are not just advancements in tools, but deep inquiries into the meaning of human existence and ethical boundaries.</p>
            <p>Firstly, the rise of artificial intelligence poses a multi-dimensional impact on "value." AI applications in fields such as medicine, education, and art make some human activities gradually lose their "uniqueness." For example, should AI-created art be entitled to copyright? The essence of this question lies in how we define the value of "creativity" and "originality." Traditionally, art is seen as a unique expression of human emotions and thoughts, while AI's "creation" is based on data and algorithms, lacking subjective consciousness. However, with the advancement of AI technology, its works are increasingly difficult to distinguish from human creations in terms of aesthetics and innovation. In the face of this phenomenon, we need to rethink the foundation of copyright law - what gives a work its value? Is it the creator's independent thinking, or the work's innovation and aesthetic value?</p>
            <p>Furthermore, gene editing technology poses a deeper challenge to the "value of life." The advent of technologies like CRISPR allows humans to directly modify genes and even design "customized" offspring. The ethical boundaries of this technology have sparked widespread controversy: What genetic modifications are acceptable? Is there such a thing as a "perfect gene"? How to balance technological progress and social equity? The core of these questions is that our respect for life and our belief in the uniqueness of humanity are being redefined by technology. If we can eliminate genetic diseases through technological means, will the value of human life change fundamentally?</p>
            <p>Facing these challenges, constructing a new value system becomes an inevitable choice. Firstly, we need to establish clear boundaries for technology. Technology itself is neutral, but its application must be constrained by ethics and law. For example, in the field of artificial intelligence, clear copyright laws and intellectual property protection mechanisms should be established to ensure the reasonable use of AI technology while protecting the uniqueness of human creativity. In the field of gene editing, a global ethical framework needs to be established to clarify what genetic modifications are acceptable and what should be prohibited.</p>
            <p>Secondly, redefining "humanity" is crucial in constructing a new value system. The development of technology does not mean that humans will be replaced, but rather prompts us to rethink the core meaning of "what it means to be human." For example, creativity, emotional resonance, and moral judgment are unique advantages of humans, and these values should not be diminished by technology. Instead, we should combine these advantages with technology to create a richer and more diverse human civilization.</p>

            <h3>4. The Future Vision of Value: Balancing Technology and Humanity</h3>
            <p>In the future, the construction of a value system will focus more on balance and inclusiveness. We need to find a balance between technological progress and humanistic care, fully leveraging the potential of technology while upholding the bottom line of humanistic spirit. For example, in the field of artificial intelligence, promoting a "human-centered" design philosophy ensures that AI technology serves human welfare rather than replacing the core roles of humans. In the field of gene editing, global ethical consensus must be established to ensure that technological applications advance scientific progress while respecting the dignity and diversity of human life.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the diversification of values will become a significant feature of future society. In the context of globalization, individuals and groups from different cultures and backgrounds will live and collaborate together. This diversity requires us to respect and tolerate different values, avoiding a single value system from dominating society. Through dialogue and communication, we can find a common foundation of values, thereby building a more harmonious and prosperous society.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the evolution and reconstruction of value are significant topics in the progression of human civilization. From bartering to civilizational contracts, from subjective sedimentation to technological impact, value has always been our guiding compass. In the future, through balancing technology and humanity, we will construct a more inclusive and diverse value system, guiding the development of human civilization.</p>
