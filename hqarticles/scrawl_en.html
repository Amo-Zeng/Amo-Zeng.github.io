            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Graffiti, as an art form widely present on urban streets, has traditionally been viewed as illegal or merely visual pollution. However, with the evolution of social culture, graffiti has been redefined not only as street art but also as a window into social psychology, cultural dynamics, urban aesthetics, and ecological impacts. This article aims to explore how graffiti reflects and influences cities and their residents from the perspectives of social psychology, urban aesthetics, and ecology.</p>

            <h3>Graffiti and Urban Social Psychology</h3>
            <p>Graffiti is not just an expression of an artist's personal emotions but also an externalization of the collective unconscious and social emotions of urban residents. According to Jung's theory of the collective unconscious, graffiti can reveal deep-seated social issues such as income inequality, political oppression, cultural identity, and the effects of globalization. For example, in impoverished areas, graffiti often expresses strong critiques of social injustice, reflecting community dissatisfaction with the status quo and a desire for change. Additionally, graffiti serves as a form of silent protest, expressing residents' anxieties about economic instability, political turmoil, and environmental issues. In the context of globalization, graffiti also showcases cultural fusion and conflict, providing a unique perspective on cultural assimilation and preservation.</p>

            <h3>Graffiti and the Reshaping of Urban Aesthetics</h3>
            <p>The contribution of graffiti to urban aesthetics cannot be underestimated. From being initially seen as vandalism, graffiti has gradually become part of the urban landscape and even landmarks. For instance, Hosier Lane in Melbourne and the East Side Gallery in Berlin not only attract global tourists but also enhance the sense of belonging and cultural identity among local residents. Urban managers have successfully incorporated graffiti into city planning through policy-making, artist collaborations, and community engagement. By organizing art festivals and workshops, residents participate in reshaping urban aesthetics, enhancing community cohesion, with graffiti becoming a symbol of urban diversity and innovation.</p>

            <h3>An Ecological Perspective on Graffiti</h3>
            <p>From an ecological standpoint, the choice of materials in graffiti has significant environmental impacts. Traditional paints contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are harmful to air quality and human health. However, with increased environmental awareness, artists are now using water-based, plant-based, and biodegradable paints to reduce pollution. Innovative technologies like UV-curing paints further reduce VOC emissions. Additionally, integrating graffiti with urban greening, like creating art on vertical gardens, not only beautifies the urban landscape but also supports biodiversity. Through these measures, graffiti has transformed from a potential environmental burden into a part of urban ecology, promoting sustainable development.</p>

            <h3>Graffiti as a Tool for Social Resistance and Expression</h3>
            <p>Graffiti is not just art; it's also a challenge to existing social structures. Many artists use their work to express dissatisfaction with laws, morals, and social norms, with the illegality of graffiti itself becoming an act of resistance. During political gatherings or social movements, graffiti is used to convey messages and unite people, driving social change. Through this medium, graffiti not only reflects social issues but actively participates in addressing them.</p>

            <h3>The Role of Graffiti in Global Cultural Exchange</h3>
            <p>Graffiti is not just a local expression but also part of global cultural exchange. Artists from different countries interact, collaborate, and learn from each other, spreading local culture, techniques, and ideas. This intercultural exchange has fostered a global art community and driven the evolution of graffiti art. For example, the Brazilian style of Pixação and American Graffiti mutually influence each other worldwide, creating new art forms and cultural dialogues. Graffiti, as a global language, promotes understanding and respect among different cultures.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Graffiti, as a multidimensional art form, profoundly influences the culture, aesthetics, and ecological environment of cities. It serves as a window into social psychology, reflecting the collective unconscious and reactions to social issues; it reshapes urban aesthetics, enhancing a city's appeal and residents' sense of belonging; and it embodies ecological awareness, promoting the development of eco-friendly materials and technologies. Through comprehensive research and application of graffiti, city managers, artists, and residents can better understand and respond to urban social issues, creating a more harmonious, inclusive, and diverse urban environment. Looking forward, how to continue developing graffiti art while protecting the environment will be a collaborative effort across various sectors. Graffiti is not just an adornment of cities; it embodies the soul of the city, a true reflection of human creativity and the desire to express.</p>
