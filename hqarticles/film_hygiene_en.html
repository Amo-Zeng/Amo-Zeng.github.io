            <h2>Alienation of the Senses and the Predicament of Civilization: Multiple Perspectives in Cinema</h2>
            <p>In the artistic expression of modern cinema, the presentation of the senses intertwines with reflections on civilization, creating a profound dialogue. From the exploration of the "aesthetic of hygiene violence" to the overlooked dimension of the "eye of scent," and the mental shackles of "obsessive cleanliness," these three narrative dimensions together weave a complex picture of modern civilization. Cinema is not just a feast for the eyes and ears but a multi-layered examination of human senses, psyche, and social order.</p>

            <h3>I. Hygiene Violence: Reflection on Civilization Under Destructive Aesthetics</h3>
            <p>In cinema, "hygiene violence" reveals the deep crises of modern civilization through its cold, technical aesthetics. From the liquid metal corrosion of T-1000 in "Terminator 2" to the precise dissection in "Ex Machina," these scenes are not merely displays of violence but metaphors for the supremacy of rationalism in modern society. The precision and destructiveness of medical instruments symbolize the alienation of humanity behind technological development. They are no longer just tools for redemption but reveal the inhuman violence masked by rationality.</p>
            <p>Sickness in cinema is given a dual role: both destruction and rebirth. Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" shows how sickness becomes a tool for disciplining social violence through mandatory psychological treatment; David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" forces audiences to confront the dark side of human nature and fear through extreme visual impact. Sickness is no longer merely a physiological phenomenon but a visual representation of human mental dilemmas, exposing the structural violence in modern society.</p>
            <p>Trauma narratives occupy an important place in modern cinema. The concentration camp scenes in "Son of Saul" and the class metaphors in "Parasite" expand personal trauma into collective memory through "hygiene violence." These works not only depict individual suffering but also reveal the civilizational dilemmas behind such suffering. "Hygiene violence" becomes a unique visual language, forcing audiences to face the truths concealed within modern civilization.</p>

            <h3>II. The Eye of Scent: The Forgotten Sensory Dimension</h3>
            <p>In film narratives, the absence of smell is not a technical limitation but a reflection of the alienation of the modern sensory system. The dominance of visual and auditory elements in cinematic art fragments human sensitivity to the essence of life. Although as early as 1960, French director Georges Franju experimented with "smell movies," this experiment disappeared due to its specificity, which undermined the imaginative space of art. Modern film narratives have formed a coding system centered on vision, making it difficult for smell, as an experience that cannot be accurately reproduced, to integrate into this system.</p>
            <p>However, smell has unique narrative potential. It can create more penetrating memory anchors than vision. In Jiang Wen's "In the Heat of the Sun," Ma Xiaojun's memory of the scent in Milan's room evokes the audience's emotional resonance with adolescence; Tom Tykwer's "Perfume" constructs a more complex urban space through scent, where identity and desire are transformed into multi-layered scent symbols. Smell is not just an emotional trigger but also a regulator of narrative rhythm, as seen in the subtle scent elements in "Before Sunrise," adding more life quality to the dialogue.</p>
            <p>Contemporary filmmakers have begun to reintroduce scent elements. Park Chan-wook's "The Handmaiden" uses essential oil scents to hint at characters' psychological states; Hou Hsiao-hsien's "The Assassin" uses wormwood scent to create historical atmosphere. These attempts prove the narrative potential of smell in modern cinema and provide new possibilities for future sensory aesthetics.</p>

            <h3>III. Obsessive Cleanliness: The Mental Shackles Under Civilization's Garb</h3>
            <p>The "obsessive cleanliness" in cinema mirrors the mental alienation of modern society. From wiping floors to repeated hand-washing, these compulsive behaviors are not just personal habits but a social compulsion. The progress of modern civilization is an endless cleaning movement, with disinfectants, sterile production, and smart homes being ways humans use cleanliness to combat contamination. This obsession with cleanliness stems from the pursuit of order and discipline, such as the mandatory behavioral correction therapy in Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange," a violent form of mental cleaning.</p>
            <p>At the societal level, obsessive cleanliness has become a new form of power discipline. Public sanitation management, censorship on social platforms, and attendance systems in companies all perform invisible "cleaning." This cleaning is not for individual well-being but for maintaining established social order. The management of the psychiatric hospital in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is an extreme manifestation of this social obsession with cleanliness, eliminating all "heterogeneity" with uniform rules.</p>
            <p>Behind the cinematic narratives lies a profound questioning of modernity. Obsessive cleanliness is not a sign of civilization but a manifestation of mental alienation. Those characters repeatedly cleaning on screen are facing the same dilemmas as us: in the endless cycles of cleaning and discipline, are we losing our true selves? Does society's standard of cleanliness, used to discipline individuals, become a form of mental violence? These questions are embodied as metaphors in cinema, provoking deep reflection in the audience.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Dialogue Between Senses and Civilization</h3>
            <p>Cinema, through the lenses of "hygiene violence," "the eye of scent," and "obsessive cleanliness," demonstrates the complex relationship between sensory alienation and the civilizational dilemma. The imbalance of senses and mental alienation are inevitable products of the modern civilizational process. Cinema not only reveals these phenomena but also offers profound reflections on humanity and society. In future cinematic creations, how to balance sensory experiences with narrative depth, and how to re-examine the surface and essence of civilization, will be challenges faced by both creators and audiences. Through this multi-layered examination, cinema provides us with a mirror, allowing us to confront the deep crises hidden beneath the surface of civilization and rethink the relationships between senses, psyche, and society.</p>
