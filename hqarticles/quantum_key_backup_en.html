            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of quantum computing technology, traditional cryptography faces unprecedented challenges. The powerful computing capabilities of quantum computers not only threaten traditional encryption algorithms (such as RSA and ECC) but also pose potential risks to systems relying on cryptographic technology (such as blockchain). In this context, Quantum Key Backup (QKB) technology, with its theoretically unbreakable security, has become a key solution to counter the threat of quantum computing. This article will explore the integration of quantum key backup with traditional cryptography, cloud computing, and blockchain technology, analyze its applications in a multi-dimensional security ecosystem, and look ahead to future development trends.</p>

            <h3>Complementarity of Quantum Key Backup and Traditional Cryptography</h3>
            <p>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is based on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, leveraging the unclonable nature of quantum states and the uncertainty principle of measurements to provide theoretically unconditional security. However, QKD still faces issues such as high equipment costs, limited transmission distances, and poor compatibility in practical applications. Despite the threat posed by quantum computers, traditional cryptography still has significant advantages in terms of efficiency and compatibility. The combination of quantum key backup and traditional cryptography can fully utilize the strengths of both.</p>
