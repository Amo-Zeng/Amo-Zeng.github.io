            <h2>Challenges and Changes in Traditional Education</h2>
            <p>In traditional education systems, the science discipline is often perceived as a rigid and precise edifice, moving forward parallel to other disciplines like humanities and arts. This rigid disciplinary structure not only restricts the flow and integration of knowledge but also stifles students' creativity and curiosity. To cultivate future talents with greater innovative spirit and practical abilities, the education sector urgently requires a profound transformation, calling for the integration of "Science+" interdisciplinary fusion, and the construction of a new, open, diverse, and vibrant education model centered on science.</p>

            <h3>Narrative-Driven Understanding: Infusing Science with Warmth and Soul</h3>
            <p>Firstly, introducing narrative power into science education to infuse formulas and theorems with warmth and soul. By telling compelling scientific stories, integrating knowledge into vivid plots, students become participants rather than passive recipients. For example, when explaining the principles of light refraction, students can be led through a mystical desert, witnessing the magical mirages; when discussing the periodic table, the arduous journey of Marie Curie extracting radium in a humble laboratory can be unfolded. These stories not only stimulate students' curiosity and exploration but also allow them to deeply remember scientific knowledge in awe and emotion. Science fiction provides a broader stage for science education, inspiring imagination through concepts like the Matrix in The Matrix or the astronaut's self-rescue journey in The Martian, and recognizing that science is not just textbook knowledge but a force that changes the world.</p>

            <h3>Experiment Workshops: From Verification to Creation, Unleashing Students' Creativity</h3>
            <p>Traditional scientific experiment models are limited to verifying known theories, easily leading students into the rut of "following the map," which restricts their imagination and creativity. In recent years, experimental teaching is undergoing a transformation from "verification" to "creation." This new perspective encourages students to design experimental schemes independently based on their interests to explore unknown fields. In experiment workshops, students can choose topics like making water purification devices and designing wind power models, which are more interesting and challenging, stimulating their love for science and exploration, and cultivating their innovative spirit and practical abilities. The popularity of open-source hardware and programming platforms provides students with strong technical support, allowing them to build and control scientific devices using platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, experiencing the fun and sense of achievement brought by technology.</p>

            <h3>Interdisciplinary Integration: Breaking Barriers, Constructing a Knowledge Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>"Science+" interdisciplinary integration is not a simple superposition but breaking disciplinary barriers to build an open, inclusive, and interwoven knowledge ecosystem. Science is no longer isolated abstract formulas and theorems but organically combined with disciplines such as art, history, and literature to jointly construct a rich, three-dimensional, and vivid knowledge network. For example, by analyzing the color changes and line rhythms in Van Gogh's The Starry Night, we can deeply understand optical principles and celestial movements; from a historical perspective, examining technological progress, we can understand the role of the scientific revolution in promoting social change; through science fiction, we can deeply explore technological ethical issues and establish correct technological values. This interdisciplinary integration model broadens students' knowledge horizons, cultivates their cross-disciplinary learning abilities, critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovative abilities.</p>

            <h3>Teacher Role Transition: From Transmission to Guidance</h3>
            <p>In the new model, the role of teachers also undergoes profound changes, becoming guides and collaborators in students' exploration. They need to stimulate students' creativity and critical thinking, guide them to discover, think, solve problems, and apply theoretical knowledge to practice, realizing the transition from "verification" to "creation."</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Co-creating an Open, Diverse, and Innovative Education Future</h3>
            <p>"Science+" interdisciplinary integration is not only a transformation of science teaching models but also an update of education philosophy. It emphasizes students' principal role, stimulates creativity and exploration spirit, and cultivates innovative and practical abilities. It is believed that this interdisciplinary integration model centered on science will become the mainstream in science education, co-constructing an open, diverse, and vibrant educational future!</p>
