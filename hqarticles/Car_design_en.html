    <main>
        <section>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Core Thesis:</strong> Driven by the dual waves of intelligence and sustainability, the car has evolved from a "means of transportation" into an <em>interface hub</em> connecting individual psychology, planetary ecology, and human society—its significance transcending mere mobility to become a "neural node" for the self-regulation of technological civilization.
            </blockquote>
            <p>We stand at a critical juncture in technological paradigms: the car is no longer merely a machine of steel and fuel, but a <strong>dynamic medium</strong> embedded with multiple interfaces—it functions as an emotional regulator, a participant in the carbon cycle, and a carrier of fluid identity. At the intersection of digital twins, artificial intelligence, and carbon neutrality goals, the car has become the <strong>convergence point of three major interfaces: psychological, ecological, and social</strong>. Its function no longer ends at "going from A to B," but instead evolves into a <em>platform of continuous negotiation</em> between humans and technology, nature, and one another.</p>
            <p>This transformation echoes Don Ihde's theory of <em>technological embodiment</em>: technology is not external to us, but reshapes our relationship with the world through mediation of perception, action, and meaning (Ihde, 1990). The car exemplifies this <strong>embodied interface</strong>—it is not merely an extension of the body, but of consciousness, emotion, and ethics.</p>
            <p>Yet, as the car becomes a "neural hub," are we prepared for the <strong>tensions of the interface</strong>? When emotions are regulated by algorithms, carbon footprints tracked in real time, and identities reconstructed through data, do we still retain the integrity of the "self"? This article analyzes the three interfaces through cross-case studies, revealing their interconnections, and ultimately proposes <strong>four principles of interface ethics</strong> as a philosophical and institutional framework for governing the mobile society of the future.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Transition:</strong> From the ripple of emotion to the trajectory of carbon flows, from the fluidity of identity to the reconfiguration of society—the car is quietly reshaping our relationships with ourselves, nature, and others through its "trinity" of interface functions.

            <h2>Chapter 1: The Psychological Interface — From Cockpit to "Emotional Regulator"</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Core Thesis:</strong> Smart vehicles, through neurofeedback, emotion recognition, and adaptive interaction, are shifting from "mechanical control" to "emotional empathy," becoming a <em>technological extension</em> of individual emotional regulation—yet also introducing risks of psychological dependency and self-alienation.
            </blockquote>
            <h3>1.1 Theoretical Foundations of Emotional Regulation: From James-Lange to Neurofeedback</h3>
            <p>Traditional driving emphasizes "calmness" and "focus," but modern intelligent cockpits now actively intervene in emotional regulation. The theoretical basis for this shift lies in <strong>emotion regulation theory</strong> (Gross, 1998), where individuals manage emotions through cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression, and other strategies. Smart cars now <strong>technologically mediate</strong> this process, externalizing and automating it.</p>
            <p>For example, Tesla's Model 3 features an <strong>emotion recognition system</strong> that analyzes facial micro-expressions, voice tone, and heart rate variability (HRV) to assess the driver's emotional state in real time. When anxiety is detected, the system automatically plays calming music, adjusts seat massage frequency, or suggests "take five deep breaths" (Tesla, 2022). This exemplifies the car as a <strong>technological emotion regulator</strong>—no longer passively responding to commands, but actively shaping emotional experience.</p>
            <p>Deeper applications emerge from <strong>neurofeedback technology</strong>. BMW's collaboration with NeuroSky on a "focus enhancement system" uses EEG headbands to monitor alpha and beta waves, providing real-time feedback on attention levels. Trials show that drivers using the system reduce reaction time by 18% and error rates by 23% in complex scenarios (BMW Group, 2021). This marks a shift from "passive safety" to "active cognitive enhancement."</p>
            <h3>1.2 Embodiment and Self-Technologies: Foucault's "Technologies of the Self" in a New Arena</h3>
            <p>Foucault (1988) defined "technologies of the self" as practices through which individuals construct their identity. The intelligent cockpit is a contemporary realization of this concept: drivers actively shape their "driving self" by adjusting ambient lighting, scents, music, and other sensory parameters.</p>
            <p>But this process also brings the risk of <strong>self-alienation</strong>. When emotions are "managed" by algorithms, do individuals retain emotional sovereignty? When "focus" is "enhanced" by systems, are we losing control over our cognition? As Ihde warned, technological embodiment expands perception but may also induce an "illusion of transparency"—we mistake technology for a neutral tool, when in fact it is already reshaping our emotional structures and self-perception.</p>
            <h3>1.3 Ethical Dilemmas of Emotional Data: From "Empathy" to "Manipulation"</h3>
            <p>The collection and use of emotional data raise concerns about privacy and manipulation. A survey of 3,000 users found that 62% worry automakers will use emotional data for targeted advertising (Pew Research, 2023). More seriously, the possibility of <strong>emotional manipulation</strong>: if systems can predict and guide emotions, could automakers use "pleasure induction" to prolong driving time and increase service consumption?</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Transition:</strong> As the car becomes the "second brain" of emotion, we must not only assess its regulatory efficacy, but also ask: Who defines "healthy emotion"? Who controls the boundaries of regulation? This question leads us into the deeper tensions of the ecological interface.

            <h2>Chapter 2: The Ecological Interface — From Carbon Source to "Closed Material Flow" Node</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Core Thesis:</strong> The car is shifting from a "carbon source" in a linear economy to an "ecological node" in a circular economy, becoming a key link in closing material flows through battery recycling, carbon capture, and energy sharing.
            </blockquote>
            <h3>2.1 Reconfiguring Industrial Ecology: From "End-of-Pipe" to "Closed-Loop Design"</h3>
            <p>Traditional cars epitomize the linear economy: extract—manufacture—use—discard. Future cars follow the principles of <strong>industrial ecology</strong> (Erkman, 1997), aiming for <em>closed-loop material flows</em>. The core idea: treat waste as a resource, enabling the circulation of materials, energy, and information.</p>
            <p>Take batteries, for instance. CATL's "Battery Bank" model—combining "vehicle-battery separation," "battery leasing," and "cascaded reuse"—extends the lifespan of power batteries to 15 years. Retired batteries are repurposed for energy storage, achieving <strong>energy closure</strong>. Data shows this model reduces the lifetime carbon footprint of each EV by 37% (IEA, 2023).</p>
            <h3>2.2 Carbon Capture and Negative Emissions: The Car as a "Mobile Carbon Sink"</h3>
            <p>More radical innovations come from <strong>onboard direct air capture (DAC)</strong> technology. The "Carbon Capture Roof," developed by Climeworks and Volvo, uses airflow generated during driving to capture CO₂ via adsorbent materials. Tests show a midsize car can capture 2.5 tons of CO₂ annually—equivalent to the sequestration capacity of 100 trees (Climeworks, 2022).</p>
            <p>This technology transforms the car from a "carbon source" into a "carbon sink," enabling <strong>negative emissions</strong>. Its theoretical basis lies at the intersection of <em>geoengineering</em> and <em>ecological modernization</em>: technology is not only a tool for emission reduction, but an active participant in ecological restoration.</p>
            <h3>2.3 Energy Sharing and Distributed Grids: Latour's "Actor-Network" in a New Form</h3>
            <p>Cars are no longer just energy consumers—they are <strong>energy producers</strong>. Through V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) technology, EVs can charge during off-peak hours and feed power back into the grid during peak demand. A pilot in California showed that 1,000 EVs can form a "virtual power plant" capable of meeting emergency power needs for a mid-sized town (NREL, 2023).</p>
            <p>This model aligns with Latour's (2005) <em>Actor-Network Theory (ANT)</em>: cars, grids, users, and policies form a dynamic network, where non-human actors (e.g., batteries, algorithms) also possess "agency." The car is no longer an isolated vehicle, but an <strong>actor within an energy network</strong>.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Transition:</strong> As the car becomes a node in ecological closure, its value is no longer measured solely by mileage, but by the sustainability of "carbon flows" and "energy flows." This shift forces us to rethink: should identity and rights in the social interface be redefined alongside ecological roles?
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Chapter 3: The Social Interface — From Private Space to "Liquid Identity" Platform</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Core Thesis:</strong> Shared mobility, autonomous driving, and data identity make the car a carrier of "liquid identity," where individuals frequently switch between roles—"driver," "passenger," "data subject"—challenging traditional social roles and rights.
            </blockquote>
            <h3>3.1 Liquid Modernity and Identity Fluidity: Bauman's Contemporary Echo</h3>
            <p>Bauman's (2000) theory of <em>liquid modernity</em> describes how identities in contemporary society are no longer fixed, but fluid across contexts. Shared mobility (e.g., DiDi, Uber) exemplifies this trend: users are simultaneously "car owners" (owning vehicles), "passengers" (using services), and "data providers" (contributing behavioral data).</p>
            <p>A survey of 5,000 shared mobility users in Beijing found that 78% feel "more free to express themselves in cars," while 65% report adjusting their behavior when switching between platforms (Tsinghua University, 2022). This shows that the car has become a new arena for <strong>identity performance</strong>.</p>
            <h3>3.2 The Social Significance of Anonymous Mobility: From "Visibility" to "Invisibility"</h3>
            <p>The rise of autonomous driving further promotes <strong>anonymous mobility</strong>. When AI drives, passengers no longer need to expose driving behavior, and their social roles are "de-labeled." A survey across 10 European countries found that 61% support "fully anonymous mobility," believing it reduces traffic discrimination (e.g., against new or female drivers) (Eurobarometer, 2023).</p>
            <p>But anonymity also brings regulatory challenges. When accidents occur, how is responsibility assigned? When data is misused, how is accountability enforced? This demands <strong>dynamic identity authentication mechanisms</strong> that balance privacy and safety.</p>
            <h3>3.3 Data Identity and Rights Reconfiguration: From "Ownership" to "Use"</h3>
            <p>In the data-driven era, the car becomes a generator of <strong>data identity</strong>. Every trip, every interaction, builds a digital profile. But the critical questions remain: <strong>Who owns this data? Who has the right to use it?</strong></p>
            <p>The EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA, 2022) grants users the right to access and transfer their mobility data, prohibiting automakers from monopolizing it. This marks a shift from "data ownership" to "data sovereignty." In the future, we may see the rise of <strong>data cooperatives</strong>: user collectives managing mobility data and earning revenue through authorized use.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Transition:</strong> As identity flows and rights reconfigure, the car is no longer just a mobile container, but a "protocol of social relations." The ethical foundation of this protocol demands urgent reflection.

            <h2>Chapter 4: Cross-Case Analysis — Coupling and Conflict Across the Three Interfaces</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Core Thesis:</strong> Through three case studies, we reveal that the psychological, ecological, and social interfaces are not isolated, but deeply coupled and mutually constraining—their synergies and conflicts expose the deep tensions of future mobile society.
            </blockquote>
            <h3>Case 1: The Emotional-Ecological-Social Triangle of Autonomous Taxis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Psychological</strong>: Passengers feel anxious during autonomous driving; the system mitigates this by playing music and adjusting lighting (emotion regulator);</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological</strong>: The vehicle uses hydrogen energy, achieving zero emissions (closed material flow);</li>
                <li><strong>Social</strong>: Passengers enjoy anonymity, but platforms still build behavioral profiles, raising privacy concerns.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Conflict</strong>: Emotion regulation relies on data collection, which threatens anonymity. <strong>Solution</strong>: Use "differential privacy" to preserve emotional regulation while obfuscating identity.</p>
            <h3>Case 2: The "Ecological Paradox" of Electric Off-Roaders</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Psychological</strong>: Users seek the thrill of "conquering nature"; the system enhances this via terrain simulation;</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological</strong>: The vehicle uses recyclable materials, but off-roading damages ecosystems;</li>
                <li><strong>Social</strong>: Users showcase "eco-offroading" on social media, performing "greenness."</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Conflict</strong>: Psychological satisfaction conflicts with ecological responsibility. <strong>Solution</strong>: Introduce an "ecological credit" system—users must offset carbon or perform ecological services to gain off-road access.</p>
            <h3>Case 3: "Interface Exclusion" of Elderly Users</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Psychological</strong>: Older users face cognitive load from smart systems; emotion regulation functions may increase anxiety;</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological</strong>: EV charging is inconvenient, reducing usage;</li>
                <li><strong>Social</strong>: Shared mobility algorithms favor younger users, marginalizing the elderly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Conflict</strong>: Technology lacks inclusivity. <strong>Solution</strong>: Design "age-friendly interfaces" with simplified interactions; establish a "digital inclusion fund" to subsidize elderly users.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Transition:</strong> These cases show that optimizing a single interface cannot solve systemic issues. Only through a unified ethical framework can we achieve interface synergy.

                <strong>Core Thesis:</strong> In response to the complex interplay of the three interfaces, we must build a framework of <em>interface ethics</em>—four principles to address the challenges of technology, ecology, and society in concert.
            </blockquote>
            <h3>The Problem: Four Risks of Interface Control</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Psychological Dependency</strong>: Emotion regulation systems may erode individual emotional autonomy;</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Paradox</strong>: Green technologies used for unsustainable behaviors;</li>
                <li><strong>Social Exclusion</strong>: Algorithms exacerbating inequality;</li>
                <li><strong>Data Monopoly</strong>: Platforms controlling data, depriving users of sovereignty.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Response: Interdisciplinary Ethical Dialogue</h3>
            <ul>

                <li>With <strong>Latour</strong>: The car is an "actor," but humans must retain "agency";</li>
                <li>With <strong>Ihde</strong>: Technological embodiment should promote "transparency," not "transparency illusions";</li>

            <h2>Conclusion: Reimagining the "Human" in Motion</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Core Thesis:</strong> The future of the car is not merely technological evolution, but a deepening of human self-understanding—through the entanglement of psychological, ecological, and social interfaces, we will ultimately realize: true "mobility" is the ongoing reconfiguration of our relationship with the world.
            </blockquote>
            <p>From emotional regulation to closed carbon cycles, from fluid identity to social inclusion, the car has become a <strong>reflective medium</strong> of technological civilization. It reminds us: every journey is a dialogue between self and world; every ignition is an ethical choice.</p>
            <p>The future does not belong to the most powerful technology, but to the most <strong>self-reflective</strong> one. As wheels turn, we should not only care about speed, but about direction—the direction that points toward <strong>more complete humans</strong>, a more sustainable Earth, and a more just society.</p>
            <p>In motion, we will ultimately understand: <strong>the interface is not the destination, but the beginning; mobility is not the goal, but the process; and the human remains the navigator of this journey</strong>.</p>
