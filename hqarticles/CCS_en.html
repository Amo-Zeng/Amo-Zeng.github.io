            <h2>Global Climate Change and Carbon Neutrality Goals</h2>
            <p>Global climate change has become a major challenge for human society, and countries are accelerating efforts to achieve carbon neutrality. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, as an important means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, has been continuously evolving and upgrading in recent years. From traditional CCS to value-added CCS+, distributed CCS for regional applications, and negative carbon CCS technologies aimed at achieving negative carbon emissions, a diverse technology matrix has been formed to drive the realization of carbon neutrality goals. However, the limitations of a single technology path are obvious. Only by deeply integrating these technology paths and building a synergistic and complementary technological ecosystem can we truly achieve a leap from carbon reduction to carbon removal, opening up a path to a sustainable future.</p>

            <h3>CCS+: Transforming Carbon Dioxide from Waste to Resource</h3>
            <p>Traditional CCS technology focuses on capturing carbon dioxide and storing it underground to prevent it from entering the atmosphere, but its high costs and reliance on geological conditions limit its large-scale application. CCS+ technology treats captured carbon dioxide as a usable resource, giving it a new lifecycle and achieving a win-win situation for economic and environmental benefits. The core of CCS+ lies in building a closed-loop ecosystem of "capture-utilization-storage." Its application scenarios cover three major directions: industrial, energy transition, and material innovation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Industrial Applications:</strong> Carbon dioxide is already widely used in food and beverage, construction, and agriculture, such as as a raw material for carbonated drinks, a concrete curing agent, and a fertilizer production ingredient. By capturing carbon dioxide emitted during industrial production and using it in these fields, we can not only reduce reliance on fossil fuels but also lower production costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Transition:</strong> Through chemical conversion technologies, carbon dioxide can be transformed into synthetic fuels (such as methanol and gasoline) and green hydrogen, providing clean energy for transportation and energy supply and promoting global energy structure transformation.</li>
                <li><strong>New Materials:</strong> Carbon dioxide can also be used to produce biodegradable plastics and high-performance carbon fibers, offering new solutions to traditional plastic pollution and driving the development of advanced manufacturing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, the development of CCS+ technology still faces challenges such as technical maturity, cost optimization, and public awareness, requiring joint efforts from policy support, technological innovation, and market promotion.</p>

            <h3>Distributed CCS: A Breakthrough for Regional Energy Transition and Carbon Neutrality</h3>
            <p>Traditional CCS technology is largely centralized around major emission sources and is difficult to adapt to regional energy transition needs. Distributed CCS technology addresses this by miniaturizing and modularizing carbon capture devices and deploying them flexibly according to regional characteristics, providing a new solution for regional energy transition. Its advantages lie in localized, customized deployment and the creation of diverse application scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Industrial Parks:</strong> Distributed CCS can achieve on-site capture, utilization, or storage of carbon dioxide within industrial parks, such as for chemical product production or enhanced oil recovery in oil fields, reducing carbon emissions and creating economic benefits.</li>
                <li><strong>Urban Communities:</strong> In urban communities, distributed CCS can be integrated with waste and wastewater treatment facilities to build urban carbon sink systems, reducing urban carbon emissions and improving the ecological environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Remote Areas:</strong> Utilizing natural geological conditions such as abandoned mines and saline aquifers, distributed CCS can implement regional carbon storage projects in remote areas, achieving long-term and secure carbon storage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The promotion of distributed CCS technology still needs to overcome issues such as high initial investment and insufficient technical maturity. However, its potential to lower investment thresholds, increase project returns, and promote technological iteration makes it an important tool for driving regional carbon neutrality.</p>

            <h3>Negative Carbon CCS: A Leap from Carbon Reduction to Carbon Removal</h3>
            <p>Although CCS and CCS+ technologies can reduce carbon dioxide emissions to some extent, the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere still needs to be removed through negative carbon technologies. Negative carbon CCS technology provides a key pathway to true carbon neutrality by directly capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and permanently storing it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Weathering:</strong> Using natural minerals to react with carbon dioxide to form stable carbonates, thereby removing it from the atmosphere.</li>
                <li><strong>Direct Air Capture:</strong> Capturing carbon dioxide directly from the air through chemical or physical methods and storing it underground or under the sea.</li>
                <li><strong>Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS):</strong> Utilizing biomass energy for power generation or heating while capturing and storing carbon dioxide, achieving negative carbon emissions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although negative carbon technologies have enormous potential, their development still faces challenges such as technical maturity, high costs, and public acceptance. To achieve large-scale application of negative carbon technologies, it is necessary to strengthen technological research and development, improve policy support, and promote market mechanism construction.</p>

            <h3>Synergistic Innovation: Building a Diverse Carbon Neutrality Technology Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>CCS+, distributed CCS, and negative carbon CCS technologies each have their own focus, but a single technology path is insufficient to meet the complex needs of global carbon neutrality. Only by deeply integrating these technologies to build a synergistic and complementary technological ecosystem can we achieve a leap from carbon reduction to carbon removal:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technological Complementarity:</strong> CCS+ focuses on the resource utilization of carbon dioxide, distributed CCS emphasizes regional deployment, and negative carbon technologies focus on removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The coordinated application of these three can achieve full-chain coverage of carbon capture, utilization, storage, and removal.</li>
                <li><strong>Scenario Synergy:</strong> In industrial parks, urban communities, and remote areas, CCS+, distributed CCS, and negative carbon technologies can be combined and applied according to local conditions, building diverse carbon neutrality solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Policy and Market Coordination:</strong> Governments need to formulate incentive policies to reduce technology application costs and promote the improvement of carbon pricing mechanisms, creating conditions for the market application of negative carbon technologies.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>CCS+, distributed CCS, and negative carbon CCS technologies together form a technology matrix for addressing climate change. Only through technological synergy, policy support, and market promotion can we achieve a leap from carbon reduction to carbon removal and provide strong technical support for the realization of global carbon neutrality goals. In the future, as these technologies continue to mature and be promoted, humanity is expected to build a cleaner and more sustainable green future.</p>
