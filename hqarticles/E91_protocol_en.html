            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the rapid surge of information technology, data security and communication confidentiality have become global focal points. Quantum communication, an emerging technology, offers innovative solutions to the risks faced by traditional encryption methods through its unique mechanisms based on quantum mechanics. The E91 protocol, also known as the Ekert protocol, was proposed by Artur Ekert in 1991 as a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol. It cleverly utilizes the properties of quantum entanglement to ensure communication security, hailed as a cornerstone in the field of quantum communication.</p>

            <h3>Security Foundation of the E91 Protocol</h3>
            <p>The core of the E91 protocol lies in utilizing the properties of quantum entanglement to achieve secure key distribution. Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more particles are interconnected in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the state of the others. In the E91 protocol, the sender (Alice) and receiver (Bob) share a pair of entangled quantum bits (qubits, such as photons). Alice and Bob each measure their qubits and record the measurement results and bases. Due to the properties of quantum entanglement, there is a statistical correlation between Alice and Bob's measurement results, even if they may choose different measurement bases.</p>
            <p>The security of the E91 protocol is based on the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics, which states that an unknown quantum state cannot be accurately copied. If an eavesdropper (Eve) tries to intercept and copy the qubits, the properties of quantum entanglement will cause Eve's measurement to interfere with the original entangled state. Thus, Alice and Bob can detect the eavesdropping by comparing their measurement results. This unconditional security is unparalleled by traditional encryption methods.</p>

            <h3>Practical Applications and Challenges of the E91 Protocol</h3>
            <p>Although the E91 protocol is theoretically secure, it faces some challenges in practical applications. The transmission of qubits may be affected by noise and quantum decoherence, which could degrade the quality of entanglement and impact the security of key distribution. Additionally, the preparation and measurement of qubits require highly precise equipment, which poses technical difficulties and costs.</p>
            <p>However, with the continuous advancement of quantum technology, the E91 protocol has been validated in some experimental networks. For example, researchers have successfully implemented long-distance quantum key distribution in laboratory environments, using entangled photon pairs to transmit quantum information over dozens of kilometers of fiber. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the E91 protocol in practical communication networks.</p>

            <h3>Comparison Between the E91 Protocol and Classical Communication Protocols</h3>
            <p>In terms of security and performance, the E91 protocol differs significantly from classical communication protocols. The core advantage of the E91 protocol lies in its unconditional security based on quantum mechanics principles, where any eavesdropping activity will be immediately detected. In contrast, classical communication protocols (such as RSA and AES) rely on mathematical problems and computational complexity to ensure security, which may be vulnerable to quantum computing attacks.</p>
            <p>In terms of performance, the E91 protocol still faces some technical challenges in the preparation, transmission, and measurement of qubits, which may affect its performance in practical networks. However, with the continuous advancement of quantum technology, new qubit encoding methods and quantum error correction techniques can improve the efficiency and reliability of quantum communication, bringing the performance of the E91 protocol closer to that of classical communication protocols.</p>

            <h3>Future Outlook</h3>
            <p>As a foundational technology for quantum key distribution, the E91 protocol is poised to build more secure quantum communication networks in the future. With the development of quantum computers, traditional encryption methods may face risks of being cracked. The E91 protocol offers a secure communication method based on quantum mechanics principles, effectively resisting quantum computing attacks. Therefore, the E91 protocol is expected to find wider applications in areas such as financial and data security, secure quantum internet, and more.</p>
            <p>Although the E91 protocol still faces some technical and engineering challenges in practical applications, its theoretical security and potential make it an important research direction in the future quantum communication field. With the continuous development and maturity of quantum technology, the E91 protocol is expected to play a greater role in quantum communication networks, laying the foundation for building a more secure network environment.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The E91 protocol, with its unique properties of quantum entanglement and unconditional security, provides a powerful safety assurance for quantum key distribution. Despite the challenges in practical applications, with the advancement of quantum technology, the E91 protocol is expected to play a greater role in the future, laying the foundation for building more secure quantum communication networks and quantum security applications.</p>
