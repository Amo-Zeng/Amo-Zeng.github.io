            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In today's digital age, privacy protection has become a critical issue. Quantum encryption technology, particularly the E91 protocol, with its unique principle of quantum entanglement, offers unprecedented security for communication. As technology advances and its applications expand, the E91 protocol not only shows immense potential in privacy protection but also heralds a revolution in future cybersecurity frameworks through integration with other advanced technologies. Meanwhile, technological progress also raises a series of complex ethical and moral issues, compelling us to ponder the direction of future information security.</p>

            <h2>Overview of the E91 Protocol</h2>
            <p>The E91 protocol was proposed by Artur Ekert in 1991, utilizing quantum entanglement for key distribution. Its core steps include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Generation of Entangled Photon Pairs</strong>: A source generates entangled photon pairs, sending them to both communicating parties, Alice and Bob.</li>
                <li><strong>Choice of Measurement Bases</strong>: Both parties randomly choose measurement bases to measure their respective photons.</li>
                <li><strong>Comparison of Results and Key Extraction</strong>: After exchanging some measurement basis information via classical channels, they confirm no eavesdropping and extract the shared key.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This method ensures absolute security in communication, as any eavesdropping attempt would disrupt the quantum entanglement state, making it immediately detectable.</p>

            <h3>Privacy and Ethical Issues</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Absolute Privacy and Criminal Activities</strong></p>
            <p>The privacy provided by the E91 protocol, while protecting personal communication security, could also be exploited by criminals to hide illegal activities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Concealing Crimes</strong>: How to protect personal privacy while preventing it from becoming a tool for crime?</li>
                <li><strong>Law Enforcement Challenges</strong>: Traditional investigative methods might fail against such high encryption, how to balance law enforcement needs with privacy protection?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. National Security vs. Information Transparency</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Threat to National Security</strong>: Absolute privacy might lead to leaks of national security information, how to ensure national security without infringing on personal privacy?</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency Issues</strong>: In a democratic society, information transparency is key to government accountability, the use of the E91 protocol could weaken this transparency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>3. Technological Development and Ethical Responsibility</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technology Misuse</strong>: The high cost of quantum encryption might exacerbate the digital divide, how to prevent such inequality?</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Responsibility</strong>: Developers should consider the potential ethical consequences when promoting technology and take on corresponding social responsibilities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The E91 protocol not only theoretically achieves absolute communication security, but its integration with other technologies also heralds a new era in cybersecurity. However, such technological advancement also poses a series of ethical and moral challenges. We need to address these through legislation, technological restrictions, public education, and other means to ensure that quantum encryption technology, while protecting privacy, does not become a tool for crime or injustice. The fusion of technology and ethics will be an unavoidable topic of the information age, with quantum entanglement playing an increasingly central role in future technological development.</p>
