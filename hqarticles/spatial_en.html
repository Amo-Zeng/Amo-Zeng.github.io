                <h2>Introduction: Deconstructing and Redefining Space</h2>
                <p>We live in an era where the concept of space is being fundamentally reconstructed. The steel and concrete of the physical world, the code flows of the virtual world, and the neural synapses of consciousness together weave a multidimensional web of existence. These three spaces—digital virtual space, urban physical space, and brain consciousness space—are not isolated islands but dynamic systems that permeate and shape each other. Through an interdisciplinary lens, this article reveals how space becomes a battlefield for power struggles, a stage for identity performance, and a laboratory for self-construction.</p>

                <h3>First Movement: Digital Virtual Space—The Carnival and Traps of Fluid Identity</h3>
                <p>In the mirrored world of the metaverse, identity becomes programmable text. Multiple social media accounts, role-playing in games, and the anthropomorphic personalities of AI chatbots all deconstruct the stability of traditional identity. This "Digital Dissociation" exhibits duality:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Liberating Aspect</strong>: Marginalized groups use virtual avatars to break free from real-world constraints of race, gender, or class, such as transgender individuals exploring gender identity in anonymous communities;</li>
                    <li><strong>Alienating Aspect</strong>: When individuals experience cognitive conflict between their TikTok performance persona and LinkedIn professional persona, they fall into what philosopher Scheler called "value personhood" confusion.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Notably, digital identity is not entirely a matter of autonomous choice. Platform algorithms subtly shape our virtual personas through "Behavioral Design"—Instagram's like mechanism cultivates performative personalities, while Twitter's anger propagation model reinforces oppositional identities. This reveals a harsh reality: the free performance in virtual space is still framed by the power structures of digital capitalism.</p>

                <h3>Second Movement: Urban Physical Space—The Material Inscription of Power Geometry</h3>
                <p>Cities are the most exquisite topological presentation of power. Haussmann's Paris renovation and Le Corbusier's Radiant City plan are essentially about producing social order through spatial order. In contemporary China's urbanization process, this power logic manifests as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Spatial Gentrification</strong>: The "cultural preservation technique" in Beijing's hutong renovations transforms living spaces into consumption landscapes;</li>
                    <li><strong>Surveillance Urbanism</strong>: Shenzhen's "smart city" camera networks and health code systems constitute a digital upgrade of Foucault's "disciplinary society."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Yet the resistance poetics of citizens never disappear. Chongqing's "Bangbang Army" measures urban crevices with their carrying poles, while Shanghai alley residents create satirical graffiti on demolition walls. These "Weapons of the Weak" carve out what de Certeau called "tactical spaces" in the cracks between capital and power. When we insist on taking a familiar alley instead of following Gaode Map's navigation route, we engage in micro-scale spatial resistance.</p>

                <h3>Third Movement: Brain Consciousness Space—The Inner Frontier of Neurophenomenology</h3>
                <p>Neuroscientist Kandel discovered that when mice run in mazes, their hippocampal neurons form spatial mappings called "place cells." Human consciousness similarly constructs "Cognitive Mapping," but more complexly:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Perceptual Layer</strong>: VR technology reconstructs spatial perception by deceiving the visual cortex, proving the brain's spatial interpretation is plastic;</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory Layer</strong>: London taxi drivers' enlarged hippocampi confirm that spatial memory can alter brain structure;</li>
                    <li><strong>Metaphorical Layer</strong>: We often use spatial metaphors like "labyrinth of thought" or "frontiers of knowledge" to organize thinking, suggesting consciousness itself is spatial.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This Neuroplasticity resonates remarkably with digital and urban spaces: Douyin's fragmented information flows reshape attention allocation, while CBD glass facades' visual pressure alters stress hormone levels. The three spaces collude at the neural level, forming what French philosopher Stiegler called the "Technological Unconscious."</p>

                <h3>Finale: Future Implications of the Three-Body Problem of Space</h3>
                <p>In the entanglement of triple spaces, we are both prisoners and architects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The fluidity of <strong>digital identity</strong> may dissolve real-world ethics of responsibility but also provides experimental grounds for cross-cultural understanding;</li>
                    <li>The violence of <strong>urban renewal</strong> requires "Participatory Design" as counterbalance, like Barcelona's "superblocks" plan returning street rights to residents;</li>
                    <li>The development of <strong>brain-computer interfaces</strong> may enable direct dialogue between consciousness space and digital space, raising new ethical challenges of Neurorights.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>French philosopher Lefebvre predicted in The Production of Space: "Every society produces its own space." In this era of tri-space folding, what we need is not just technological iteration but a revolution in spatial cognition paradigms—expanding spatial justice from a geographical concept to an integrated framework of digital rights and neural ethics. Only then can we safeguard the spatial existence of what makes us human amid algorithmic discipline, capitalist colonization, and conscious alienation.</p>
