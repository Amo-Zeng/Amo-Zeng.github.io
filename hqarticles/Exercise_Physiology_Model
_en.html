请将以下内容翻译成英文：

The term "数甲" typically refers to "Mathematics Category A" (abbreviated as "数甲"), commonly seen in educational or examination classifications, such as in the university entrance exams in Taiwan (e.g., the Learning Ability Test or Subject Competency Test). Mathematics is divided into two categories — 数甲 and 数乙 — differing in difficulty and scope:

1. **Mathematics Category A (数甲)**: Covers more advanced mathematical theory and applications. It is generally designed for students applying to science, technology, engineering, or mathematics-related departments.
2. **Mathematics Category B (数乙)**: Covers more basic mathematical concepts and is suited for students applying to humanities, law, business, or other fields that require less mathematical proficiency.

If you need further clarification or assistance, please provide additional context:
- Which region's curriculum or exam system are you referring to?
- Is it a math problem you need help solving or an explanation of the exam content?
- Do you have specific questions or topics you'd like to discuss?
