            <h2>The Duet of Art: Cross-Boundary Integration and Empathy Experience of Literature and Theater</h2>
            <p>Literature and theater, these two ancient art forms, have woven a symphony of human emotions through different media and expression methods since time immemorial. When words leap onto the stage, when the audience meets the characters in the theater, a resonance across time and space quietly emerges. This resonance is not merely an emotional resonance but also a deeper level of intellectual exchange. In the process of cross-media art creation and reception, the integration of literature and theater not only expands the narrative space but also provides the audience with multi-dimensional artistic experiences, profoundly affecting the generation and dissemination of empathy mechanisms.</p>

            <h3>I. From Flat to Three-Dimensional: Textual Staging and the Expansion of Narrative Space</h3>
            <p>The transition of literary works from pages to the stage is an artistic migration from flat to three-dimensional. Words flow quietly on the pages, while the stage breathes life and power into these words, elevating them from flat narration to a three-dimensional sensory experience. This migration is not just a transformation of form but also a profound deconstruction and re-creation of art.</p>
            <p>Firstly, textual staging is a feast for the senses. The abstract mental space constructed by literary works through words is concretized into a three-dimensional reality scene by the visual, auditory, and tactile elements of the stage. For example, Shakespeare's "Hamlet" uses the castle on the stage, court dances, and the appearance of ghosts to transform the words on the pages into intuitive visual symbols, instantly immersing the audience in the complex atmosphere of the Danish royal court. This concretization not only enriches the narrative's expressive power but also allows the audience to more directly feel the emotional tension of the work.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the staging process is a secondary creation of the text. The portrayal of literary dialogue on the stage is not a simple replication but requires careful condensation and reconstruction. Each line of dialogue on the stage must fulfill multiple functions: conveying emotions, driving the plot, and coordinating with stage actions. This condensation process makes the dialogue more concise and powerful, while also making the emotional expression of the characters more direct. For instance, in Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard," the rhythm of the dialogue and the coordination with stage movements make seemingly ordinary conversations filled with dramatic tension, enhancing the audience's understanding of the characters' inner worlds.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the performance of actors plays a crucial role in the staging process. The characters in literary works are intangible, existing within the imagination of readers, while actors give these characters physical form through their bodies, voices, and expressions. For example, in Shakespeare's "King Lear," Lear's emotional transformation from arrogance to collapse relies entirely on the actor's body language and facial expressions, a burst of emotion that mere words cannot achieve.</p>
            <p>However, staging is not merely a victorious extension of literature; it also has its limitations. The physical space of the stage is limited, and the linear flow of time cannot jump as freely as in literary works. Therefore, staging must adapt the original work by making choices and modifications to suit stage performance needs. These choices sometimes weaken the complexity of the original work but may also bring new interpretative spaces to the piece. For example, while Tolstoy's "War and Peace" is difficult to fully present on stage, focusing on specific scenes in the stage version of "War and Peace" can highlight certain emotions and social issues in the original text that were overlooked.</p>

            <h3>II. The Breakthrough of Narrative Space: From Single Dimension to Multi-Sensory Integration</h3>
            <p>The cross-boundary integration of literature and theater is not only reflected in the transformation of forms but also in the expansion of narrative space. Traditional literary narratives rely on the linear unfolding of words, where readers construct fictional worlds in their minds through reading. However, the power of words is always limited by flat expression, and although it can inspire readers' imagination, it cannot fully restore the intensity of emotions and the authenticity of senses. The theater, through the combination of visual, auditory, and tactile senses, concretizes the narrative space in literary works from the abstract mental world into a three-dimensional reality scene.</p>
            <p>Take Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" as an example. This play, hailed as the pinnacle of "absurdist theater," reveals the absurdity and meaninglessness of human existence through two tramps waiting aimlessly in the wilderness. In the literary text, this sense of absurdity is primarily expressed through symbolic language, while in the theater, the director can directly present this absurdity to the audience through lighting, set design, and bodily movements. For instance, the emptiness of the wilderness can be reflected through minimalist stage design, and the tramps' pointless waiting can be reinforced through meaningless dialogue and repetitive actions. This multi-sensory expression allows the audience to more directly experience the emotional tension of the work, rather than simply imagining it through words.</p>
            <p>This expansion of narrative space is not merely a reproduction of literary content but also a reinterpretation of its meaning. The theater, through formal innovation, breathes new life into literary works. For example, director Peter Brook, in staging "Waiting for Godot," designed the stage as an empty circular space, simplifying the actors' movements and dialogues to the extreme, even omitting some lines. This extreme formalism forces the audience to actively participate in the construction of the narrative, thereby deepening their understanding of the work's absurd themes.</p>

            <h3>III. Cross-Media Study of Empathy Experience: From Imagination to Resonance</h3>
            <p>In the cross-media study of literature and theater, empathy experience becomes an important link connecting different art forms. Empathy is a complex emotional process involving multiple dimensions such as cognition, emotion, and imagination. In literary works, empathy is primarily achieved through the emotional depiction of words and the advancement of the plot. Readers imagine themselves in the characters' situations, experiencing the emotional fluctuations of the characters. In theater, empathy is achieved through more direct means. The actors' performances, stage settings, and lighting all work together to allow the audience to more directly feel the characters' emotions.</p>
            <p>For example, in Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet," readers feel the depth of Romeo and Juliet's love and the bitterness of their fate through words, creating a strong emotional resonance. In the stage version of "Romeo and Juliet," actors' passionate dialogues and scenes of life and death directly touch the audience's emotional nerve, creating profound empathy with the characters.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the immediacy of theater is also an important factor in empathy. The reading of literary works is a relatively slow process, during which readers have enough time to think and imagine. The performance of theater is immediate; the audience must feel the characters' emotions in a short time, which intensifies the strength of empathy. For instance, in Ibsen's "A Doll's House," Nora's "exit" action is completed instantly on stage, and this sudden emotional outburst immediately creates empathy between the audience and the character.</p>

            <h3>IV. Empathy and Social Culture: The Significance of Cross-Media Transmission</h3>
            <p>Empathy is not only an individual emotional experience but also an important way of social and cultural transmission. Through the cross-media transmission of literature and theater, empathy experiences transcend individual perceptions and become shared emotional resources in society. For example, in war-themed works, whether literary or theatrical, they can evoke the audience's reflection on war through the emotional experiences of the characters. In Sholokhov's "And Quiet Flows the Don," the literature depicts the destruction of war on human nature through words, while the stage version of "And Quiet Flows the Don" concretizes this destruction through actors' performances, allowing the audience to more deeply feel the cruelty of war. This empathy experience not only enhances the social critique of the work but also promotes society's attention to war issues.</p>

            <h3>V. Conclusion: Infinite Possibilities of Narrative Space and the Future of Empathy</h3>
            <p>The cross-boundary integration of literature and theater is not only a breakthrough in traditional narrative forms but also a redefinition of narrative space. Through the combination of multi-sensory elements, the introduction of non-linear narratives, and the reshaping of audience experience, the theater gives literary works new life, while also providing the audience with richer and more diverse artistic experiences.</p>
            <p>In the future, with technological progress and the diversification of audience needs, the cross-boundary integration of literature and theater will present even richer and more diverse forms. Whether through virtual reality technology to enhance the audience's immersion or through interactive theater to break the boundaries between the audience and the actors, the expansion of narrative space will continue to provide new inspiration and possibilities for artistic creation.</p>
            <p>In this ever-changing art world, the cross-boundary integration of literature and theater will continue to bring new surprises and inspiration to the audience. Whether it is classical literary works or avant-garde experimental theater, they are collectively exploring a question: What is the boundary of narrative space? And the answer might lie in every dialogue between the audience and the work.</p>
