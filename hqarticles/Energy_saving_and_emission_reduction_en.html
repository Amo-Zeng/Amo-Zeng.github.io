         <h3>Unique Ethical Risks of AGI</h3>
         <p>Unlike traditional AI, AGI has cross-domain autonomous decision-making capabilities, which may lead to:
             <ul>
                 <li>Risk of goal misalignment: How can we ensure AGI behavior aligns with human values?</li>
                 <li>Potential for data misuse: AGI's reliance on large-scale data could exacerbate privacy breaches.</li>
                 <li>Unclear responsibility attribution: How do we define the responsibility of developers versus the machine in case of system errors?</li>
             </ul>

<h2>Ethical Challenges in AGI Development: Data Privacy and Security</h2>
<section>
    <h3>Overview of AGI Ethical Issues</h3>
    <p>The emergence of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has sparked unprecedented ethical debates. Key challenges include:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Control problem:</strong> How can we design safety mechanisms to prevent AGI from deviating from human intentions?</li>
            <li><strong>Data bias:</strong> Unfairness in training data may influence AGI decision-making.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy threats:</strong> The demand for large-scale data may lead to the misuse of user information.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Possible Solution Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Explainable AI (XAI):</strong> Increase the transparency of AGI decisions to enable better oversight and auditing.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy-preserving computation:</strong> Use techniques like federated learning and homomorphic encryption to protect user data.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical framework development:</strong> Collaborate with technologists and ethicists to establish global ethical guidelines.</li>
    </ol>

### ðŸ“Œ Additional Notes
1. **Language Switching Functionality Needs Improvement**  
   - The current `<button id="languageToggle">` lacks JavaScript logic (e.g., to switch between language versions).
2. **SEO Optimization**  
   - Add Open Graph tags inside the `<head>` for better social media previews:
     ```html
     <meta property="og:title" content="Ethics and Data Privacy in AGI - 2AGI.me">
     <meta property="og:description" content="Exploring value alignment, privacy protection, and global governance in the development of Artificial General Intelligence">
