            <h2>Triple Dimensional Analysis in Educational History</h2>
            <p>This study reconstructs a framework for analyzing educational history through the “power-body-space” triple dimension. By combining theoretical critique with empirical analysis, it reveals the interaction mechanism between educational practices and social structures. The breakthroughs are reflected in the following three aspects:</p>

            <h3>1. Dimension of Power: Deconstructing Disciplinary Knowledge Production</h3>
            <p>Using Foucault's concept of "regimes of truth," cases such as Owenist community schools and the transformation of the education system in East Germany are placed within a broader genealogy of power discourse. This reveals how educational practices respond to colonial governance by shifting from "cultural homogenization" to a dual nature of "cultural instrumentalization." Through recovering marginalized experiences such as Brazilian adult literacy programs and bilingual education policy, the study deconstructs the "success narratives" prevalent in traditional educational history. This critical perspective transcends linear institutional histories, shifting toward micro-analyses of the topology of educational power.</p>

            <h3>2. Technocratic Governance: The Material Trajectory of Bodily Discipline</h3>
            <p>This research innovatively introduces the philosophy of technology into the sociology of the body, constructing a material genealogy ranging from the rod (pre-modern violent discipline) to smart bracelets (digital soft control). Of particular note is the reinterpretation of school uniforms—not only as carriers of symbolic discipline, but also as tools for standardizing the space of the body through fabric materials and sewing techniques. Through a comparative analysis of etiquette rules in Ming Dynasty China and contemporary wearable devices, the study highlights the cultural differences in how different civilizations construct the "disciplinary body," opening new pathways for cross-cultural educational comparisons.</p>

            <h3>3. Spatial Politics: The Ghost Geography of Educational Places</h3>
            <p>The research adopts Deleuze’s concept of "rhizome" to re-examine educational space. By juxtaposing East German school buildings in Berlin, temporary classrooms in South Africa, and MOOC virtual spaces, it reveals how educational places function simultaneously as material carriers of historical memory and topological fields of political struggle. The case of the “Public Library Movement” in Kerala, India, illustrates that the struggle over knowledge spaces is, in essence, a process of re-encoding collective memory. This spatial turn goes beyond the traditional materialist approach of educational architectural history, shifting focus to how places shape and reshape collective identity.</p>
