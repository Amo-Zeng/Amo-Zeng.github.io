            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Biogeography is the science that studies the distribution of life on Earth and the ecological processes involved, forming an important intersection with ecology and geography in the context of global change. Climate change, species adaptation strategies, and human activities together shape today's biogeographical patterns. This article will explore their combined effects on biogeographical distribution, species survival, and ecosystem functions from these three perspectives, and propose response strategies.</p>

            <h3>Impact of Climate Change on Biogeographical Distribution</h3>
            <h4>Species Migration and Distribution Patterns</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Polar and Alpine Species</strong>: With global warming, species in polar and alpine regions face severe survival challenges. Polar bears and certain alpine plants are seeking new habitats to adapt to rapidly changing temperatures. The migration direction is often towards colder areas to maintain their original ecological niche.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecosystem Reorganization</strong>: Species migration not only changes their own distribution patterns but can also trigger chain reactions in ecosystems. For example, migrating species might alter food web structures, leading to niche overlap and intensified competition.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Ecosystem Stability and Extinction Risk</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduction in Biodiversity</strong>: Species migration and extinction simplify ecosystems, reducing biodiversity. Ecosystems with lower diversity are more vulnerable to invasive species and environmental changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Decline in Ecosystem Service Functions</strong>: If climate change alters wetland ecosystems, their flood buffering capacity, water purification functions, etc., might be negatively affected.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Climate change, species adaptation, and human activities shape biogeographical patterns. These factors not only affect species distribution and survival but also have profound impacts on ecosystem stability and functionality. Through comprehensive response strategies, these impacts can be mitigated, promoting ecosystem adaptation and recovery. Biogeographical research provides scientific basis for understanding and responding to these changes, guiding future conservation and management strategies. Future research should continue to explore the interactions of these factors to more effectively protect Earth's biodiversity and ecosystem functions.</p>
