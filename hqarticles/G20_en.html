            <h2>The Great Transformation of the World and the Dual Mission of the G20</h2>
            <p>The world is undergoing a great transformation unseen in a century, with the rapid development of the digital economy and the severe challenges of climate change intertwining. The competition between globalization and deglobalization is intense, and the geopolitical landscape is rapidly evolving. In this context, the G20, as the core platform for global economic governance, shoulders the dual mission of leading the formulation of digital economy rules and promoting green recovery, becoming a key force in reshaping the new global governance landscape.</p>

            <h3>I. Digital Economy Competition: The Power and Responsibility of Tech Giants</h3>
            <p>The rapid rise of the digital economy has pushed tech giants from幕后 to台前, making them an undeniable force on the G20 stage. They control vast amounts of data, advanced technologies, and large user bases, becoming the "infrastructure" providers in the digital economy era. However, the rise of tech giants has also sparked global digital economy competitions involving the pursuit of multiple interests.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Competition and Cooperation Among Tech Giants:</strong> Major tech giants are fiercely competing for market share and dominance in key technology fields such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. At the same time, facing global challenges such as climate change and pandemic response, they also need to cooperate in technological innovation and application.</li>
                <li><strong>The Game Between Tech Giants and Governments:</strong> As the power of tech giants continues to grow, government calls for regulation and constraints are also increasing. Issues such as data security, privacy protection, and anti-monopoly have become the focus of the game between tech giants and governments. Governments aim to set rules to constrain the power of tech giants, maintain market fair competition, and safeguard social public interests.</li>
                <li><strong>Interest Disparities Between Developed and Developing Countries:</strong> Developed countries, with their advanced digital infrastructure and technological advantages, hope to establish global unified digital economy rules to consolidate their dominant positions. Developing countries, on the other hand, aim to gain more voice in the digital economy development and promote a more equitable and inclusive digital economy order.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Climate Change and Energy Transition: Global Consensus on Green Recovery</h3>
            <p>Global climate change has become one of the most severe challenges faced by humanity, with frequent extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and deteriorating ecosystems threatening human survival and development. Energy, as the main source of greenhouse gas emissions, has become the core issue of global climate action. The G20, as the representative of the world's major economies, plays a pivotal role in addressing climate change and promoting energy transition.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Policy Guidance and Technological Innovation:</strong> The G20 sets and publishes roadmaps, guidelines, and best practices for climate actions and energy transition, providing policy guidance and action frameworks for countries. At the same time, G20 member countries possess global leading scientific research capabilities, promoting energy technological innovation and cost reduction through strengthening clean energy technology research, promotion, and application, accelerating the process of energy transition.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Support and International Cooperation:</strong> The G20 establishes green funds and provides concessional loans to developing and emerging economies, helping them overcome technical and financial barriers to achieve energy transition and green development. At the same time, the G20 builds international cooperation platforms to promote technical exchanges, experience sharing, and project cooperation among member countries and with non-member countries, jointly addressing climate change challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Opportunities for Green Recovery:</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity for countries to reflect on economic development models and promote green recovery. The G20 integrates climate actions into economic recovery plans, promotes green finance development, and guides capital flow to environmental protection, energy conservation, and low-carbon fields, providing financial support for green recovery.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>III. The Unique Advantages of the G20 and the Construction of the New Global Governance Landscape</h3>
            <p>The unique advantage of the G20 lies in its membership covering major developed and developing countries worldwide, with extensive representativeness. This broad representativeness enables the G20 to reflect global interests more comprehensively and address global challenges more inclusively.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Promoting Global Economic Governance Reform:</strong> Facing the trend of multipolarity, the G20 should actively promote the reform of the governance structure of international financial institutions, increasing the representation and voice of emerging market and developing countries. At the same time, the G20 strengthens coordination and cooperation with other international organizations to build a more open, inclusive, balanced, and beneficial global economic governance system.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening Cooperation Among Developing Countries:</strong> Developing countries are an important driving force for the trend of multipolarity. The G20 should increase its attention and support for developing countries, promote South-South cooperation and North-South dialogue, narrow the development gap, and achieve common development.</li>
                <li><strong>Addressing Global Challenges:</strong> Issues such as climate change, pandemics, and food security are global challenges that require joint efforts from all countries. The G20 should play a leading role in promoting global consensus on these issues and formulating practical action plans.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting Inclusive Growth:</strong> In the context of multipolarity, countries' interests are more diverse. The G20 should focus on balancing various interests and promoting inclusive growth, ensuring that development outcomes benefit people of all countries more fairly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>IV. China's Role and Contribution in the G20</h3>
            <p>As an important member of the G20, China has always adhered to the global governance concept of consultation, contribution, and shared benefits, actively participating in the agenda setting and rule-making of the G20, contributing Chinese wisdom and solutions to the reform and construction of the global governance system. China's proposals such as the Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, and the Global Security Initiative provide important platforms and paths for promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind and improving the global governance system.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The transformation of the global governance system is an inevitable trend of historical development. The G20, as an important platform for global economic governance, bears the important mission of leading reform and promoting the construction of a fairer and more reasonable new global governance landscape. Facing the dual challenges of digital economy competition and climate change, G20 countries should strengthen solidarity and cooperation, adhere to the principles of consultation, contribution, and shared benefits, and strive to promote the global governance system towards a fairer and more reasonable direction, contributing to the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. The dual mission of the digital economy and green recovery is both the historical responsibility of the G20 and the key path to leading the new global governance landscape.</p>
