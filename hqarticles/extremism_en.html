            <p>The普及 of social media provides an unprecedented platform for the spread of extremism. Algorithms recommend information based on users' preferences, trapping people in "echo chambers" that reinforce existing biases, allowing extremist views to ferment within "small circles" and eventually break boundaries to influence broader populations. The "echo chamber" effect makes it increasingly difficult for people to encounter differing viewpoints...</p>
