            <h2>The Dual Philosophical Dimensions of Live Streaming</h2>
            <p>As an emerging media form, live streaming has not only brought technological changes but also sparked profound reflections at philosophical and sociological levels. Below is an analysis of the dual philosophical dimensions of live streaming phenomena:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reconstruction at the Ontological Level:</strong> Sartre's "existence precedes essence" finds dynamic extension in the construction of streamer identities, where each live session becomes an iterative experiment in self-definition, with algorithm recommendations and audience feedback serving as real-time shaping forces. Heidegger's concept of "being-with" undergoes digital transformation, as viewers construct virtual presence through comment symbols, forming technologically mediated emotional communities.</li>
                <li><strong>Epistemological Challenges and Innovations:</strong> Phenomenology's "return to things themselves" encounters media alienation, where the "reality" presented in live streaming is essentially performative reality encoded through technology. Habermas's communicative rationality faces dimensional reduction, as tipping mechanisms deconstruct the ideal state of rational discourse while giving rise to a new dialogic logic where "traffic equals power."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Critical Observation Framework</h3>
            <p>In-depth analysis of live streaming phenomena requires a critical observation framework. Below are key dimensions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Agency of Technological Objects:</strong> From Actor-network theory perspective, live streaming platforms as actors execute the guiding function of a "digital Socrates" through their recommendation algorithms, yet distort the open nature of dialogue.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantified Emotional Transactions:</strong> The emotional currency system composed of heart symbols and virtual gifts is redefining the economic model of intimate relationships. Does this transactional expression erode emotional authenticity?</li>
                <li><strong>Illusion of Free Will:</strong> The seemingly open interactive interface actually presets strict rule frameworks, where the real-time revelry of comments cannot conceal their programmed dance within algorithmic tracks. Is this freedom Kant's "governed freedom"?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Philosophical Shifts in Practical Approaches</h3>
            <p>In live streaming practice, philosophical shifts offer new pathways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Dimension Elevation for Streamers:</strong> Transforming performance anxiety into Mises's "entrepreneurial spirit" - dynamically adjusting audience expectations and self-expression. Constructing Deleuze's "rhizomatic" cognitive networks: discovering implicit knowledge structures within fragmented feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Critical Engagement for Viewers:</strong> Developing Adorno's "dialectical image" viewing method: transcending symbolic consumption to capture negative forces within visuals. Practicing Benjamin's reevaluation of aura in the age of mechanical reproduction: locating particles of authenticity within digital flows.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Future Research Directions</h3>
            <p>Future research could explore the following directions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bergson's "duration" theory and the reconstruction of spatiotemporal relationships in live streaming media.</li>
                <li>Wittgenstein's language games and the rewriting of rules in cross-platform multimodal interactions.</li>
                <li>New variations of Western Marxist cultural industry critique within the live streaming economy.</li>
            </ul>
