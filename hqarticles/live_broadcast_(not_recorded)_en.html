            <h2>Dual Philosophical Dimensions of the Live Streaming Phenomenon</h2>
            <h3>Reconstruction at the Ontological Level</h3>
            <p>Sartre's "Existence precedes essence" dynamically extends to the construction of the host's identity: each live stream becomes an iterative experiment in self-definition, with algorithmic recommendations and audience feedback forming real-time shaping forces.</p>
            <p>The digital transformation of Heidegger's concept of "Being-with": viewers construct a sense of virtual presence through bullet screen symbols, forming a technologically mediated emotional community.</p>
            
            <h3>Challenges and Innovations in Epistemology</h3>
            <p>The phenomenological "return to the things themselves" encounters media alienation: the "reality" displayed in live streams is essentially a performative reality encoded by technology.</p>
            <p>Habermas's communicative rationality faces the threat of dimensionality reduction: the tipping mechanism deconstructs the ideal state of rational discourse but gives rise to a new dialogue logic where "traffic equals power."</p>

            <h2>Critical Observation Framework</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Agency of Technological Objects: </strong>From the perspective of Actor-network theory, live streaming platforms as actors execute the guiding function of the "Digital Socrates" through their recommendation algorithms, yet distort the open nature of dialogue.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantification of Emotional Transactions: </strong>The emotional currency system composed of heart symbols and virtual gifts is redefining the economic model of intimate relationships. Does this transactional expression erode emotional authenticity?</li>
                <li><strong>Illusion of Free Will: </strong>The seemingly open interactive interface is preset with strict rule frameworks. The immediate revelry of bullet screens cannot hide their programmed dance on the algorithmic racetrack. Is this freedom Kant's "governed freedom?"</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h2>Philosophical Shift in Practical Paths</h2>
            <h3>Cognitive Ascension of Hosts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Transforming performance anxiety into Mises's "entrepreneurial spirit" â€“ dynamically adjusting audience expectations and self-expression</li>
                <li>Constructing Deleuze's "rhizomatic" cognitive network: discovering latent knowledge structures in fragmented feedback</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Critical Engagement of Viewers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Developing Adorno's "dialectical image" approach to viewing: transcending symbolic consumption to capture the negative power within the imagery</li>
                <li>Practicing Benjamin's reevaluation of aura in the age of mechanical reproduction: locating the particles of truth within digital flows</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Future Research Directions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bergson's theory of "duration" and the reconstruction of temporal and spatial relations in live streaming media</li>
                <li>Wittgenstein's language games and the rewriting of rules in cross-platform multimodal interactions</li>
                <li>New variations of Western Marxist critiques of the culture industry within the live streaming economy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Examining the live streaming phenomenon within a philosophical framework not only reveals the cognitive dilemmas of digital existence but also points to the dialectical tension between technological alienation and subjectivity reconstruction. Future live streaming practices may need to carve out new spaces for meaning production between Heidegger's question concerning technology and Deleuze's generative thinking.</p>
