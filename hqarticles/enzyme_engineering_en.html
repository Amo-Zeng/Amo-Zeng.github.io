            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As an important branch of biotechnology, enzyme engineering has shown great application potential in various fields in recent years. Enzymes, as biological catalysts, are characterized by their high efficiency, specificity, and environmental friendliness, which can significantly improve production efficiency and product quality. With the increasing global awareness of sustainable development and environmental protection, the role of enzyme engineering in "green chemistry" has become increasingly prominent. At the same time, the application of enzyme engineering in precision medicine also shows great potential, providing patients with more personalized and efficient medical solutions. This article will explore the current status, application prospects, and future challenges of enzyme engineering in green chemistry and precision medicine.</p>

            <h2>Applications in Green Chemistry</h2>
            <h3>1. Reducing By-products and Waste in Chemical Reactions</h3>
            <p>The application of enzyme engineering in "green chemistry" mainly focuses on reducing by-products and waste in chemical reactions, and lowering energy consumption. Through enzyme catalysis, more efficient and environmentally friendly chemical reaction processes can be achieved, reducing environmental pollution.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pharmaceutical Industry:</strong> The application of enzyme engineering in drug synthesis and biopharmaceuticals has significantly improved production efficiency and environmental friendliness. For example, the use of enzyme-catalyzed synthesis of antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs not only improves production efficiency but also reduces the use of chemical reagents and waste generation.</li>
                <li><strong>Food Industry:</strong> Enzyme engineering plays a significant role in food processing and preservation. Through enzyme catalysis, the nutritional value of food can be improved, shelf life extended, and food waste reduced. Additionally, enzyme engineering is used to produce low-calorie, low-fat healthy foods, meeting consumers' demand for healthy diets.</li>
                <li><strong>Textile Industry:</strong> Enzyme engineering is used in the textile industry for fiber treatment and dyeing, significantly reducing the use of chemical reagents and wastewater discharge. Traditional textile processes often require large amounts of chemical reagents, causing severe environmental pollution. Through enzyme catalysis, more environmentally friendly fiber treatment and dyeing can be achieved.</li>
                <li><strong>Paper Industry:</strong> The application of enzyme engineering in the paper industry mainly focuses on pulp bleaching and wastewater treatment. Through enzyme catalysis, more environmentally friendly pulp bleaching can be achieved, reducing the use of chlorine and lowering the content of harmful substances in wastewater.</li>
                <li><strong>Biofuels:</strong> Enzyme engineering also plays a significant role in the production of biofuels. For example, the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose to produce bioethanol can effectively utilize agricultural and forestry waste, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Innovations</h3>
            <p>In recent years, with the development of synthetic biology, scientists have begun to design and construct enzymes with new functions, providing new ideas for solving environmental problems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enzymes for Plastic Degradation:</strong> Plastic pollution is a major environmental issue globally. Scientists have designed enzymes capable of degrading plastics through genetic engineering. These enzymes can break down plastics in the natural environment, reducing the accumulation of plastic waste and providing new solutions to the problem of plastic pollution.</li>
                <li><strong>High-efficiency Enzyme Catalysts:</strong> Through synthetic biology techniques, scientists can design enzymes with higher catalytic efficiency. These enzymes can operate at lower temperatures and pressures, further reducing energy consumption and improving production efficiency. For example, genetically engineered enzymes can be used to produce more environmentally friendly detergents, reducing environmental pollution.</li>
                <li><strong>Multipurpose Enzyme Systems:</strong> Scientists are working on constructing multipurpose enzyme systems to achieve synergistic effects among multiple enzymes. Such multipurpose enzyme systems can complete multiple catalytic steps in a single reaction system, further improving reaction efficiency and reducing by-product generation.</li>

            <h2>Applications in Precision Medicine</h2>
            <h3>1. Applications in Gene Therapy</h3>
            <p>Gene therapy is one of the important areas of precision medicine, where the goal is to treat genetic diseases by repairing or replacing defective genes. The application of enzyme engineering in gene therapy mainly involves designing and modifying specific enzymes to enable them to specifically recognize and cut disease-causing genes. For example, the Cas9 enzyme in the CRISPR-Cas9 system is an efficient gene editing tool that can precisely cut target genes by designing specific guide RNAs (gRNAs). Furthermore, through enzyme engineering modifications, the specificity and efficiency of Cas9 enzymes can be further improved, reducing off-target effects and enhancing the safety and effectiveness of gene therapy.</p>
            <h3>2. Development of Biosensors</h3>
            <p>Enzyme engineering also shows great potential in the development of biosensors. Biosensors are devices that can convert biological signals into measurable signals. Enzymes, due to their high specificity and catalytic efficiency, are ideal components for biosensors. For example, enzymes can be used to detect specific biomarkers in blood or other biological samples, providing rapid and accurate diagnostic information. Additionally, through enzyme engineering, the sensitivity and stability of biosensors can be improved, making them more suitable for clinical applications.</p>
