            <h3>1. Bio-Based Plastics: The Future of Sustainable Packaging and Manufacturing</h3>
            <h4>Definition and Main Types</h4>
            <p>Bio-based plastics are plastics produced from biological materials like plants and microorganisms. The main types include Polylactic Acid (PLA), Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), Bio-Polyethylene (Bio-PE), and Polybutylene Succinate (PBS). These materials not only reduce dependency on petroleum resources but are also biodegradable, aligning with the principles of a circular economy.</p>
            
            <h4>Application Cases</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Packaging Industry:</strong> PLA and PHA, due to their biodegradability, are widely used in food packaging, courier packaging, and other fields, reducing environmental pollution from traditional plastics.</li>
                <li><strong>Automotive Manufacturing:</strong> The use of bio-based composite materials not only lightens the vehicle body but also reduces carbon emissions during production.</li>
                <li><strong>Textile Industry:</strong> PLA fibers are used to manufacture eco-friendly clothing, offering a sustainable alternative and reducing reliance on traditional polyester fibers.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Field:</strong> PHA's strong biocompatibility makes it suitable for implants and drug delivery systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Biodegradable plastic films used in agriculture reduce plastic residue pollution in fields.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Production Costs and Technical Challenges</h4>
            <p>Despite the many advantages of bio-based plastics, their production costs are still high, primarily due to raw material costs and energy consumption in production. Technical challenges include the stability of raw materials, production efficiency, optimization of product performance, and the feasibility of recycling and degradation.</p>

            <h4>Market Prospects and Development Trends</h4>
            <p>With the increase in environmental awareness, the demand for bio-based plastics is expected to continue growing. Market research indicates that by 2025, the bio-based plastics market size will reach approximately $4 billion. Future trends will include technological innovation to reduce costs, diversification of applications, promoting circular economy models, and international collaboration.</p>
