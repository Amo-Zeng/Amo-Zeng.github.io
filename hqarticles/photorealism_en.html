            <h3>From Reality Reshaping to Cultural Struggle</h3>
            <p>In the history of art, the use of light and shadow can be traced back to the Renaissance period. Artists used light and shadow to reshape the real world, making their works more three-dimensional and realistic. Over time, light and shadow became more than just tools for depicting reality; they gradually turned into symbols of cultural struggle. In many social movements of the 20th century, light and shadow were used to convey ideas, evoke emotions, and became a powerful means of cultural expression.</p>
