                <p>Intelligent vehicles, as products of the integration between artificial intelligence and machine vision technologies, are undergoing a profound transformation from "autonomous machines" to "digital citizens in transportation society" and "mobile space units." This revolution not only pushes technological boundaries but also fundamentally challenges and reshapes humanity's traditional understanding of transportation, space, time, and even social structures.</p>

                <h3>I. From "Tool" to "Collaborator": The Identity Transformation of Intelligent Vehicles</h3>
                <p>In traditional transportation systems, vehicles have always been extensions of human will, their behavior entirely dependent on driver control. The emergence of intelligent vehicles breaks this linear relationship, transforming them from "passive executors" to "active participants."</p>
                <p>The concept of "digital citizens" originally refers to entities that operate independently within digital systems, follow system rules, and participate in resource allocation and governance. The operational logic of intelligent vehicles aligns perfectly with this definition: they perceive their environment in real-time through sensors, plan routes based on traffic rules, achieve resource allocation through multi-vehicle coordination, and even apply game theory models to optimize traffic flow in complex scenarios.</p>

                <h3>II. The Trust Game: Psychological Challenges of Coexistence Between Intelligent Vehicles and Humans</h3>
                <p>In real-world traffic environments, intelligent vehicles coexist with human drivers—a relationship that involves not just technical compatibility but also psychological "trust games." Human drivers are accustomed to making "social situational inferences" through brake lights, turn signals, and other cues to predict other vehicles' intentions.</p>
                <p>Trust building relies on "predictability" and "understandability." If intelligent vehicles' behavioral patterns align logically with human drivers' expectations, trust can gradually develop; conversely, if their behavior becomes unpredictable or difficult to interpret, trust may weaken or even collapse entirely.</p>

                <h3>III. Redefining Mobility Spaces: From Transportation Tools to Living Platforms</h3>
                <p>With continuous technological advancements, intelligent vehicles are evolving from mere "transportation tools" into highly adaptable "mobile space units." The deep integration of autonomous driving and AI is not only changing how road resources are utilized but also profoundly reshaping our understanding of "space" and "time."</p>
                <p>In intelligent vehicles, driving is no longer the dominant in-vehicle activity, giving space greater flexibility. Vehicles can transform into "mobile meeting rooms" during commutes, switch to "rest pods" when approaching destinations, or even feature diverse scenarios like "entertainment mode" and "family mode."</p>
                <p>Looking further ahead, the widespread adoption of intelligent vehicles may give rise to a new concept of "mobile neighborhoods." As people become less constrained by fixed locations for work or living, urban functional boundaries will blur, and the fluidity of space and time will be greatly expanded.</p>

                <h3>IV. Conclusion: Intelligent Vehicles as a Mirror of Future Society</h3>
                <p>The rise of intelligent vehicles represents not just a triumph of technological innovation but also humanity's redefinition of its own lifestyle. They are not only "digital citizens" in transportation systems but also key players in the "trust game" with humans and central forces in redefining "mobility spaces."</p>
                <p>In this system, every intelligent vehicle is "learning how to live"—they are not merely technological products but witnesses and participants in societal evolution. Through them, we are stepping into a new era of comprehensive interconnectedness between transportation, life, cities, and society.</p>
