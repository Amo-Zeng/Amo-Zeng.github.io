            <h2>Reshaping the New Paradigm of International Cooperation and Social Assistance</h2>
            <p>In today's increasingly globalized world, international development cooperation and social assistance models are undergoing profound transformations. The traditional "aid dependency" and "one-way aid" models are gradually revealing their limitations, while the concepts of "aid empowerment," "development cooperation," and "humanistic care" are becoming new consensuses in the international community. These shifts in ideology not only reshape the paradigm of international relations but also inject new warmth and depth into social assistance.</p>
