            <h3>I. Opportunities and Challenges of Artificial Intelligence in Nuclear Safety Review</h3>
            <h4>1.1 The Potential of AI Technology in Nuclear Safety Review</h4>
            <p>With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, its application potential in various fields is continuously being explored. As a high-risk and high-tech energy form, the safety review process of nuclear energy is particularly critical. The introduction of AI brings unprecedented opportunities for nuclear safety review, especially in improving review efficiency, processing complex data, and dynamically predicting risks.</p>
            <p>AI's automated processing capabilities can significantly shorten the time required for nuclear safety review. Traditional review methods rely on expert experience and manual analysis, which are time-consuming and prone to human error. AI can automate the processing of large amounts of data, quickly identify potential risks, and reduce the review cycle by 30% to 50%. This efficiency improvement not only reduces review costs but also makes the review process more flexible, allowing for timely responses to emergencies.</p>
            <h4>1.2 Key Challenges in AI Application</h4>
            <p>Although AI shows great potential in nuclear safety review, its application also faces numerous challenges. First, the safety and reliability of AI algorithms are the primary concerns in nuclear safety review. The complex and ever-changing nature of nuclear safety data means that even minor errors can lead to severe consequences. Therefore, AI algorithms must undergo rigorous validation and testing to ensure they operate stably under extreme conditions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the handling of complex nuclear data, such as radioactive materials and reactor design, is another significant challenge. The high complexity of nuclear data requires AI to have powerful multimodal data integration, high-dimensional data processing, and dynamic prediction and adjustment capabilities. By enhancing these capabilities, AI can effectively identify potential safety hazards and adjust analysis models in real-time to ensure timely risk identification.</p>
            <h4>1.3 Ethical and Regulatory Issues</h4>
            <p>The application of AI in nuclear safety review involves not only technical issues but also ethical and legal considerations. Firstly, the use of AI must comply with ethical standards to ensure it does not threaten human safety. A strict ethical review mechanism must be established to ensure that AI development and usage follow transparent, fair, and responsible principles. Additionally, preventing the potential misuse of AI is another critical issue. Nuclear safety review involves national security and public interests, and any improper use of AI could lead to serious consequences. Therefore, a multi-level regulatory mechanism must be put in place to ensure AI technology is not used for malicious purposes.</p>

            <h3>II. Public Engagement and Transparency in Nuclear Safety Review</h3>
            <h4>2.1 Balancing Transparency and Confidentiality</h4>
            <p>In nuclear safety review, information transparency is the foundation of public trust but must also balance national security and technical confidentiality needs. Therefore, it is crucial to determine which information can be made public and which should remain confidential. For example, design standards for nuclear facilities, emergency plans, and environmental impact assessment reports should be prioritized for disclosure, while internal design drawings and technical details of nuclear facilities should remain confidential.</p>
            <p>By establishing a graded information disclosure mechanism, a balance can be found between transparency and confidentiality. For instance, information can be categorized based on sensitivity, with low-sensitivity information prioritized for disclosure, while medium to high-sensitivity information requires strict review and authorization before release. This approach not only meets public知情 needs but also ensures national security and technical secrets are not compromised.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Enhancing Public Understanding and Engagement with Modern Technology</h4>
            <p>The public often struggles to understand abstract nuclear safety information, especially when it involves complex technical jargon and safety metrics. To improve public acceptance of nuclear safety information, modern technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) can be powerful tools. Through VR technology, the public can "enter" nuclear power plants and gain an intuitive understanding of how nuclear facilities operate and the safety measures in place, thereby reducing their unfamiliarity and fear of nuclear energy. Additionally, AR technology can simulate real emergency scenarios during drills, helping the public learn correct response measures and boosting their confidence in nuclear safety measures.</p>
            <h4>2.3 Optimizing Public Engagement Mechanisms</h4>
            <p>The effectiveness of public engagement mechanisms directly impacts the legitimacy and credibility of nuclear safety review. By introducing diverse forms of public engagement, such as community roundtables, online public forums, and expert advisory committees, public participation can be increased. Furthermore, through education and outreach, incentive mechanisms, and transparent feedback mechanisms, the influence of public participation can be enhanced, ensuring that public opinions are fully considered in nuclear safety review.</p>
