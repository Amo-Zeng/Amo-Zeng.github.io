            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As global climate change and sustainability challenges intensify, green bonds, as a critical tool connecting capital markets with environmental goals, are experiencing unprecedented opportunities and challenges. Green bonds not only provide financial support for low-carbon transitions but also, through technological innovation and the expansion of social benefits, are gradually becoming a core financial instrument for achieving multi-dimensional sustainability goals. However, the healthy growth of the green bond market relies on the collaborative advancement of transparency governance, technology enabling, and multi-dimensional benefits. This article will explore how green bonds can play a greater role in the global sustainability process from three dimensions: "greenwashing" risks and transparency governance, social benefits of green bonds and multi-dimensional sustainability goals, and digital technology enabling the green bond market.</p>

            <h2>1. "Greenwashing" Risks and Transparency Governance: The Foundation for the Healthy Development of Green Bonds</h2>
            <p>The rapid growth of green bonds provides significant financial support for global low-carbon transitions, but its scale expansion also comes with increased "greenwashing" risks.</p>
            <h3>1.1 Ambiguity in Standards and Insufficient Information Disclosure</h3>
            <p>Currently, the global green bond market lacks unified standards, with differences in regulations set by various countries and institutions, leading to ambiguity in the definition of the "green" attributes of some green bonds.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Blockchain Technology Drives Transparency Revolution</h3>
            <p>To address "greenwashing" risks, blockchain technology, with its decentralized, tamper-proof, and traceable characteristics, offers a new solution for the transparency governance of green bonds.</p>

            <h2>2. Multi-Dimensional Expansion of Green Bonds: From Environmental Benefits to Social Benefits</h2>
            <p>As global understanding of sustainability goals (SDGs) deepens, the application scope of green bonds is gradually expanding from single environmental benefits to social and economic dimensions.</p>
            <h3>2.1 Social Benefits of Green Bonds: Practical Cases and Innovations</h3>
            <p>Société Générale pioneered the issuance of green bonds with social benefits, used to fund renewable energy projects in impoverished regions.</p>
            <h3>2.2 Construction of Multi-Dimensional Benefit Evaluation Frameworks</h3>
            <p>To better achieve multi-dimensional sustainability goals, the benefit evaluation framework of green bonds needs further improvement.</p>
