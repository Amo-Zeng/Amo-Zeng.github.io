            <h2>Reshaping and Transcending Philosophy: From "Existential Technology" to "Non-Human Thinking"</h2>
            <p>In contemporary society, the role of philosophy is undergoing an unprecedented transformation. It is no longer confined to metaphysical speculation or abstract theoretical systems but is gradually evolving into an "existential technology" that profoundly influences human lifestyles. However, with the deepening of modernity and the rapid advancement of technology, philosophy has also fallen into the dilemma of the "failure narrative," even being questioned as to whether it is uniquely human. This article explores the multiple roles of philosophy in modern society and its future possibilities by integrating the perspectives of "existential technology," "failure narrative," and "non-human philosophy."</p>

            <h3>1. Philosophy as "Existential Technology": Reshaping Modern Lifestyles</h3>
            <p>The concept of philosophy as "existential technology" marks a shift from theory to practice. It no longer merely seeks ultimate truth or the essence of the world but becomes a practical wisdom guiding people on how to "exist." This technology, through critical and reflective approaches, helps individuals find meaning and direction in complex social, cultural, and psychological environments.</p>
            <p>For example, existentialist philosophy emphasizes individual freedom and responsibility in the face of an absurd world, while phenomenology, by reducing the essence of experience, helps people understand their existential state more clearly. These ideas not only provide theoretical frameworks but also serve as guides for individuals to navigate real-life challenges. Modern philosophy, through the awakening of individual consciousness, the reconstruction of meaning and values, the re-examination of social relationships, and the reconciliation of technology and ethics, profoundly reshapes modern lifestyles.</p>
            <p>However, although philosophy as "existential technology" plays a significant role at the individual level, it struggles to address the crises of modernity. The "failure narrative" of modern philosophy reveals its inherent contradictions and limitations.</p>

            <h3>2. The "Failure Narrative" of Modern Philosophy: Why Philosophy Failed to Save Modernity?</h3>
            <p>The "failure narrative" of modern philosophy stems from its inherent contradictions, its misinterpretation of the crises of modernity, and its marginalized status in contemporary society. First, in its pursuit of universality and absolute truth, modern philosophy has overlooked the value of specificity and diversity, rendering it unable to address the complex and multifaceted problems of real life. Second, the crises of modernity span political, economic, and cultural domains, yet philosophy often approaches them from a singular perspective, leading to solutions that lack comprehensiveness and relevance. Finally, with the rapid development of science and technology and the increasing specialization of society, philosophy has gradually lost its central role in traditional society and is often seen as a "useless discipline."</p>
            <p>However, despite the "failure narrative," we cannot negate the value and significance of philosophy. As the essence of human thought and the crystallization of wisdom, philosophy remains irreplaceable. It can guide us to deeply reflect on the roots and nature of the crises of modernity, providing diverse perspectives and solutions. At the same time, philosophy can offer crucial support and guidance in terms of values and spiritual pursuits for modern society.</p>

            <h3>3. The Rise of Non-Human Philosophy: Expanding and Transcending Philosophical Thought</h3>
            <p>While philosophy faces the "failure narrative," a new philosophical trend—"non-human philosophy"—is gradually emerging. This trend challenges the anthropocentrism of traditional philosophy and explores whether philosophical thought is uniquely human. Non-human philosophy expands the definition and boundaries of philosophical thought through various perspectives, including animal philosophy, plant philosophy, machine philosophy, and ecological philosophy.</p>
            <p>For example, animal philosophy explores whether animals' cognitive and emotional experiences constitute a primitive form of philosophical thought; plant philosophy examines whether plants possess a form of "consciousness" or "thought" through complex chemical signaling networks; machine philosophy focuses on whether artificial intelligence systems are capable of philosophical thought; and ecological philosophy investigates whether ecosystems possess a form of "collective thought."</p>
            <p>The rise of non-human philosophy not only challenges anthropocentrism but also promotes interdisciplinary research and ethical and moral reflection. It reminds us that philosophical thought may not be uniquely human, and other life forms and systems may possess their own forms of philosophical thought. This trend provides us with new perspectives and methods to more comprehensively understand the world and ourselves.</p>

            <h3>4. The Future of Philosophy: From "Existential Technology" to "Non-Human Thinking"</h3>
            <p>As "existential technology," philosophy plays a significant role at the individual level but struggles to address the crises of modernity. The "failure narrative" of modern philosophy reveals its inherent contradictions and limitations, but it also provides an opportunity for reflection and reconstruction. The rise of non-human philosophy further expands the definition and boundaries of philosophical thought, challenging the anthropocentrism of traditional philosophy.</p>
            <p>In future philosophical explorations, we may discover that philosophical thought is a more universal and diverse phenomenon, existing in life forms and systems beyond humans. By combining philosophy as "existential technology" with non-human philosophy, we may find a more inclusive, diverse, and sustainable philosophical paradigm, offering deeper guidance and inspiration for human existence.</p>
            <p>As Heidegger once said, "Philosophy is not a form of knowledge but a way of being." By integrating philosophy into life and transcending the limitations of anthropocentrism, we may discover a more authentic, free, and meaningful way of existence.</p>
