            <h3>Multidisciplinary Analysis of Symptoms: A Case of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</h3>
            <p>This article selects a 30-year-old male as the research subject, whose primary symptom is severe compulsive washing behavior. The patient spends several hours washing his hands daily and repeatedly cleans his living environment, severely impacting his quality of life and occupational functioning, accompanied by intense anxiety and emotional distress.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Psychoanalytic Perspective:</strong> Compulsive behaviors in patients are a ritualized way to resist internal fears, representing suppression and resistance to unacceptable desires and emotions.</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Psychology Perspective:</strong> The symptoms may stem from "catastrophic thinking," where the belief is that "if cleaning is not done, disaster will occur."</li>
                <li><strong>Social-Cultural Perspective:</strong> The cleaning behavior may symbolize a desire for control and fear of moral stigma in modern society.</li>
                <li><strong>Literary and Artistic Perspective:</strong> Obsessive-compulsive symptoms possess unique symbolic and aesthetic qualities, symbolizing the eternal struggle of humans facing meaninglessness and futility.</li>
                <li><strong>Philosophical Thinking:</strong> The patient's fear of external contamination can be seen as anxiety over the loss of self-other boundaries, reflecting modern individuals' sense of disorientation and insecurity in complex societies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ethical Dilemmas in Psychoanalytic Therapy</h3>
            <p>In psychoanalytic therapy, therapists often face complex ethical dilemmas. Below are several typical case analyses:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Confidentiality vs. Informed Consent Boundaries:</strong> Therapists must balance protecting potential victims with maintaining the therapeutic relationship.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Dynamics Between Therapist and Patient:</strong> Excessive dependency may hinder the patient's self-growth, posing challenges to the therapist's ethical boundaries.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenges of Dual Relationships:</strong> Therapists must navigate professional distance while managing potential community interactions.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Narrative Reconstruction in Psychoanalytic Cases</h3>
            <p>The essence of psychoanalysis is a dialogue with the unconscious. Through techniques such as free association, dream interpretation, and resistance analysis, analysts reveal the deep-seated pain and truths within the client's psyche. Narrative serves both as a product of the analytical process and a tool for understanding.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Narrative Reconstruction:</strong> By constructing narratives, analysts help clients re-examine their erroneous beliefs and traumatic experiences, imbuing them with new, more constructive meanings.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Dimension:</strong> Analysts must respect the client's subjectivity when constructing narratives, avoiding imposing their interpretations on the client.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Multidimensional explorations of psychoanalysis not only reveal the complex mechanisms behind symptoms but also highlight the importance of ethical challenges and narrative reconstruction in the therapeutic process. Through interdisciplinary integration and ethical reflection, psychoanalysis provides a more comprehensive theoretical framework and practical pathway for psychotherapy. Narrative reconstruction, as an art of understanding and healing, achieves the transformation from the unconscious to comprehension through language, and through narrative construction, redefines and adjusts the client's inner world.</p>
