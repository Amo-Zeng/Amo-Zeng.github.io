            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the context of rapid technological advancement, data has become a crucial resource driving social progress and economic growth. However, the conflict between data utilization and personal privacy protection has become increasingly apparent, necessitating effective solutions. Differential privacy, as an emerging privacy protection technology, offers a robust response to this conflict. This article systematically explores the fundamental concepts of differential privacy, its practical applications in edge computing and machine learning, and delves into its social impact and ethical challenges, while looking ahead to future trends.</p>

            <h2>1. Differential Privacy: The Gold Standard of Privacy Protection</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Fundamental Concepts of Differential Privacy</h3>
            <p>The core idea of differential privacy is to add "noise" to data release or analysis processes, so that even if an attacker obtains the analysis results, they cannot infer specific individual information. The mathematical foundation of this technology stems from the concept of "neighboring" databases, emphasizing that the difference between two databases is only whether a specific individual's record exists.</p>
            <p>Highlights of differential privacy include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quantitative Privacy Protection:</strong> Utilizing the privacy budget parameter ε to provide precise privacy protection design.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistance to Attacks:</strong> Even if an attacker possesses all knowledge, individual information remains uninferable.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>1.2 Advantages of Differential Privacy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rigorous Definition:</strong> Provides a mathematically consistent and rigorous definition.</li>
                <li><strong>High Flexibility:</strong> Covers various data analysis and machine learning tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Composability:</strong> Combining multiple differential privacy mechanisms still maintains its properties.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Differential Privacy in Edge Computing</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Privacy Challenges in Edge Computing</h3>
            <p>Edge computing brings computational and storage resources closer to the data source, significantly reducing latency and bandwidth consumption. However, this flexibility introduces new privacy challenges, with a large amount of personal data being processed on local devices or edge nodes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Data Processing:</strong> Edge devices directly process sensitive information with insufficient protection mechanisms.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Sharing and Collaboration:</strong> Data sharing among multiple edge nodes increases the risk of data theft.</li>
                <li><strong>Malicious Attacks:</strong> Edge devices are more susceptible to physical attacks, increasing risks.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2.2 Solutions for Differential Privacy in Edge Computing</h3>
            <p>Applying differential privacy technology in edge computing can protect user privacy while effectively utilizing the advantages of edge computing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Collection and Release:</strong> Introduce differential privacy mechanisms.</li>
                <li><strong>Distributed Machine Learning:</strong> Implement distributed machine learning to ensure privacy in data sharing and model parameter updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Blockchain Integration:</strong> Combine blockchain characteristics with edge computing to secure data sharing.</li>
            </ul>
