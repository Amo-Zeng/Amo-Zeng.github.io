            <h2>I. Conceptual Proposal: Urban Ecological Debt — A Hidden Global Overdraft</h2>
            <p>Never before in human history have so many lives been compressed into such dense spaces. Over 56% of the global population now lives in cities, which occupy only 3% of the Earth's land area yet consume 75% of global natural resources and generate over 70% of carbon emissions. Behind this highly intensive mode of existence lies a neglected ethical proposition—<strong>urban ecological debt</strong>.</p>
            <p>"Ecological debt" does not refer to financial liabilities, but rather to the <strong>hidden resource overdraft</strong> accumulated by high-density cities over time, drawn from global ecosystems—especially remote, fragile, and ecologically sensitive regions. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Material extraction</strong>: Urban expansion relies on global supply chains. From cobalt mines in the Congo to timber in the Amazon, the process of building cities is a process of "hemorrhaging" from peripheral ecosystems;</li>
                <li><strong>Carbon footprint displacement</strong>: Manufacturing, shipping, and aviation driven by urban consumption transfer carbon emissions to the global atmosphere, while climate disasters disproportionately affect vulnerable regions;</li>
                <li><strong>Water cycle dependence</strong>: Cities draw water from inter-basin transfers or deep aquifers, disrupting upstream hydrological balances—e.g., Beijing's reliance on the South-North Water Transfer Project is, in effect, "borrowing" water from the Yangtze River Basin.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>More profoundly, this overdraft not only affects natural systems but also erodes <strong>biocultural diversity</strong>—the symbiotic relationship between biological diversity and the indigenous knowledge, languages, beliefs, and lifestyles of specific regions. The "long-distance extraction" of resources by cities often coincides with the neglect or suppression of traditional ecological knowledge (e.g., crop rotation, agroforestry, seed preservation).</p>
            <p>Thus, ecological debt is not merely material—it is also a <strong>cultural and cognitive debt</strong>: cities enjoy ecosystem services while severing their deep connections with land, species, and ancestral wisdom.</p>

            <h2>II. Theoretical Breakthrough: From "North-South Aid" to "Asymmetric but Reciprocal" Cooperation</h2>
            <p>Traditional environmental governance often falls into the "North-South aid" framework: developed nations provide funds to developing nations in exchange for ecological "protection" outcomes. This model is inherently a form of <strong>unilateral charity</strong>, reinforcing power imbalances and overlooking the autonomy and knowledge value of marginalized communities.</p>
            <p>We propose a paradigm of "<strong>asymmetric but reciprocal</strong>" cooperation: acknowledging the asymmetries in resources, power, and information between cities and remote ecological communities, yet achieving joint ecological and cultural value enhancement through <strong>mutual value exchange</strong>.</p>
            <p>The key insight: <strong>ecological value and cultural knowledge are not one-way exports, but tradable "ecocultural assets"</strong>. Cities possess capital, technology, and policy influence; communities hold irreplaceable knowledge—local seed banks, traditional water management, and ecological early warning systems. Cooperation is not "charity," but "settlement"—cities "pay" their ecological debt through funding, technology, and market access, in exchange for community knowledge assets, creating a sustainable cycle of reciprocity.</p>
            <p>This model breaks the colonial logic of "donor-recipient" dynamics, grounding ecological justice in <strong>knowledge sovereignty</strong> and <strong>cultural respect</strong>.</p>

            <h2>III. Case Studies: Practical Pathways to Settle Ecological Debt</h2>
            <h3>1. Nordic Cities × African Seed Banks: Knowledge for Conservation</h3>
            <p>The city government of Oslo, Norway, funds farming communities in Mali and Burkina Faso to establish local seed banks, preserving endangered traditional crops (e.g., drought-resistant millet, native sorghum). In return, the city gains access to <strong>adaptive genetic data</strong> and <strong>traditional farming knowledge</strong> for urban agriculture research. Meanwhile, communities receive funding, refrigeration equipment, and integration into global seed networks, enabling "knowledge capitalization."</p>

            <h3>2. Chinese Cities × Southeast Asian Rainforests: Transboundary Watershed Co-Management</h3>
            <p>Kunming (Yunnan, China) and rainforest communities in northern Laos have established a "transboundary watershed co-management agreement." Kunming provides ecological compensation funds to support upstream forest conservation and water quality monitoring. In return, communities share their <strong>intergenerational rainforest hydrological knowledge</strong> (e.g., sacred mountain taboos, seasonal rotational grazing), helping Kunming optimize urban water infrastructure. The project also creates a "digital water culture archive," documenting rituals, myths, and ecological practices.</p>

            <h3>3. Latin American Cities × Andean Indigenous Communities: Knowledge-Sharing Platforms</h3>
            <p>The Lima city government collaborates with Quechua communities in the Andes to establish an "Ecological Knowledge Exchange." Quechua people contribute traditional domestication techniques for potatoes, quinoa, and other crops, while Lima offers pilot urban rooftop farm platforms. Indigenous knowledge is applied to combat urban heat islands, and their languages and agricultural calendars are integrated into urban ecological education programs.</p>
            <p>Together, these cases reveal a core truth: <strong>settling ecological debt is not simply about "paying money," but about "exchanging knowledge"—using urban resources to acquire the cultural wisdom of marginalized communities, achieving mutual enhancement of ecological resilience</strong>.</p>

            <h2>IV. Model Construction: A Cross-Scale "City-Watershed-Biosphere" Responsibility Framework</h2>
            <p>We propose the <strong>City-Watershed-Biosphere (CWB)</strong> cross-scale responsibility model, situating cities within a global ecological network and clarifying their chain of responsibility:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>City</strong>: Consumption node, bearing responsibility as the initiator of ecological debt;</li>
                <li><strong>Watershed</strong>: Intermediate node, the critical conduit for resource transfer and ecological impact;</li>
                <li><strong>Biosphere</strong>: Supply node, the origin of resources and knowledge.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Operational tools for this model include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Ecological Footprint Tracing System</strong>: Using blockchain and GIS technologies to trace the origins of urban construction materials, food, and energy, quantifying resource extraction from specific ecological zones;</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural-Ecological Knowledge Database</strong>: A globally shared platform cataloging indigenous ecological knowledge, annotated with geographic, species, and linguistic attributes, enabling cities to "purchase" knowledge;</li>
                <li><strong>Urban Ecological Service Payment Mechanism (UESP)</strong>: Cities pay "ecological service fees" to specific biosphere communities based on their ecological footprint. Funds support knowledge preservation, ecosystem restoration, and youth training.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For example, if 30% of a city's timber comes from the Congo rainforest, its UESP account automatically allocates funds to local communities, with priority given to adopting their traditional forest management practices.</p>

            <h2>V. Policy Pathways: Embedding into Global Governance Frameworks</h2>
            <p>This paradigm must be integrated into three major international frameworks to drive institutional change:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>New Urban Agenda</strong>: Revise "urban sustainability" indicators to include metrics such as "ecological debt settlement rate" and "traditional knowledge cooperation index";</li>
                <li><strong>UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</strong>: Incorporate "asymmetric reciprocity cooperation" clauses into SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land);</li>
                <li><strong>International Climate Negotiations</strong>: Establish a "Urban Climate Responsibility" mechanism requiring cities to submit ecological debt reports and commit at least 10% of climate funds to knowledge exchange projects.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Additionally, a "Global Urban Ecological Settlement Fund" could be established, managed by UNEP, to support pilot and scaling-up of the CWB model.</p>

            <h2>VI. Conclusion: From Resource Consumer to Cross-Scale Ecological Responsibility Bearer</h2>
            <p>Cities should not merely be "consumers" of ecosystems, but <strong>cross-scale bearers of ecological responsibility</strong>. Settling ecological debt is not only a moral obligation—it is a survival imperative.</p>
            <p>The "asymmetric but reciprocal" cooperation paradigm offers a <strong>decentralized, decolonized</strong> new pathway for global ecological governance. It acknowledges that true sustainability lies not in maximizing technological efficiency, but in <strong>reconnecting cities with land, modernity with tradition, and the global with the local</strong>.</p>
            <p>When a city calculates not only its GDP but also its ecological footprint; when it listens not only to foreign experts but also to elders of the rainforest; when it values not only green technology but also traditional farming practices—then it truly begins to "repay its debt" and move toward a more just and resilient future.</p>
            <p>This is not merely ecological settlement—it is civilizational awakening: <strong>cities will finally learn to say "thank you" to the Earth, and to repay that forgotten debt through the exchange of knowledge</strong>.</p>
