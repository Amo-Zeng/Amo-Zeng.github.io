            <h3>【Labyrinth of Forking Paths】Scalpel and Astrolabe</h3>
            <p>On the third tier of the Acropolis, wine-stained papyrus records the golden ratio of tragedy. In a Tokyo Roppongi underground theater, shimmering light points climb along the iris patterns of the audience, dissecting the tears welling in Oedipus' eyes into 36 data strata. <span class="highlight">As Dionysian revelry transforms into blinking server arrays, the amphitheater morphs into an electronic gallbladder devouring perceptions</span>—actors' motion-capture sensors detach from flesh, while audiences experience parallel universes through flickering AR goggles. The cognitive rails of Aristotle's catharsis are now being diverted into data swamps by algorithmic switchmen.</p>

            <h3>1. Withered Roots and New Umbilicus</h3>
            <p>Beckett's barren tree sprouts silicon roots: 237 pressure sensors lie beneath the stage in Berlin Metropol Theater's new production of <em>Waiting for Godot</em>. Every time Vladimir kicks gravel, six concurrent London West End versions accelerate their narrative collapse. Foucault's panopticon now ruptures inversely—<span class="highlight">each blink of the audience rewrites Estragon's lines</span>, like advertisers' slogans emerging in steam mirrors after each wipe of bathroom condensation.</p>

            <h3>2. Trembling Amygdala</h3>
            <p>Neurowanderers at University of Milan discovered that fear levels triggered by the dagger's gleam in <em>Hamlet</em> Act III precisely match the stock curve of the theater's tech sponsor. On nights when mirror neurons go on strike, servers record 74.8% of audiences uploading insomnia EEG patterns—<span class="highlight">3.5 bloodiness units higher than post-horror-movie neurochemical residues</span>. This isn't tragic purification, but data barns being cleansed through Homeric tides.</p>

                <p>Odor sampling day 9: seat leather exudes marionette camphor/When Julia unbuttons her third button, viewer #47's 0.3℃ temperature drop triggers arc radiation/The monitor says his sternocleidomastoid tremor matches captured spies/We feed his salivary pH to AI playwrights/Now mascara and Bloody Mary remnants in dressing rooms/Become alchemical purgatives of our era</p>
