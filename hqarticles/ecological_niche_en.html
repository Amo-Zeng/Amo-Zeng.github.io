            <h2>Multidimensional Evolution of Niches: From Natural Selection to Human Intervention</h2>
            <p>The niche, a core concept in ecology, describes the position a species occupies in its ecosystem and its interactions with both biological and abiotic environments. This concept not only determines the survival strategies of species but also profoundly influences their morphology, physiology, and behavior patterns, thereby driving their evolution. However, with the intensification of human activities such as industrialization, urbanization, and agricultural expansion, niches are undergoing unprecedented changes that pose a severe threat to biodiversity and ecosystem health.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Tropical Rainforests: Biodiversity and Vulnerability of Niches</h3>
            <p>In the species-rich ecosystem of tropical rainforests, the diversity of niches is particularly significant. Each species shares resources through unique survival strategies, maintaining a complex ecological balance. However, with the intrusion of human activities such as deforestation and land clearing, these niches are at risk of being lost, leading to a sharp decline in species dependent on them and thereby destabilizing the entire ecosystem.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Desert Ecosystems: Adaptation and Vulnerability</h3>
            <p>The niches in desert ecosystems exhibit distinct adaptive characteristics. Due to the scarcity of water resources, organisms in deserts have evolved special physiological structures and behavioral patterns to adapt to extreme environmental conditions. However, climate change and overgrazing by humans are accelerating the deterioration of desert environments, making these niches increasingly vulnerable and threatening the stability of the entire desert ecosystem.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Wetland Ecosystems: Biodiversity and Human Pressure</h3>
            <p>Wetlands, another ecosystem with a high diversity of niches, also face pressures from human activities. With the advancement of urbanization and the expansion of agricultural land, many wetlands are being drained or filled, leading to the loss of niches for these species and affecting the functions of the wetland ecosystem.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Niche and Species Evolution: Natural Selection and Adaptive Radiation</h3>
            <p>There is a close connection between niches and species evolution. The diversity of niches is a key factor in species divergence. Through mechanisms such as natural selection and adaptive radiation, species continuously evolve to adapt to their specific niches. However, human activities are disrupting this evolutionary balance, making many species unable to adapt to new environmental pressures and thus facing the risk of extinction.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Niche Competition: A Driving Force for Evolution</h3>
            <p>Niche competition is a significant driving force for species evolution. In environments with limited resources, competition among species drives them to continuously optimize their niches. However, with the expansion of agriculture and land clearing, these niches are facing fragmentation, leading to intensified competition for resource acquisition among species and thereby affecting the stability and evolution of populations.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Far-Reaching Impacts of Human Activities on Niches</h3>
            <p>The far-reaching impacts of human activities on niches have become a focal point in current ecological research. Human activities such as industrialization and urbanization, agricultural expansion, resource extraction, and global climate change not only alter the natural environment of the Earth but also significantly impact biological niches. These changes often lead to the loss, fragmentation, and shifting of niches, thereby threatening biodiversity and ecosystem health.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion and Future Directions</h3>
            <p>In summary, the multidimensional evolution of niches is driven not only by natural selection and adaptive radiation but also by the far-reaching impacts of human activities. To mitigate these impacts, we need to take a series of measures, including protecting existing natural habitats, controlling agricultural expansion, reducing resource extraction, addressing climate change, and managing invasive species. Through these efforts, we can better protect biological niches, maintain the health and sustainability of Earth's ecosystems.</p>
