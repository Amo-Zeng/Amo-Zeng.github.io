                <p>In the 21st-century global political landscape, the rise of populism has transcended traditional left-right ideological divides, evolving into a profound <strong>symptom of modernity</strong>. This article proposes a “<strong>Triple Modernity Crisis</strong>” analytical framework, organically integrating three cutting-edge perspectives—the “Algorithmic Emotion Economy” (see “Algorithmic Emotion Economy” analysis), the “Ritual Performance of Collective Trauma” (see “Ritual Performance” research), and the “Post-Truth Ecosystem” (see “Post-Truth Ecosystem” framework)—to systematically explain that populism is not merely a political rebellion but a complex product of the nested and symbiotic evolution of technological structures, psychological mechanisms, and communication environments. These three dimensions reinforce each other, forming a self-perpetuating crisis system. Only by delving into their interactive logic can viable governance paths be provided.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>I. Algorithmic Emotion Economy: The Emotional Exploitation of Platform Capitalism</h3>
                <p>The first dimension of populism's modernity crisis is rooted in <strong>platform capitalism's systematic capture and commodification of human emotions</strong>. In the algorithm-dominated attention economy, populist emotions—anger, fear, prejudice, and a sense of belonging—become the most circulating political currency.</p>
                <p>Social platform recommendation algorithms are not value-neutral; they have a built-in <strong>structural preference</strong> for high-arousal content. Research shows that populist labels (e.g., #ImmigrantThreat, #EliteCorruption) spread 3.2 times faster than rational policy discussions (see “Algorithmic Emotion Economy” analysis). For instance, the viral spread of the “#StopTheSteal” topic on TikTok leveraged the “emotional density advantage” of “quick edits + inflammatory music + emotional captions” to撬动 (lever) traffic distribution. Platforms achieve dual monetization: direct revenue through ad sharing (Meta's financial reports show 38% of its revenue comes from high-interaction content) and mechanisms like influencer live streams and virtual gifts, transforming user emotions into a sustainable <strong>emotional capital cycle</strong>.</p>
                <p>A deeper crisis lies in the algorithm-shaped <strong>positive feedback loop</strong>: angry content → algorithmic recommendation → attracts more angry users → emotional interaction reinforcement → further expanded recommendations. Populism thus is no longer the spread of a specific ideology but increasingly an <strong>endogenous tendency of the algorithmic ecosystem</strong>. As Orban's team in Hungary raised $50,000 in a single TikTok live stream, populist politics has become deeply entwined with the “emotional entrepreneurship” business model. In this dimension, populism is a product of modern technological rationality turning alienated—algorithms, born to optimize connection, ultimately become a driver tearing society apart.</p>

                <h3>II. Ritual Performance of Collective Trauma: The Sacred Compensation of Irrationality</h3>
                <p>However, purely technical analysis cannot explain the <strong>sustained investment and psychological loyalty</strong> of populist emotions. The second crisis emerges at the socio-psychological level: populism provides irrational trauma healing for the losers of globalization through <strong>ritual performance</strong>.</p>
                <p>Modernity traumas like financial crises, cultural identity dissolution, and class status decline plunge many groups into existential anxiety (see “Ritual Performance” research). Populism's response is not to propose practical solutions but to provide a set of <strong>ritualized symbols and practices</strong> that rebuild psychological order through emotional performance. Trump's MAGA rallies are typical: red hats, seas of flags, collective chants of “Lock her up!” and other elements combine to form a meaningful ritual drama. Psychological research confirms that <strong>embodied synchrony</strong> significantly enhances group belonging and psychological resilience. Participants transform from “unrelated individuals” into members of the “great people,” temporarily gaining a sense of control and dignity.</p>
                <p>A similar logic is seen in European right-wing “border marches”: German AfD supporters deliberately traverse immigrant communities,宣誓 (declaring) “sovereignty return” through spatial practice. Label-based attacks in online fights (e.g., “woke,” “snowflake”) become <strong>purification rituals</strong> in the digital age. In the TikTok challenge “#MeineStimmeZählt,” teenagers展示 (display) dilapidated neighborhoods and shout slogans, completing the public performance of trauma. Rituals thus serve four functions: <strong>imposing order, rebuilding belonging, providing agency, and filling with meaning</strong>—all deep needs that instrumental rationality cannot satisfy. Populism here reveals another failure of modernity: after the promise of material prosperity shattered, it failed to provide alternatives for spiritual loss.</p>

                <h3>III. Post-Truth Ecosystem: Truth Meltdown and Narrative Warfare</h3>
                <p>The third crisis is born at the communication environment level: the <strong>post-truth ecosystem</strong> provides the cognitive soil necessary for populism's survival. Populism and post-truth are not simply causal but <strong>symbiotic</strong> entities that nourish each other (see “Post-Truth Ecosystem” framework).</p>
                <p>Populism's “people vs. elite” binary opposition naturally fits the operational logic of post-truth: anti-intellectualism, distrust of institutions, and leader charisma. When Trump systematically stigmatized mainstream media with “Fake News,” 73% of his supporters consequently believed the media deliberately distorted facts (see “Post-Truth Ecosystem” framework). This clears cognitive barriers for populist narratives, making belief rely not on evidence but on <strong>emotional resonance and identity</strong>.</p>
                <p>The post-truth environment provides populism with three advantages: <strong>emotion priority</strong> (algorithms favor emotional content), <strong>chamber reinforcement</strong> (echo chambers solidify偏见 (bias)), and <strong>polarization acceleration</strong> (spiral of silence suppresses dissent). In the 2020 “Stop the Steal” movement, false accusations were forwarded over 10 million times within 48 hours in Telegram groups,塑造 (shaping) a cognitive universe parallel to mainstream society.</p>
                <p>Artificial intelligence pushes this symbiosis into an automated stage: deepfakes (e.g., fake Biden declaring martial law), AI-generated text, and social bots jointly create a <strong>post-truth positive feedback loop</strong>: AI produces misinformation → algorithm推送 (pushes) → user emotional response → user再生产 (reproduction) → AI learning optimization → new round of diffusion. The use of AI-cloned Modi's voice sending personalized appeals in the 2024 Indian elections marks a new stage of populist mobilization进入 (entering) <strong>human-machine collaboration</strong>. The post-truth ecosystem thus becomes a crisis of modernity's cognitive foundation: the publicity of truth is彻底 (thoroughly) fragmented, replaced by tribes of emotional认同 (identification).</p>

                <h3>IV. The Symbiotic Logic of the Triple Crisis: A Self-Reinforcing System</h3>
                <p>The aforementioned triple crises do not exist independently but form a <strong>dynamically reinforcing system</strong> through intricate interactions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Algorithms provide the technical foundation for rituals</strong>: TikTok's challenge templates, automatic music matching, and filter effects significantly lower the threshold for ritual creation. The “#LaFranceEstEnDanger” challenge initiated by France's Zemmour used platform tools to achieve the <strong>routinization and popularization</strong> of populist rituals, enabling every user to easily participate in symbolic production.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rituals provide psychological legitimacy for post-truth</strong>: The embodied synchrony and emotional resonance in MAGA rallies allow participants to deeply experience the “people” identity, thus believing false narratives like “election fraud” as “our truth.” Ritual emotions become the <strong>cognitive anchor for post-truth</strong>, granting it a psychological sense of reality beyond evidence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-truth feeds back into the algorithmic economy</strong>: Post-truth content gains higher algorithmic weight and advertising revenue due to its emotional extremity, forming a closed loop of “<strong>emotion—traffic—capital</strong>.” Populist leaders monetize collective anger into economic resources through live stream donations, encouraging more extreme content production.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This system exhibits typical complex system characteristics: <strong>non-linearity</strong> (small events trigger chain reactions), <strong>adaptability</strong> (if banned, migrate to new platforms), <strong>resilience</strong> (even if specific lies are debunked, the overall narrative persists), and <strong>path dependency</strong> (once entering a cognitive echo chamber, it's extremely difficult to reverse).</p>

                <h3>V. Governance Reconstruction: From Point Intervention to System Repair</h3>
                <p>Faced with the triple crisis, traditional “fact-checking” and “account banning” are like a drop in the bucket, urgently requiring a shift to <strong>system-level governance</strong>:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Algorithmic transparency and depolarization design</strong>: Mandate platforms to disclose emotion scoring models, introduce “cognitive immune” algorithms to proactively recommend counter-bias content, and break the emotional exploitation cycle of recommendation engines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Constructive ritual alternatives</strong>: Fund community dialogue, cross-group empathy projects, and other <strong>inclusive rituals</strong> to provide healthy channels for trauma expression, preventing populism from monopolizing the emotional healing market.</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-truth literacy education</strong>: Cultivate public ability to identify deepfakes and understand algorithmic manipulation, develop “emotional health dashboards” to help users reflect on how their emotions are being exploited.</li>
                    <li><strong>Platform ecological responsibility</strong>: Require platforms to扮演 (play) the role of “digital commons guardians,” establish mechanisms for marking AI-generated content and labeling social bots, and explore “Civic Algorithms” to promote rational dialogue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical countermeasures</strong>: Develop AI-detecting-AI, deepfake溯源 (tracing) watermarking, and other technologies to build a “<strong>digital immune system</strong>,” increasing the dissemination cost of false information.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section class="article-conclusion">
                <h3>Conclusion: Beyond Crisis—Rebuilding the Digital Democratic Commons</h3>
                <p>The triple modernity crisis of populism reflects the deep困境 (dilemma) of democracy in the digital age: <strong>algorithmic exploitation of emotion, ritual's exclusive appropriation of trauma, and post-truth's erosion of rational cognition</strong>. Their intertwining reminds us: the rise of populism is not only a political problem but a systematic failure of technological, psychological, and communication architectures.</p>
                <p>The path to governance lies not in eliminating populist expression but in <strong>reshaping the foundational rules of the digital ecosystem</strong>: building platform designs that do not profit from human weaknesses, cultivating identity rituals that do not come at the cost of excluding others, and fostering public communication that does not betray truth. This means moving beyond technological instrumentalism towards <strong>ethical and ecological reconstruction</strong>—making technology serve democratic deepening rather than populist carnival, allowing collective trauma to receive rational疏导 (channeling) rather than irrational宣泄 (venting), and grounding public dialogue in fact rather than emotional illusion.</p>
                <p>Populism is a warning signal of the modernity crisis. It exposes an emotionally world forced into commodification, an identity anxiety craving recognition but denied, and a cognitive wasteland where truth is disordered. Only by addressing these three dimensions simultaneously can we hope to awaken from the crisis and move towards a democratic future that balances rationality and emotion, consensus and diversity, technology and humanity.</p>
