            <p>At the intersection of global digital transformation and geopolitical restructuring, populism is undergoing a profound shift—from a "sentiment against the establishment" to a "systemic governance model." This article proposes a <strong>trinitarian analytical framework</strong> of <strong>sovereignty—structure—identity</strong> to reveal the core mechanism of 21st-century populism: <strong>techno-populism</strong>, <strong>populist embeddedness</strong>, and <strong>mnemonic governance</strong> are not isolated phenomena, but interact institutionally to form a self-reinforcing closed-loop system. This framework transcends the traditional "emotion-discourse" research paradigm, focusing instead on how states in the digital age use technological tools to reconstruct political legitimacy, economic structures, and cultural identities—forming a new governance logic that combines exclusivity with mobilizing power.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Political Dimension: Techno-Populism and the Reassertion of Digital Sovereignty</h2>
            <p>The core characteristic of techno-populism is the direct linkage of <strong>technological sovereignty</strong> with the <strong>national will</strong>, using rhetoric such as "the people versus global tech oligarchs" to reassert state control over the digital sphere. This process manifests as <strong>selective sovereignty</strong>—states do not reject transnational capital wholesale, but instead filter it institutionally to ensure that technological governance serves domestic political agendas.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Hungary: In 2021, it passed <em>Act XX of 2021 on Ensuring Digital Sovereignty and Critical Infrastructure Security</em>, mandating that Meta, Google, and other transnational platforms establish local data storage centers and promoting the development of a "National Cloud" system. By 2023, this system covered 98% of public institutions, replacing AWS and Azure services. More significantly, the law granted the government <strong>algorithmic censorship powers</strong>: in 2022, Meta was fined <strong>1.8 million euros</strong> for refusing to remove political content critical of Prime Minister Orbán—marking the first legal case in which "platform content moderation" was defined as a "national security threat."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>India systematically advanced the reconstruction of digital sovereignty through its "Digital India 2.0" strategy (2021–2024). The <em>Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023</em> permits cross-border data flows but clearly defines a list of "critical data"—including Aadhaar biometric data, UPI payment records, and medical data—requiring them to be stored on domestic servers. The government simultaneously promoted the "Digital Public Infrastructure" (DPI) initiative, integrating systems such as Aadhaar (identity), UPI (payments), and DigiLocker (e-documents) into a "decolonized technological toolkit." The 2023 DPI budget reached <strong>320 billion rupees</strong> (~3.8 billion USD), serving over 1.2 billion users globally—becoming an institutional carrier of technological sovereignty.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Political Selectivity</strong>: India allows Amazon to operate but requires complete isolation of Indian user data from AWS's global network; Hungary permits Meta to remain but mandates algorithmic transparency. This shows that techno-populism is not anti-globalization, but rather a <strong>reconstruction of globalization's rules</strong> to serve national technological autonomy agendas.

            <h2>2. Economic Dimension: Populist Embeddedness and Selective Globalization</h2>
            <p>The economic foundation of techno-populism is <strong>populist embeddedness</strong>—states legitimized by "the people's interests" drive the "re-localization" of global value chains, but through <strong>politicized segmentation</strong> rather than full decoupling.</p>

            <p>In Mexico, President López Obrador launched the <em>National Nearshoring Strategy</em> (2022), offering tax exemptions (up to 5 years), land prioritization, and energy guarantees to U.S. manufacturing firms—but with three populist conditions: <strong>≥70% local employment, mandatory technology transfer, and priority procurement of local components</strong>. In 2023, Tesla's factory in Monterrey was initially blocked for failing to meet local procurement requirements, ultimately forcing the company to incorporate local battery material suppliers and restructure its supply chain. Data shows that nearshoring attracted 63% more foreign investment in 2022–2023, with <strong>82% being "conditional investments"</strong>.</p>

            <p>In Brazil, President Lula's government relaunched "reindustrialization" in 2023 through the <em>Green Industrial Plan</em> (<em>Plano Brasil Verde Industrial</em>), investing <strong>50 billion reais</strong> (~10 billion USD) to support domestic new-energy enterprises. More significantly, in 2024, it submitted <em>Draft Law 1,234/2024 on Foreign Investment Restrictions in Critical Sectors</em> to Congress, stipulating that foreign ownership in lithium, batteries, and semiconductors must not exceed 49%. CATL's proposed joint venture with a Brazilian firm stalled due to this clause, ultimately shifting to a "technology cooperation + local branding" model, abandoning majority control.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Deep Structural Shifts in Global Value Chains</strong>: From 2020 to 2023, global "nearshoring" grew by 47%, with <strong>68% of new projects flowing to countries with populist tendencies</strong> (e.g., Poland, Mexico, India). But "re-localization" is not deglobalization—it is <strong>politically embedded globalization</strong>, where states use populist narratives like "employment security" and "technological autonomy" to legitimize protectionist industrial policies.
            </div>

            <p>India's "Production Linked Incentive" (PLI) scheme (2020–2025) provides 4–6% export subsidies to domestic smartphone manufacturers, but requires the use of local components, forming a closed-loop mechanism of "local substitution—subsidy—export."</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>This process demonstrates that techno-populism is a <strong>digital variant of neo-mercantilism</strong>: states critique global capital while embedding themselves more deeply into global value chains—but on politically filtered terms.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>3. Cultural Dimension: Mnemonic Governance and the Repoliticization of Cultural Heritage</h2>
            <p>The legitimacy of techno-populism does not stem solely from sovereignty claims and industrial protectionism, but also from <strong>mnemonic governance</strong>—the state's reconstruction of historical narratives and cultural heritage to transform technological nationalism into cultural legitimacy.</p>

            <p>Poland's Law and Justice Party (PiS) revised the <em>Decommunization Act</em> in 2020, mandating the removal of communist symbols nationwide and funding the "Institute of National Remembrance" (IPN) to systematically reshape WWII narratives. The IPN simplified Poland's role as an "innocent victim," downplayed antisemitism and violence against Jewish communities, and intensified the narrative of "Soviet-Nazi collusion in oppressing Poland." In 2022, the IPN prosecuted historian Jan Gross for "defaming the nation" after his research exposed Polish civilians' participation in Jewish massacres. In 2023, the IPN's budget reached <strong>120 million zlotys</strong> (~28 million USD), accounting for 73% of national historical research funding.</p>

            <p>South Korea follows a similar logic within a "soft power" framework. President Yoon's government established the "K-Content Fund" in 2022, with a 2023 budget of <strong>20 billion won</strong> (~15 million USD), mandating that cultural content "reflect Korean values." The 2023 revision of the <em>Act on the Promotion of Cultural Content Industry</em> (Act No. 19274) authorized the government to review and restrict foreign collaborations that "distort history." A key example is Netflix's controversy with the Korean production of <em>Joseon Exorcist</em> (2021): the drama was canceled after public protests over "glorification of Chinese elements." Although the government did not directly intervene, subsequent policies reinforced the principle that "cultural content must align with national historical views." In 2024, South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism released the <em>K-Content Ethics Guidelines</em>, requiring K-pop lyrics and dramas to avoid "historical nihilism," and established a "Historical Authenticity Review Panel" including experts from the National Historical Commission.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Mnemonic Governance is Becoming Technological</strong>: In 2023, Hungary piloted a "National Memory AI" system to automatically identify and remove online content deemed to "distort national history"; in 2024, India launched a "Cultural Heritage Blockchain" to digitize and record state-recognized historical artifacts on a tamper-proof "digital orthodoxy." Culture is no longer merely an object of governance, but a <strong>source of legitimacy for technological governance</strong>.

            <h2>4. Cross-Dimensional Interaction: The Cyclical Construction of Sovereignty—Structure—Identity</h2>
            <p>The "sovereignty—structure—identity" triad is not static, but a dynamic, interlocking <strong>tricyclic system</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Digital sovereignty drives industrial selection</strong>: States restrict foreign investment in critical sectors (e.g., 5G, cloud computing) under the guise of "data security," forcing multinational companies to localize production and creating market space for domestic firms. India's ban on Huawei in 5G construction directly enabled Reliance Jio's monopoly in domestic equipment. By 2023, Jio had <strong>120 million</strong> 5G users, capturing 89% of India's 5G market.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial structure reshapes cultural identity</strong>: The rise of domestic supply chains is framed as "national technological revival," reinforcing cultural narratives. Hungary calls its domestic chip packaging plant a "guardian of the digital iron curtain," and in 2023, the government funded the documentary <em>Silicon and Sovereignty</em>, broadcast repeatedly on public TV, linking technological autonomy directly to national survival.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural identity reinforces sovereign legitimacy</strong>: Through mnemonic governance, the state constructs "techno-nationalism" as "the people's will." A 2023 Pew survey found that <strong>78% of Indians aged 18–35</strong> believe data should remain within the country, forming a closed loop of "culture—technology—politics."</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Moreover, <strong>platform governance</strong> has become the convergence point of all three dimensions: In 2023, TikTok was fined <strong>12 million euros</strong> in Hungary not only for data violations but also for "spreading non-state-approved historical content." Platforms thus become arenas of "triple governance."</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: The New Form of Global Populism and Theoretical Implications</h2>
            <p>Global practices from 2019 to 2024 demonstrate that populism has entered a <strong>systemic governance phase</strong>. Techno-populism, with "sovereignty—structure—identity" as its framework, weaves economic policy, cultural governance, and digital sovereignty into a self-reinforcing system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sovereignty</strong> has expanded from territory to digital space, forming "techno-nationalism";</li>
                <li><strong>Structure</strong> has shifted from passive integration to politicized segmentation, giving rise to "populist embeddedness";</li>
                <li><strong>Identity</strong> has evolved from abstract symbols into algorithmically governable "mnemonic governance."</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This system exists not only in mid-sized powers like Hungary and India, but also in Europe and the U.S.: the U.S. <em>CHIPS Act</em> (2022) ties semiconductor production to "American values"; the EU's <em>Digital Services Act</em> (DSA, 2022) restricts platform algorithms under the banner of "cultural diversity." The world is moving toward "multi-regime" rather than "multipolar" globalization—where states participate in globalization through divergent "populist embeddedness," forming a "parallel digital order."</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Theoretically, this framework reveals the deep institutional, economic, and cultural mechanisms of techno-populism. It is not a rebellion against modernity, but a <strong>technological response to modernity's crises</strong>: states use technology to reconstruct sovereignty, reshape structures, and rewrite identities, rebuilding order in times of turbulence.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>In the future, the evolution of techno-populism will depend on the balance of three tensions: state control versus global collaboration, local protection versus open innovation, historical memory versus future imagination. Understanding this "trinitarian" logic is the key to grasping the political and economic transformations of the 21st century.</p>
