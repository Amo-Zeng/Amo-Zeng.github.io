            <h2>Digital Sovereignty, Environmental Governance, and Human Rights Protection: Modern Challenges of Sovereign Immunity and Global Governance</h2>
            <p>With the continuous deepening of the globalization process, the traditional concept of state sovereignty is facing unprecedented challenges in various fields. Digital sovereignty in cyberspace, environmental sovereignty in global climate change, and the applicability of sovereign immunity in human rights protection have become complex issues urgently needed to be addressed by the international community. How to ensure state sovereignty while promoting global governance and responsibility sharing has become a core issue of modern international law and global governance. This article will delve into the complex relationships between digital sovereignty, environmental sovereign immunity, and human rights protection, and propose possible paths to achieve global governance under the principle of sovereign immunity.</p>

            <h3>1. Digital Sovereignty and Sovereign Immunity in Cyberspace: The Clash of Tradition and Modernity</h3>
            <p><strong>The Rise and Challenges of Digital Sovereignty</strong></p>
            <p>Digital sovereignty refers to a state's control over its digital infrastructure, data flows, and network activities within its territory. With the rapid development of the internet and digital technology, a state's actions in cyberspace are no longer merely internal affairs but increasingly affect the interests of other states. The transboundary nature of cyberspace requires states to consider the constraints of international law and the needs of global governance when exercising digital sovereignty. However, the openness and decentralization of cyberspace make regulation extremely difficult. How to protect state sovereignty while ensuring fairness and security in cyberspace has become an important topic of the digital era.</p>
            <p><strong>The Applicability of Sovereign Immunity in Cyberspace</strong></p>
            <p>The principle of sovereign immunity is an important concept in international law, aimed at protecting a state's independence and autonomy in the international community. However, with the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks, disinformation, and other behaviors, the applicability of sovereign immunity in cyberspace has been widely questioned. For example, if a state uses cyberspace to conduct offensive actions, such as hacking or spreading disinformation, should these actions still enjoy the protection of sovereign immunity? This issue has prompted profound reflection within the international community. How to protect state sovereignty while effectively curbing irresponsible actions in cyberspace has become a pressing challenge for global governance.</p>
            <p><strong>The Introduction of Restrictive Sovereign Immunity</strong></p>
            <p>To address this challenge, the international community needs to introduce the principle of restrictive sovereign immunity. This means that, in certain circumstances, a state's actions no longer enjoy absolute sovereign immunity, especially in cases of cyberattacks, violations of other states' sovereignty, or breaches of international law. By introducing restrictive sovereign immunity, the international community can respect state sovereignty while effectively curbing illegal actions in cyberspace. Additionally, establishing an international cooperation and global governance framework is crucial. By strengthening international cooperation, formulating international legal rules applicable to cyberspace, and promoting self-restraint and transparency in states' actions in cyberspace, a global governance and peaceful development in the digital era can be achieved.</p>

            <h3>2. Environmental Sovereign Immunity and Global Climate Change: The Game of Sovereignty and Responsibility</h3>
            <p><strong>The Dilemma of Environmental Sovereign Immunity</strong></p>
            <p>The principle of environmental sovereign immunity originates from the traditional concept of state sovereignty, meaning that a state's actions within its territory enjoy immunity. However, in the context of increasingly severe global climate change and transboundary environmental pollution, this principle is inadequate. For example, the large-scale deforestation or industrial emissions of a state leading to transboundary water pollution and acid rain may cause serious damage to other states. In this case, does the victim state have the right to file a lawsuit in the International Court of Justice? If sovereign immunity is invoked, can these environmental侵害 acts go unpunished?</p>
            <p><strong>The Weakening of Environmental Sovereign Immunity Under International Law</strong></p>
            <p>In recent years, the international community has conducted extensive discussions on the scope and limits of the principle of "environmental sovereign immunity." Some international conventions and judicial practices have begun to break the traditional framework of sovereign immunity, providing the possibility for transboundary environmental litigation. For example, the 1972 Stockholm Declaration on Human Environment explicitly states that "each state has the responsibility to ensure that activities within its jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other states or areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction," providing a legal basis for transboundary environmental litigation. Furthermore, the International Court of Justice, in the "Hungary v. Czech Republic" case, first recognized the principle of "prevention of environmental damage" and ruled that the Czech Republic was responsible for the environmental damage caused to Hungary, providing a precedent for transboundary environmental litigation.</p>
            <p><strong>The Future Path of Balancing Sovereignty and Responsibility</strong></p>
            <p>In the context of global climate change, how to balance respect for state sovereignty and strengthening global environmental responsibility remains a major challenge for the international community. To this end, the international community needs to improve the international environmental legal system,明确规定 the rights and obligations of states in addressing climate change and preventing transboundary pollution, and set corresponding legal responsibilities for violations. Additionally, states should strengthen cooperation and dialogue in the field of climate change, resolve disputes through negotiation, and avoid legal proceedings. Public participation and oversight are also crucial. The public is an important force in environmental governance, and its role should be fully leveraged to promote governments to fulfill their environmental protection obligations and expose and condemn violations.</p>

            <h3>3. Sovereign Immunity and Human Rights Protection: Seeking a Balance of Justice in Legal Dilemmas</h3>
            <p><strong>The Conflict Between Sovereign Immunity and Human Rights Protection</strong></p>
            <p>Within the grand framework of international law, the two principles of sovereign immunity and human rights protection seem to coexist harmoniously, yet they harbor underlying tensions. The principle of sovereign immunity aims to maintain equality among states and the stability of international relations, avoiding the intervention of one state's court in another state's sovereign actions. However, the acceleration of globalization and the increasing frequency of transnational activities have made the principle of sovereign immunity face severe challenges. When a state's government or officials are accused of committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other serious human rights violations abroad, does the victim have the right to seek justice in the International Criminal Court or other international tribunals? How to respect state sovereignty while effectively holding those who violate human rights accountable has become an urgent issue for the international community.</p>
            <p><strong>Choosing Justice in Legal Dilemmas</strong></p>
            <p>The conflict between sovereign immunity and human rights protection is essentially a contradiction between state sovereignty and international responsibility. On the one hand, state sovereignty is the foundation of international law, and respecting state sovereignty is a prerequisite for maintaining the stability of international relations; on the other hand, human rights protection is a joint responsibility of the international community, and holding accountable those who commit serious human rights violations is an inevitable requirement for maintaining international justice. In practice, the international community needs to seek a mechanism that can respect state sovereignty while effectively holding those who commit serious human rights violations accountable. For example, through extradition treaties between states, criminal judicial assistance, and the application of "universal jurisdiction" by domestic courts, the responsibility of human rights violators can be pursued without harming state sovereignty.</p>
            <p><strong>Future Outlook: Coordinating Global Governance and Human Rights Protection</strong></p>
            <p>The conflict between sovereign immunity and human rights protection will continue to exist, but the international community's pursuit of justice will not cease. With the deepening of globalization, international law is also constantly improving, and more balanced mechanisms may emerge in the future, respecting state sovereignty while more effectively protecting human rights. This requires the collective efforts of the international community. States should strengthen cooperation, build a more just and reasonable international order, to achieve harmonious coexistence between sovereignty and human rights, and let the light of justice shine on every corner of the world.</p>

            <h3>4. Conclusion: The Future of Sovereign Immunity and Global Governance</h3>
            <p>The modern challenges of digital sovereignty, environmental sovereign immunity, and human rights protection reflect the tension between traditional sovereignty concepts and global responsibilities in the context of globalization. To address these challenges, the international community needs to protect state sovereignty while promoting global governance and responsibility sharing. By introducing the principle of restrictive sovereign immunity, improving the international legal system, strengthening international cooperation and dialogue, and promoting public participation and oversight, the international community can achieve global governance in the digital era, environmental governance, and human rights protection, building a fairer, safer, and more sustainable world.</p>
