            <h2>From Data Hegemony to Data Sovereignty: Reconstructing Personal Privacy Protection Paradigms in the Digital Age</h2>
            <p>In today's world, where the digital wave is sweeping across the globe, data has become the "new oil" driving social development. However, while we enjoy the convenience of services and personalized experiences brought by data, we often overlook an important fact: we are becoming "contributors" rather than "owners" of data. Social media, web browsing, app usage, and other daily behaviors are silently recording our actions, preferences, and even privacy, ultimately transforming into profits for enterprises and tools for capital.</p>

            <h3>I. Data Hegemony and Privacy Dilemma: Dual Challenges in the Digital Age</h3>
            <p><strong>Dual Attributes of Data Portraits:</strong> Data portraits are both a technical application and a business strategy. By collecting massive amounts of data on individual online behavior, consumption records, social relationships, etc., enterprises can create accurate user portraits. While these portraits indeed play a significant role in improving service efficiency and optimizing user experience, the hidden privacy crisis cannot be ignored.</p>
            <p><strong>Privacy Dilemma in the Digital Age:</strong> With technological advancements, the concept of personal privacy is also evolving. Traditionally, privacy meant the right to personal space, but in the digital age, privacy is more about data protection rights.</p>
            <p><strong>Privacy Challenges for Vulnerable Groups:</strong> The privacy protection of vulnerable groups is facing even more significant challenges. They are more likely to become targets of privacy leakage and have fewer capabilities and avenues for privacy protection.</p>

            <h3>II. From Data Hegemony to Data Sovereignty: Reconstructing Personal Data Ownership</h3>
            <p><strong>Data Sovereignty Returns to Individuals:</strong> To change the phenomenon of "data hegemony," we must re-examine personal data ownership and redefine individuals from "data users" to "data creators."</p>
            <p><strong>Fair Distribution of Data Value:</strong> As creators of data, individuals should share the economic benefits brought by data usage.</p>
            <p><strong>Ensuring Data Privacy:</strong> The establishment of personal data ownership will effectively curb excessive data collection and misuse by enterprises, better protecting personal privacy and data security.</p>
            <p><strong>A More Equitable Data Ecosystem:</strong> The return of personal data ownership will break data monopolies, promote data circulation and sharing, and build a more equitable and open data ecosystem.</p>

            <h3>III. Building Proactive Rights for Personal Privacy Protection: Technological, Institutional, and Awareness Synergies</h3>
            <p><strong>Transparency Principle and Data Control:</strong> Transparency should be the foundation of data usage. Enterprises should provide clear explanations of data collection and usage to ensure users' rights to know and choose.</p>
            <p><strong>Technological Innovation and Privacy Protection:</strong> Technological innovation is key to achieving privacy protection. Technologies such as privacy computing, data desensitization, and blockchain can build a reliable protective barrier for personal data.</p>
            <p><strong>Strengthening Collaborative Governance for Group Privacy Protection:</strong> Protecting the "group privacy" of vulnerable groups requires multi-party collaborative governance to build a comprehensive protection system.</p>

            <h3>IV. Conclusion: From Data Hegemony to Data Sovereignty, Building a Fair, Free, and Prosperous Digital Society</h3>
            <p>From "data users" to "data creators," from "data portraits" to "data protection shields," from "individual privacy" to "group privacy," the privacy protection in the digital age requires us to rethink the relationship between individuals and data and establish people-centric data values.</p>
