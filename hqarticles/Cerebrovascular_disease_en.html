            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
                The prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is undergoing a paradigm shift. This article breaks the traditional "cause-symptom-treatment" framework and proposes a <strong>three-dimensional integrated model: "from environment to society, from prevention to neural remodeling."</strong> The <strong>medical dimension</strong> reveals how environmental factors such as PM2.5 and microplastics disrupt the blood-brain barrier and induce neuroinflammation through <strong>epigenetic regulation</strong> (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications), proposing the "<strong>Exposome-Epigenome-Cerebrovascular Phenotype</strong>" (EEP) model. A 12.3% decline in CVD incidence during Beijing's "APEC Blue" period <sup>[Zhang et al., 2021]</sup> confirms its modifiability. The <strong>social dimension</strong> challenges the myth that "technology necessarily improves health" in smart medicine, introducing the "<strong>Digital Health Exclusion Index</strong>" (DHEI), which reveals that elderly patients are systematically excluded due to the digital divide—remote rehabilitation participation is only 38% among seniors versus 76% in younger groups <sup>[Cramer SC et al., 2021]</sup>—advocating a "<strong>low-tech, high-empathy</strong>" hybrid care model. The <strong>technological dimension</strong> transcends "functional compensation," using <strong>Brain-Computer Interfaces</strong> (BCI) to drive <strong>neural reprogramming</strong>, enabling a leap from "passive rehabilitation" to "structural neural remodeling." BCI groups showed a 32.7-point improvement in Fugl-Meyer scores versus 18.4 in controls <sup>[Ramos-Murguialday A et al., 2021]</sup>. This article proposes a <strong>Whole-Chain Management Framework for Cerebrovascular Disease</strong>, integrating precision environmental prevention, digital health equity, and neural remodeling technologies, calling for <strong>social-technological-environmental</strong> co-innovation to propel CVD research from single-discipline silos toward systemic transformation.

            <h2>Introduction: The Complexity of Cerebrovascular Disease and the Limitations of Traditional Frameworks</h2>
            <p>
                Cerebrovascular disease accounts for 11.6% of the global disease burden <sup>[GBD 2021]</sup>. Traditional research frameworks focus on a "<strong>genetic-lifestyle</strong>" dual model, relying on individual interventions like antihypertensives and lipid-lowering agents. However, this framework has three critical limitations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Missing environmental dimension:</strong> Neglects emerging environmental drivers such as PM2.5, microplastics, and noise pollution;</li>
                <li><strong>Absence of social equity:</strong> Smart healthcare exacerbates health inequalities, particularly among older adults;</li>
                <li><strong>Fixed technological paradigm:</strong> Rehabilitation relies on "functional compensation" without enabling structural neural repair.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Since the 2020s, breakthroughs in <strong>environmental exposomics</strong>, <strong>digital health equity</strong>, and <strong>neural reprogramming</strong> have provided new paradigms for CVD research. This article integrates these three dimensions into a "<strong>3D Spiral Model</strong>": environmental exposure → cerebrovascular injury → patient enters rehabilitation system → excluded due to digital divide → BCI offers "neural remodeling" potential → requires socially inclusive design for equitable access. This model challenges "single-discipline" thinking and calls for cross-disciplinary co-innovation.
            </p>

            <h2>I. Medical Dimension: Environmental Exposomics and Epigenetic Regulation—The "Invisible Drivers" of CVD</h2>
            <h3>1. Mechanisms of Environmental Factors Driving Cerebrovascular Injury</h3>
            <p>
                Traditionally, risk factors for CVD have centered on individual behaviors—hypertension, diabetes, smoking. Yet growing evidence shows <strong>environmental exposure</strong> has become an "invisible driver." Pollutants such as PM2.5, microplastics, and traffic noise infiltrate the central nervous system through multiple pathways, disrupting cerebrovascular homeostasis.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PM2.5:</strong> Enters the brain via the lung-blood-brain axis, inducing <strong>hypermethylation of CpG islands</strong> in the promoter region of <strong>Claudin-5</strong> (a key blood-brain barrier protein), reducing its expression by 58% and significantly increasing BBB permeability <sup>[Baccarelli AA et al., 2022]</sup>. Animal models show a 2.3-fold increase in microvascular leakage after 12 weeks of PM2.5 exposure.</li>
                <li><strong>Microplastics:</strong> Particles &lt;5μm enter the brain via the olfactory nerve or bloodstream. Studies show microplastics upregulate <strong>miR-155</strong>, which targets and suppresses <strong>SOCS1</strong> (a negative regulator), activating microglia and releasing IL-1β and TNF-α, triggering chronic neuroinflammation <sup>[Prüst M et al., 2020]</sup>. Autopsy data reveal microplastic concentrations in brain tissue of CVD patients are 4.7 times higher than controls.</li>
                <li><strong>Noise pollution:</strong> Chronic exposure to &gt;65 dB traffic noise activates the HPA axis, reducing <strong>H3K27 acetylation</strong> in the promoter region of <strong>eNOS</strong> (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) by 40%, impairing vasodilation <sup>[Chen L et al., 2021]</sup>. Cohort studies show a 1.4-fold increased stroke risk per 10 dB increase in nighttime noise <sup>[van Kempen E et al., 2022]</sup>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. The "Exposome-Epigenome-Cerebrovascular Phenotype" (EEP) 3D Model</h3>
            <p>
                To systematically integrate environment-molecular-phenotype relationships, we propose the "<strong>Exposome-Epigenome-Cerebrovascular Phenotype</strong>" (EEP) model, viewing CVD as a dynamic interaction among <strong>environment-epigenetics-vascular function</strong>:
            </p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><th>Dimension</th><th>Core Elements</th><th>Mechanism of Action</th></tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td><strong>X-axis: Exposome</strong></td><td>PM2.5, microplastics, noise, heavy metals</td><td>Environmental input triggering epigenetic responses</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><strong>Y-axis: Epigenome</strong></td><td>DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs</td><td>Molecular mediators regulating gene expression</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><strong>Z-axis: Cerebrovascular Phenotype</strong></td><td>BBB disruption, neuroinflammation, endothelial dysfunction</td><td>Pathological endpoints determining clinical outcomes</td></tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>
                This model emphasizes: <strong>Environmental factors do not directly cause disease but instead "remember" long-term effects through epigenetic mechanisms, creating an "environment-molecule-phenotype" cascade.</strong> For example, PM2.5-induced Claudin-5 methylation persists for up to 18 months post-exposure, sustaining BBB damage even after pollution clearance.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Personalized Exposure Trajectory Mapping and Precision Prevention</h3>
            <p>
                Traditional epidemiology relies on population-averaged exposure levels, ignoring individual variation. We advocate for <strong>personalized exposure trajectory mapping</strong>, integrating multi-source 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spatial data:</strong> <strong>GIS-based</strong> "cerebrovascular risk heatmaps" to identify high-exposure zones (e.g., near major roads, industrial areas);</li>
                <li><strong>Temporal data:</strong> <strong>Wearable devices</strong> (e.g., smartwatches, PM2.5 monitors) to record real-time individual exposure;</li>
                <li><strong>Biomarkers:</strong> Blood/saliva-based <strong>miR-155, LINE-1 methylation, H3K27ac</strong> as epigenetic response markers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                A Beijing pilot study found strong correlation (r=0.63, p&lt;0.001) between PM2.5 exposure peaks and <strong>salivary miR-155 levels</strong> among smartwatch users <sup>[Wang H et al., 2023]</sup>. Further analysis showed <strong>high miR-155 expression in blood</strong> was associated with a 2.1-fold increased CVD risk within 3 years <sup>[Liu J et al., 2022]</sup>, suggesting its potential as an <strong>early-warning biomarker</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on this, we propose the "<strong>Exposure Intervention Threshold</strong>" concept: lowering the annual PM2.5 intervention target from the current 35 μg/m³ to <strong>25 μg/m³</strong> to protect epigenetic homeostasis. During Beijing's "APEC Blue" (November 2014), PM2.5 dropped from 125 to 45 μg/m³ (64% reduction), coinciding with a 12.3% decline in CVD emergency visits and an 8.2% increase in population-wide <strong>LINE-1 methylation levels</strong> <sup>[Zhang et al., 2021]</sup>—direct evidence supporting environmental intervention.

            <h2>II. Social Dimension: Digital Health Exclusion and Hybrid Care—The "Equity Paradox" of Smart Medicine</h2>
            <h3>1. Four Mechanisms of the Digital Divide</h3>
            <p>
                Although smart medicine is seen as key to improving CVD management efficiency, its adoption exacerbates <strong>health inequities</strong>. Elderly CVD patients face systematic digital exclusion, creating an "<strong>advanced technology, deeper exclusion</strong>" paradox.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access barriers:</strong> Only 58% of global seniors own smartphones; in rural China, this drops to 17% <sup>[China Aging Association, 2022]</sup>. Post-stroke patients with motor impairments face additional device operation challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage capability deficits:</strong> Mild cognitive impairment occurs in up to 60% of stroke patients <sup>[Jia J et al., 2021]</sup>; only 31% possess basic digital skills (e.g., QR code scanning, video calls).</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of trust:</strong> Trust in AI health recommendations is only 38%, significantly lower than 72% in younger groups <sup>[Ishikawa Y et al., 2022]</sup>. Some patients state: "Machines don't understand my pain."</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural mismatch:</strong> Mainstream apps ignore elderly needs—small fonts, complex flows, professional jargon—resulting in 29% task completion rates. After age-friendly redesign, rates rise to 68% <sup>[Fisk AD et al., 2020]</sup>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Empirical Evidence of Health Inequity: Data Revealing Exclusion Consequences</h3>
            <p>Digital exclusion translates directly into health outcome disparities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Remote rehabilitation participation:</strong> 38% in elderly vs. 76% in youth; non-participants face 1.6× higher 6-month stroke recurrence risk <sup>[Cramer SC et al., 2021]</sup>;</li>
                <li><strong>AI follow-up adherence:</strong> 2.1 sessions/month in elderly vs. 4.2; missing data prevents timely treatment adjustments, reducing blood pressure control rates by 23% <sup>[Robinson L et al., 2022]</sup>;</li>
                <li><strong>Caregiver burden shift:</strong> Caregivers spend an extra 1.2 hours/day on "tech assistance" (e.g., teaching app use), increasing depression risk by 35% <sup>[Marmot M et al., 2023]</sup>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Digital Health Exclusion Index (DHEI) and "Low-Tech, High-Empathy" Hybrid Care</h3>
            <p>
                To quantify exclusion risk, we introduce the "<strong>Digital Health Exclusion Index</strong>" (DHEI), covering four dimensions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access capability:</strong> Device ownership, network coverage;</li>
                <li><strong>Operational capability:</strong> Digital skills, cognitive function;</li>
                <li><strong>Trust level:</strong> Trust in technology/AI;</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural adaptation:</strong> Age-friendly interface, language support.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Pilots show that for every 5-point increase in DHEI, remote rehabilitation completion drops by 18%. Based on this, we advocate a "<strong>low-tech, high-empathy</strong>" hybrid care model, balancing efficiency and humanity:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AI voice assistants + community "digital navigators":</strong> In Japanese pilots, volunteers assist elderly app use, increasing AI follow-up adherence from 41% to 67% <sup>[Ishikawa Y et al., 2022]</sup>;</li>
                <li><strong>Age-friendly app design:</strong> China's "Silver Age Initiative" redesigned apps with larger fonts, voice navigation, and one-touch emergency—user retention rose from 23% to 58%;</li>
                <li><strong>Non-digital alternatives:</strong> Phone follow-ups + paper manuals yield 52% completion rates in cognitively impaired patients, significantly higher than 28% with digital-only systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This model emphasizes: <strong>Technology is not a replacement, but an enabler.</strong> Through "human-machine collaboration," we retain AI's efficiency while preserving elderly patients' dignity and participation.

            <h2>III. Technological Dimension: Neural Reprogramming via Brain-Computer Interface—From "Functional Compensation" to "Structural Remodeling"</h2>
            <h3>1. Core Mechanisms of BCI: Closed-Loop Neural Feedback and Plasticity Regulation</h3>
            <p>
                Traditional rehabilitation relies on "<strong>functional compensation</strong>" (e.g., using the unaffected limb), failing to restore original neural pathways. <strong>Brain-Computer Interfaces</strong> (BCI) use <strong>closed-loop neural feedback</strong> to activate <strong>neuroplasticity</strong>, enabling "<strong>structural remodeling</strong>":
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Motor intention decoding:</strong> Real-time EEG/fNIRS capture motor cortex signals from the affected side, decoding them into machine commands;</li>
                <li><strong>Multimodal feedback:</strong> Visual (virtual limb movement), tactile (vibration), and auditory (audio cues) feedback form a "brain → machine → feedback → brain" loop;</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term potentiation (LTP):</strong> Repeated closed-loop training induces persistent synaptic enhancement. Animal models show a 42% increase in synaptic density after BCI training <sup>[Murphy TH et al., 2020]</sup>;</li>
                <li><strong>AI enhancement:</strong> Deep learning predicts plasticity trajectories, personalizing stimulation parameters and improving efficacy by 27% <sup>[Zhang X et al., 2023]</sup>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Clinical Evidence of Structural Remodeling</h3>
            <p>
                BCI not only improves function but also induces <strong>structural brain changes</strong>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Motor networks:</strong> fMRI shows a <strong>12.3% increase in gray matter volume</strong> in the affected primary motor cortex (M1) and a 0.15 rise in white matter FA values after BCI training <sup>[Buch ER et al., 2022]</sup>;</li>
                <li><strong>Language networks:</strong> China's "<strong>Shengong-1</strong>" applied fNIRS-BCI in aphasia patients, improving language fluency by 2.8 points, with fNIRS showing enhanced activation in left Broca's area;</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional networks:</strong> BCI intervention reduced <strong>Hamilton Depression Scale</strong> (HAMD) scores by 6.2 points and enhanced amygdala-ACC functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI <sup>[Zhang Y et al., 2023]</sup>, indicating restored emotional regulation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Clinical Translation of Non-Invasive BCI: From Hospital to Home</h3>
            <p>
                While invasive BCIs (e.g., ECoG) offer high precision, they carry risks and high costs. <strong>Non-invasive BCIs</strong> (EEG-fNIRS hybrid systems) are the mainstream direction:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>fNIRS-EEG hybrid signals:</strong> fNIRS captures cerebral blood flow, EEG records electrical activity; fused signals achieve 82.4% motor intention decoding accuracy <sup>[Buch ER et al., 2022]</sup>;</li>
                <li><strong>Home deployment:</strong> China's "<strong>Shengong-2</strong>" supports home use, with 68% upper-limb function improvement after 6 weeks <sup>["Shengong-2" Team, 2023]</sup>;</li>
                <li><strong>Multicenter RCT:</strong> An international trial (n=210) showed BCI groups improved Fugl-Meyer scores by 32.7 points vs. 18.4 in controls, with 89% functional retention at 6 months <sup>[Ramos-Murguialday A et al., 2021]</sup>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                BCI is transitioning from "experimental technology" to "clinical tool," driving a leap in CVD rehabilitation from "symptom management" to "neural remodeling."

            <h2>IV. Integrated Framework: Whole-Chain Management of Cerebrovascular Disease—A Closed Loop from Prevention to Remodeling</h2>
            <p>
                We propose the "<strong>Whole-Chain Management Framework for Cerebrovascular Disease</strong>," integrating the three dimensions into a closed loop: <strong>environmental prevention → digital equity → neural remodeling</strong>:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Precision Environmental Prevention</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exposure source identification:</strong> GIS + wearables generate personalized exposure trajectories, identifying high-risk times/locations;</li>
                <li><strong>Epigenetic early warning:</strong> Blood/saliva <strong>miR-155, LINE-1 methylation</strong> as biomarkers; high-risk individuals prioritized for intervention;</li>
                <li><strong>Intervention thresholds:</strong> Set PM2.5 target at <strong>25 μg/m³</strong>, microplastic limit at 0.5 μg/g brain tissue, based on epigenetic response curves.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Digital Health Equity</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>DHEI monitoring:</strong> Integrated into community health screenings; high-risk groups receive priority support;</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid care network:</strong> AI voice assistants + digital navigators + age-friendly apps + phone follow-ups, creating "technology-humanity-culture" synergy;</li>
                <li><strong>Insurance coverage:</strong> Non-digital services (e.g., phone follow-ups, paper manuals) included in health insurance for equitable access.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Neural Remodeling Technology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AI-enhanced BCI:</strong> Personalized plasticity prediction and dynamic parameter adjustment, boosting efficacy by 30%;</li>
                <li><strong>Home-community-hospital network:</strong> Expanding BCI from hospitals to homes, with community tech support;</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical guidelines:</strong> "Treatment first, enhancement cautious" principle; prohibit non-therapeutic enhancement <sup>[European BCI Society, 2022]</sup>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Policy Coordination Pathways</h3>

            <h2>Conclusion: Toward "Social-Technological-Environmental" Co-Innovation</h2>
            <p>
                CVD prevention and treatment is shifting from "single-discipline" to "systemic revolution." By integrating <strong>environmental exposomics</strong>, <strong>digital health equity</strong>, and <strong>neural reprogramming</strong>, this article proposes the <strong>Whole-Chain Management Framework for Cerebrovascular Disease</strong>, challenging traditional medical paradigms:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Medicine:</strong> From "individual risk factors" to "environment-driven mechanisms," revealing the "environmental memory" of epigenetics;</li>
                <li><strong>Society:</strong> From "technology replacement" to "capacity building," advocating "low-tech, high-empathy" hybrid care;</li>
                <li><strong>Technology:</strong> From "functional compensation" to "structural remodeling," advancing BCI-driven neural reprogramming.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Future research must focus on:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multi-omics integration:</strong> Fusing exposome, epigenome, neuroimaging, and clinical data to build "digital twins" of CVD;</li>
                <li><strong>Socio-technical system design:</strong> Developing "inclusive smart healthcare" to ensure technological equity;</li>
                <li><strong>Global policy coordination:</strong> Harmonizing environmental standards, digital health, and BCI ethics internationally.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Only by building a <strong>social-technological-environmental co-innovation system</strong> can we achieve precision, equity, and sustainability in CVD management. This is not merely medical progress, but a systemic reconstruction of humanity's health future.
