            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>jQuery, a JavaScript library born in 2006, was once the standard tool for front-end development, greatly simplifying DOM manipulation and event handling with its concise syntax, powerful selectors, and cross-browser compatibility. However, as modern front-end frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular have risen, jQuery's dominance has been challenged. This article will delve into the historical legacy and modern challenges, adaptability and maintenance of legacy projects, educational value and the importance of foundational knowledge, comparison with native JavaScript, and plugin development and application practices, to explore the role and future of jQuery in modern front-end development.</p>

            <h3>Historical Legacy and Modern Challenges</h3>
            <p>jQuery, with its concise syntax and powerful features, was once a sharp tool in the hands of web developers. However, as modern front-end development focuses more on componentization and modularity, jQuery's position has been challenged. Modern front-end frameworks enhance application performance and maintainability through concepts like virtual DOM, unidirectional data flow, and state management. In contrast, while jQuery remains efficient in simple DOM operations and basic functionalities, it struggles with the construction of complex applications.</p>

            <h3>Adaptability and Maintenance of Legacy Projects</h3>
            <p>Despite facing modern challenges, jQuery has not been completely phased out. Many businesses and projects still rely on jQuery-built legacy systems. These systems, after years of iteration, have formed a large and complex codebase. Migrating entirely to new frameworks is not only costly but also risky. Therefore, maintaining and upgrading these legacy projects has become an important reason for jQuery's continued existence. jQuery's adaptability lies in its ability to find its niche in different technologies and frameworks. It can act as a bridge between old and new technologies, helping developers transition gradually to new development models. Meanwhile, jQuery's plugin ecosystem remains rich, with many commonly used UI components and tools still relying on jQuery, providing possibilities for its application in specific scenarios.</p>

            <h3>Educational Value and Importance of Foundational Knowledge</h3>
            <p>In the field of front-end education, jQuery still holds an important position. Its clear and straightforward API and intuitive operation make it an excellent entry point for beginners to understand front-end fundamentals. By learning jQuery, newcomers can quickly grasp core concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and Ajax, laying a solid foundation for subsequent learning of more advanced frameworks. However, as front-end technology evolves rapidly, education也在不断进化. Modern front-end courses place more emphasis on introducing frameworks and toolchains, as well as cultivating programming思维 and design patterns. In this process, the role of jQuery may gradually shift from a primary teaching tool to a supplementary one, helping students better understand the core principles of front-end development.</p>

            <h3>Comparison Between jQuery and Native JavaScript</h3>
            <p>jQuery has a clear advantage in syntax simplicity and learning curve, while native JavaScript excels in performance and flexibility. jQuery is renowned for its concise syntax, greatly reducing the coding burden for developers through chaining calls and simplified selectors. For example, to hide an element, jQuery only requires one line of code:</p>
            <pre><code>javascript
$("selector").hide();
</code></pre>
            <p>In contrast, native JavaScript's syntax is more low-level and detailed, requiring more code:</p>
            <pre><code>javascript
document.querySelector("selector").style.display = "none";
</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>jQuery Plugin Development and Application Practices</h3>
            <p>In modern web development, jQuery, as a concise and efficient front-end library, greatly simplifies HTML document traversal, event handling, animation, and Ajax interaction. As project complexity increases, developers often need to encapsulate reusable functional modules—jQuery plugins. An effective jQuery plugin architecture should adhere to principles of modularity, single responsibility, extensibility, and configurability. A typical plugin structure includes plugin definition, initialization, core functionality implementation, and optional event handling. For example:</p>
            <pre><code>javascript
(function($) {
    $.fn.myPlugin = function(options) {
        var settings = $.extend({
            // Default parameters
        }, options);

        return this.each(function() {
            // Plugin core logic
        });
    };
}(jQuery));
</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Overall, although jQuery's role in modern front-end development has been challenged, it still plays an important role in specific fields and scenarios. For the maintenance of legacy projects, jQuery's stability and maturity are irreplaceable. In the field of education, it remains a powerful tool for imparting foundational knowledge. Looking ahead, as front-end technology continues to evolve, jQuery may gradually recede into the background, but its historical legacy and educational value will long influence the front-end development community. jQuery and native JavaScript each have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on the developer's needs and project characteristics. Through comprehensive practices, developers can create powerful and user-friendly plugins, driving the development and innovation of web applications.</p>
