                <li><strong>Target Identification and Drug Design</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>AI identifies potential drug targets by analyzing vast amounts of data. Through deep learning and reinforcement learning, AI can simulate and generate new molecular structures, predict their efficacy, toxicity, and metabolic properties, thereby optimizing drug design.</li>
                        <li><strong>Drug Repurposing</strong>: AI algorithms can explore new uses for existing drugs, significantly reducing development time and costs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Intelligent Clinical Trials</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>AI can analyze patient data to design more precise clinical trials, enhancing success rates. Additionally, natural language processing extracts valuable information from literature to support in-depth research.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

        <section>
            <h3>Deep Implementation of Patient-Centered Drug Development</h3>
            <p>Patient-centered drug development emphasizes transforming patients from passive recipients of treatment to active participants:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increased Engagement</strong>: Patients are involved from trial design to outcome evaluation, providing real-world feedback to ensure drug design meets actual needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Support</strong>: Big data and AI technologies promote personalized medicine, while telemedicine and mobile health technologies make it easier for patients to participate in studies.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethics and Regulations</strong>: Ensuring informed consent and data privacy while adapting to evolving regulations to protect patient rights.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Drug Development from an Ecosystem Perspective</h3>
            <p>The ecosystem concept introduces new perspectives and methods to drug development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biodiversity</strong>: Nature's biodiversity serves as a treasure trove for new drug resources, and protecting ecosystems ensures the sustainability of drug ingredients.</li>
