            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Neutrons, as fundamental components of atomic nuclei, not only reveal the basic structure of matter but also demonstrate wide potential applications in cutting-edge scientific fields. This article will explore the multidimensional study of neutrons from three perspectives: dark matter detection, the extreme physical phenomena of neutron stars, and applications in nuclear medicine, highlighting their significant roles in cosmology, astrophysics, and medicine.</p>

            <h3>I. The Potential Role of Neutrons in Dark Matter Detection</h3>
            <p><strong>Principles and Experimental Design of Neutron Recoil Detection</strong></p>
            <p>Neutron recoil detection utilizes the elastic collision between dark matter particles (such as WIMPs) and nucleons within a detector to record the energy of the recoil, thereby inferring the mass and interaction strength of the dark matter particles. Detector materials like liquid xenon, germanium, and sodium iodide crystals are chosen for their high nucleon density, which increases the probability of collision with dark matter particles. In experimental design, techniques such as shielding, pulse shape discrimination, and recoil energy spectrum analysis are used to differentiate background noise from dark matter signals. For example, deep underground laboratories can significantly reduce cosmic ray interference, while photomultiplier tubes or cryogenic detectors can capture faint recoil signals. These technologies make neutron recoil detection a crucial method in dark matter research, offering new insights into the nature of dark matter and its interactions with ordinary matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Theoretical Foundations of Low-Temperature Neutron Scattering Experiments and Their Applications in Dark Matter Detection</strong></p>
            <p>Low-temperature neutron scattering experiments are based on quantum mechanics' Bloch's theorem and Fermi liquid theory. Neutron scattering at low temperatures can reveal structural and dynamic information about materials. Bloch's theorem describes the neutron wavefunction within a lattice, while Fermi liquid theory explains the collective behavior of neutrons at low temperatures. Cryogenic detectors can capture extremely low-energy recoil signals, enabling the detection of light dark matter particles. This not only enhances detection sensitivity but also reduces false positives, providing more accurate identification of dark matter signals. The application of low-temperature neutron scattering experiments expands the detection scope and, through precise experimental design and theoretical analysis, reduces uncertainties in detection. This approach is significant for understanding the essence of dark matter and provides new directions for future dark matter research.</p>
