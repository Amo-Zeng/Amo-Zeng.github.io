            <h3>The Subtle Connection Between Neutrons and Dark Matter</h3>
            <p>Dark matter, which accounts for about 85% of the total mass of the universe, has long been a puzzle that physicists are eager to solve. Neutrons, as electrically neutral elementary particles, are ideal tools for detecting dark matter due to their neutral charge. Their interactions with dark matter provide scientists with a window for indirect detection.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Neutron Scattering:</strong> One of the important methods for detecting dark matter, by measuring the changes in neutron beams after passing through matter, to infer the existence of dark matter.</li>
                <li><strong>Neutron Stars:</strong> May contain large amounts of dark matter inside. Studying the properties of neutron stars may provide important clues about the existence of dark matter.</li>
                <li><strong>Neutron Decay:</strong> May release dark matter particles during the process, opening up new experimental avenues for dark matter research.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although neutron detection of dark matter has the advantages of high sensitivity, low background noise, and wide applicability, it still relies on more advanced neutron detection technologies and well-developed dark matter theoretical models.</p>

            <h3>The Matter State Inside Neutron Stars: Beyond Conventional Physics</h3>
            <p>Neutron stars, as one of the most extreme objects in the universe, have a matter state inside that exceeds our traditional understanding of matter. Under densities of tens of millions of tons per cubic centimeter, the matter inside neutron stars has broken through the boundaries of classical physics, entering deeper realms of quantum mechanics and relativity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Neutron Degenerate Matter:</strong> Dominated by the Pauli exclusion principle, forming ultra-dense structures similar to atomic nuclei.</li>
                <li><strong>Superfluid and Superconductor:</strong> Theoretical speculation suggests that these exotic states of matter may exist inside neutron stars.</li>
                <li><strong>Quark-Gluon Plasma:</strong> In the core regions of neutron stars, matter may further decompose into quarks and gluons, exhibiting new physical properties.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The matter state of neutron stars not only provides a unique platform for the study of the nature of matter but also poses serious challenges to gravitational theory.</p>
