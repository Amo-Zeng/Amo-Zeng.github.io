            <ol>
                <li><strong>Challenges in Liability Determination:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Algorithm Black Box: The complexity and opacity of AI algorithms make explanations and accountability difficult.</li>
                        <li>Multiple Responsible Parties: Designers, trainers, and users of AI systems may all become responsible parties, increasing the complexity of liability determination.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Security Risks:</strong>
                    <ul>

            <h3>2. From Individual Justice to Collective Justice: Social Equity Issues in Medical Disputes</h3>
            <p>Traditional medical dispute resolution mechanisms tend to pursue "individual justice," i.e., determining responsibilities and compensation through legal means for the involved parties. However, this model has obvious limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ignoring the Uncertainty of Medical Actions:</strong> Medical actions are highly professional and uncertain, and many medical disputes are not due to doctors' subjective faults but rather the limitations of medicine or patients' own factors.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Consideration for Fair Distribution of Medical Resources:</strong> Unequal distribution of medical resources is one of the significant causes of medical disputes.</li>
                <li><strong>Not Conducive to the Harmonious Development of Doctor-Patient Relations:</strong> Overemphasis on "individual justice" can easily place doctors and patients in opposition, weakening mutual trust and hindering the construction of harmonious doctor-patient relationships.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The shift from "individual justice" to "collective justice" means we need to move beyond the simple "victim-perpetrator" mindset and examine medical disputes in a broader social context, focusing on the underlying social equity issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fair Distribution of Medical Resources:</strong> Governments should increase investment in primary healthcare institutions, promoting the decentralization of high-quality medical resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement of Medical Risk Sharing Mechanisms:</strong> Establishing and improving medical risk-sharing mechanisms to integrate medical disputes into the social security system.</li>
                <li><strong>Diversification of Medical Dispute Resolution Mechanisms:</strong> In addition to legal channels, encouraging the establishment of third-party mediation mechanisms.</li>
            </ul>
