            <h3>1. Need for Cross-Platform Real-Time Data Synchronization</h3>
            <p>With the proliferation of mobile devices, desktop computers, and cloud services, users require real-time synchronization and updating of data across different devices, such as schedules, notes, or photos. This synchronization must be fast and ensure data security and privacy. Traditional synchronization mechanisms often rely on platform-specific APIs or protocols, lacking flexibility and universality across platforms.</p>

            <h3>11. Application of Zero-Knowledge Proof in Socket Programming</h3>
            <p>Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic technique that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any information about the statement itself. In Socket Programming, Zero-Knowledge Proof can be used to verify data integrity and authenticity without exposing the data's content.</p>
