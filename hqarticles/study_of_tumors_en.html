            <h2>From Environment to Immunotherapy: The Future of Cancer Prevention through Interdisciplinary Approaches</h2>
            <p>The development of oncology faces multiple challenges, including early diagnosis, precision treatment, and the formulation of personalized medical plans. With technological advancements, interdisciplinary research has become a significant force in pushing oncology forward. The deep integration of fields like computer science and artificial intelligence (AI), environmental science, and immunology not only enhances the diagnosis and treatment of cancer but also provides new perspectives and strategies for its prevention and control.</p>

            <h3>I. Applications of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in Oncology</h3>
            <p><strong>Big Data Analysis</strong> provides rich resources for oncology research. By analyzing genomic data, clinical data, and lifestyle data from global patients, researchers can identify specific risk factors and patterns of treatment response. For example, genomic data analysis can predict which genetic mutations are associated with specific types of cancer, thereby tailoring personalized treatment plans. The integration of electronic health records (EHR) makes it possible to track disease progression, predict treatment outcomes, and identify complications.</p>
            <p><strong>Machine Learning</strong> also has significant applications in oncology. Through time-series data and machine learning models, scientists can predict tumor growth rates, spread paths, and responses to treatments. Deep learning models learn tumor characteristics from medical imaging like CT scans, predicting their future changes. Additionally, machine learning is used to predict patient responses to specific treatment regimens, reducing unnecessary treatments and side effects.</p>
            <p><strong>Image Recognition Technology</strong> plays a crucial role in improving early cancer detection rates. AI algorithms can quickly analyze various medical images, automatically identifying potential tumor areas, reducing the workload of radiologists, and increasing the sensitivity and specificity of diagnoses. Similarly, through deep learning, AI can assist pathologists in identifying minute tumor cells or precancerous lesions.</p>

            <h3>II. The Impact of Environment and Lifestyle on Cancer Development</h3>
            <p>Environmental factors and lifestyle are not just external influences on health; they also directly or indirectly participate in cancer development through regulating gene expression. Factors like <strong>air pollution</strong>, <strong>water pollution</strong>, and <strong>climate change</strong> can lead to genetic mutations and cancer formation. For example, airborne particulate matter (PM2.5) and heavy metals enter the body through respiration, increasing the incidence of cancers like lung cancer.</p>
            <p><strong>Dietary habits</strong>, <strong>physical activity</strong>, and <strong>sleep quality</strong> are lifestyle factors closely related to cancer development. Dietary patterns vary significantly across different cultural backgrounds; for instance, the high-fat, high-red meat Western diet is linked to colorectal cancer rates, while the Mediterranean diet is thought to help prevent various cancers. Exercise and good sleep habits can promote metabolism, boost immune system function, and reduce chronic inflammation levels, thereby lowering cancer risk.</p>

            <h3>III. Innovations in Cancer Immunotherapy</h3>
            <p>In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of cancer immunotherapy, with the understanding and manipulation of the <strong>tumor microenvironment</strong> (TME) being focal points. Tumor cells evade immune surveillance through mechanisms like immune suppression, immune escape, and recruiting immunosuppressive cells. To combat these mechanisms, scientists have developed various novel immunotherapy approaches:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CAR-T Cell Therapy</strong> has been refined through target selection, CAR structure improvement, and in vivo CAR-T technology, enhancing both safety and efficacy of treatments.</li>
                <li><strong>Bispecific Antibodies</strong> simultaneously bind to tumor cells and immune cells, guiding immune cells to directly attack tumors.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized Vaccines</strong> and <strong>Tumor Mutation Burden Vaccines</strong> use tumor-specific antigens to activate the immune system's attack on cancer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the future, combining <strong>genomics</strong>, <strong>single-cell RNA sequencing</strong>, and <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, cancer immunotherapy will become more personalized and precise. The combination of multiple immunotherapies will become mainstream to overcome potential resistance issues encountered with single therapies. Nanotechnology and gene-editing technologies will also provide new tools to advance immunotherapy.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Interdisciplinary research has shown tremendous potential in oncology. From the application of computer science and AI to enhance diagnostic accuracy, to in-depth studies on environmental and lifestyle impacts, to innovations in immunotherapy, each field provides new ideas and methods for cancer prevention and treatment. Future interdisciplinary collaborations will further drive progress in oncology research, achieving more efficient and personalized treatment plans, improving survival rates and quality of life for patients. By comprehensively utilizing these technologies and knowledge, we hope to achieve comprehensive control over cancer, moving towards a new era in medicine.</p>
