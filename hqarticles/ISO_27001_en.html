            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the global wave of digital transformation, information security has become a core element for the survival and development of enterprises. ISO 27001, as an internationally recognized standard for information security management systems, not only provides organizations with a framework to address complex security challenges but also demonstrates its unique strategic value in digital transformation, sustainability, and the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. This article will delve into the applications of ISO 27001 in these areas, and analyze its importance and effectiveness through practical examples.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>1. Background and Core Value of ISO 27001</h2>
            <p>ISO 27001 is a globally recognized standard for information security management systems, aimed at helping organizations establish, implement, maintain, and continuously improve their Information Security Management System (ISMS). Its core value lies in providing a systematic risk management approach, ensuring that an organization's critical information assets are properly protected. Through systematic risk assessment and management processes, ISO 27001 not only helps organizations address security challenges in digital transformation but also supports their strategic positioning in the context of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the AI field.</p>

            <h2>2. The Role of ISO 27001 in Digital Transformation</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Systematization of Risk Management</h3>
            <p>During digital transformation, the risks faced by organizations become more diverse and complex. ISO 27001 provides a systematic risk assessment and management process, helping organizations identify, analyze, and address potential security threats. This not only ensures data security but also provides a solid foundation for the organization's continuous development.</p>
            <h3>2.2 Building Trust and Compliance</h3>
            <p>Digital transformation increases the frequency of data exchange between organizations and their customers and partners. ISO 27001 certification is not only a testament to an organization's capability in information security management but also an important means of building and maintaining customer trust. Additionally, it helps organizations meet increasingly stringent legal and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR.</p>
            <h3>2.3 Supporting Business Innovation and Flexibility</h3>
            <p>The continuous improvement mechanism emphasized by ISO 27001 allows organizations to remain flexible and adaptable in a constantly changing technological environment. This enables organizations to safely explore new business models and technologies, thereby maintaining a competitive edge in digital transformation.</p>

            <h2>3. The Connection Between ISO 27001 and Sustainable Development Goals</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Enhancing Governance Capabilities</h3>
            <p>ISO 27001 requires organizations to establish robust governance structures and processes to ensure the consistency and effectiveness of information security management. This directly enhances the governance capabilities of organizations, providing a foundation for building a more just and secure society.</p>
            <h3>3.2 Reducing Information Leakage Risks</h3>
            <p>By implementing ISO 27001, organizations can effectively identify and control potential information security risks, reducing the occurrence of information leakage incidents. This not only protects the interests of the organization itself but also safeguards the sensitive data of customers and partners, maintaining overall societal interests.</p>
            <h3>3.3 Protecting Sensitive Data</h3>
            <p>In the digital age, protecting sensitive data is particularly important. ISO 27001 ensures that sensitive data is not misused or leaked through strict data management processes and security controls, which is crucial for maintaining social justice and public safety.</p>

            <h2>4. The Application of ISO 27001 in the AI and Machine Learning Field</h2>
            <h3>4.1 Security Assessment of AI Models</h3>
            <p>ISO 27001 requires organizations to identify, assess, and manage information security risks. In the AI and machine learning field, this means conducting security assessments of AI models to ensure they do not become entry points for attacks. Organizations can develop specific assessment processes to verify the robustness of models and their resistance to malicious inputs.</p>
            <h3>4.2 Data Privacy Protection</h3>
            <p>ISO 27001 emphasizes the protection of personal data, which is particularly important in AI and machine learning environments as these technologies often require large amounts of personal data to train and optimize models. Organizations can implement measures such as encryption, data anonymization, and access control to protect personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse.</p>
            <h3>4.3 Risk Management</h3>
            <p>Risk management for AI systems is a key component of the ISO 27001 framework. Organizations need to identify potential risks associated with AI and machine learning applications, including data breaches, model bias, and risk of erroneous decision-making, and develop corresponding mitigation strategies.</p>
