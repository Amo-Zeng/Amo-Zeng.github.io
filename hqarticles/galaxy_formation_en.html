            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The universe is a magnificent and complex system where galaxies, as its fundamental structural units, reveal the deep mysteries of the cosmos through their formation and evolution. In this process, dark matter, intergalactic collisions and mergers, and the environment in which galaxies reside play crucial roles. This article will explore how these factors interact to shape the cosmic landscape we see today.</p>

            <h3>The Central Role of Dark Matter</h3>
            <p>Although dark matter is invisible, its gravitational effects are the cornerstone of galaxy formation and evolution. By providing a "gravitational framework," dark matter allows ordinary matter to aggregate, forming the initial structures of galaxies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gravitational Framework:</strong> Dark matter halos not only surround galaxies but also determine their shape and stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Interaction:</strong> Dark matter might weakly interact with ordinary matter, influencing the efficiency of star formation during galaxy mergers.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Galaxy Mergers and Innovative Models</h3>
            <p>The collisions and mergers of galaxies are not just major events in galaxy evolution but also provide a unique perspective on the formation of cosmic structures.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Matter Reorganization and New Star Formation:</strong> During mergers, the mixing and compression of gas might trigger the formation of new stars.</li>
                <li><strong>Unique Celestial Phenomena:</strong> Mergers can lead to dual activity of supermassive black holes, the formation of new stellar populations, or the creation of "dead zones" at the centers of galaxies.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Galaxy Evolution Driven by Environment</h3>
            <p>The external environment of a galaxy also profoundly affects its formation and evolution.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pressure in Galaxy Clusters:</strong> In high-density environments, the hot gas pressure of galaxy clusters can strip gas from within galaxies.</li>
                <li><strong>Material Flow in the Cosmic Web:</strong> Galaxies can absorb cold gas through the filamentary structures of the cosmic web, promoting star formation.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Formation of Cosmic Structures from a Comprehensive Perspective</h3>
            <p>Overall, dark matter, galaxy mergers, and environmental influences together form a dynamic system for galaxy formation and evolution:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Gravitational Framework and Dynamic Interaction:</strong> The gravitational effects of dark matter provide stability and shape to galaxies.</li>
                <li><strong>Mergers and Innovative Phenomena:</strong> Galaxy mergers are not merely a redistribution of matter but also a laboratory for cosmic physical processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Effects:</strong> The environment in which a galaxy is located determines different paths and speeds of its evolution.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The formation and evolution of galaxies are complex processes influenced by multiple factors. By deeply studying dark matter, analyzing innovative models of galaxy mergers, and exploring environmental influences, we can better understand the past and present of galaxies, and predict their future evolutionary trends.</p>
