            <h2>Prefabricated Buildings Driven by Digital Twin Technology: Whole Life Cycle Cost Optimization and Sustainable Economic Models</h2>
            <p>In the context of global climate change and accelerated urbanization, the construction industry is facing unprecedented challenges and opportunities. How to achieve a win-win situation for economic and environmental benefits during this transformation process has become a focus of the industry. This article explores how, driven by digital twin technology, prefabricated and modular construction (PMC) can promote the green transformation of the construction industry through whole life cycle cost optimization and the construction of sustainable economic models.</p>

            <h3>I. Limitations of Traditional Building Economic Analysis and the Introduction of Carbon Pricing Mechanisms</h3>
            <p>Traditional building economic analysis often focuses on explicit financial costs, ignoring implicit environmental costs, leading to the prevalence of high-energy-consumption and high-pollution construction schemes. To change this situation, introducing carbon pricing mechanisms, incorporating carbon emissions costs into various stages such as building materials, construction, and operation and maintenance, not only quantifies implicit environmental costs but also guides investors and developers to choose more environmentally friendly and sustainable construction schemes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Energy Consumption and High Pollution</strong>: Due to the lack of carbon pricing, carbon emissions generated during the production of building materials, energy consumption in construction, and energy use during building operation are not included in cost accounting. As a result, high-energy-consumption and high-pollution construction schemes, which have lower initial costs, are favored, further exacerbating global climate change issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Waste and Ecological Damage</strong>: The mining, processing, and transportation of building materials often involve excessive resource consumption and ecological damage. The lack of carbon pricing mechanisms means these implicit costs cannot be reflected in the economic analysis of buildings, leading to a vicious cycle of resource waste and ecological damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Neglect of Social Costs</strong>: Environmental pollution from construction activities not only directly affects ecosystems but also indirectly impacts human health and social welfare. Social costs related to air pollution, water pollution, and noise pollution are also overlooked by traditional building economic analysis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Economic Benefit Assessment of Prefabricated and Modular Buildings</h3>
            <p>Prefabricated buildings involve pre-manufacturing building components in factory environments and then assembling them on-site; modular buildings involve pre-manufacturing entire building units (modules) in factories and then transporting them to the site for rapid installation. PMC has been widely applied worldwide, but its economic benefits still lack systematic evaluation and analysis. This article constructs a comprehensive assessment model to compare PMC with traditional buildings in terms of cost, project duration, quality, environmental impact, and other dimensions, and explores the applicability of different types of projects (residential, commercial, public buildings) to provide a scientific basis for policy formulation and market promotion.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost Analysis</strong>: Compare the cost differences between PMC and traditional buildings in material procurement, processing, and transportation.</li>
                <li><strong>Labor Cost</strong>: Analyze the changes in labor costs during factory production and on-site assembly of PMC.</li>
                <li><strong>Equipment and Tool Costs</strong>: Evaluate the investment costs of specialized equipment and tools required for PMC.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Project Duration Evaluation</strong>: Compare the pre-manufacturing cycle of PMC in factories with the design and construction cycle of traditional buildings.</li>
                <li><strong>On-Site Construction Duration</strong>: Analyze the time difference between on-site assembly of PMC and construction time of traditional buildings.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quality Control</strong>: Discuss how standardized production in factories improves building quality.</li>
                <li><strong>On-Site Quality Control</strong>: Evaluate potential quality issues and solutions during the on-site assembly of PMC.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Impact</strong>: Compare the carbon emissions of PMC and traditional buildings throughout their life cycles.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Utilization Efficiency</strong>: Analyze the environmental benefits of PMC in material utilization and waste management.</li>
            </ul>
