            <h2>The "Invisible" Revolution in Optical Communication: From Visible Light to Invisible Light</h2>
            <p>Since its inception, optical communication technology has been continuously evolving, from the initial visible light communication (such as optical fibers) to the current exploration of new fields of invisible light communication. This "invisible" revolution not only expands the application scenarios of optical communication but also brings new possibilities for future communication networks. This article will explore how optical communication technology has expanded from traditional visible light communication to invisible light communication, and analyze the advantages and disadvantages, application scenarios, and future development trends of different wavelength optical communication technologies.</p>
