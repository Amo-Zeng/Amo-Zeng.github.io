            <h2>Anomalies: The Starting Point of Theoretical Advancement</h2>
            <p>Throughout the history of scientific exploration, anomalies have consistently played a pivotal role in driving theoretical evolution. These phenomena, which do not align with existing theoretical frameworks, not only reveal the limitations of scientific knowledge but also serve as crucial catalysts for self-correction and innovation in science.</p>

            <h3>The Emergence of Anomalies: Limitations of Theory</h3>
            <p>The emergence of anomalies often signifies the limitations of current theories. They are like stones thrown into a still lake, creating ripples that push scientists to re-examine and revise their theoretical systems. For example, the "ultraviolet catastrophe" in the blackbody radiation problem, which could not be explained by classical physics, eventually led to the birth of quantum mechanics in the late 19th century.</p>

            <h3>Anomalies and the Information Paradox: Challenges in Quantum World</h3>
            <p>In the realm of quantum physics, anomalies are deeply connected to the information paradox. Anomalous phenomena such as quantum entanglement, superposition states, and measurement issues reveal that the behavior of quantum systems often defies intuition, challenging classical physics' understanding of information transfer and causality.</p>

            <h3>Anomalies and Dark Matter: A New Perspective in Cosmology</h3>
            <p>In cosmology, observations of anomalies often serve as opportunities to break through traditional theories. In the 1930s, Fritz Zwicky observed the movement speeds of galaxy clusters and first proposed the problem of "missing mass," suggesting the existence of some undetected substance.</p>

            <h3>The Future of Anomalies: New Directions in Scientific Exploration</h3>
            <p>Anomalies are not only the starting point of theoretical progress but also new directions for scientific exploration. From quantum physics to cosmology, anomalies span multiple cutting-edge fields, driving continuous evolution of scientific theories.</p>
