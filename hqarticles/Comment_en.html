        <h2>Comments as a Power Interface: A Tripartite Critique of Cognitive Colonization, Affective Engineering, and Memory Competition</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <p>In an era where digital media are deeply embedded in social structures, “comments” have evolved far beyond mere textual appendages or emotional outbursts—they now function as a multidimensional <span class="highlight">interface of power</span>, simultaneously shaping cognition, affect, and memory, becoming a core vehicle of discursive power in contemporary society. This article proposes a <span class="highlight">meta-critique of comments</span>: far from being neutral feedback mechanisms, comments constitute a <span class="highlight">tripartite complex—a medium of cognitive colonization, an affective infrastructure, and a battleground for memory competition</span>. Drawing on theories of cross-cultural communication, platform capitalism, and digital memory, we reveal how comments, beneath the seemingly neutral surface of “opinion expression,” quietly reconstruct social cognition, regulate public emotion, and define collective history.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>I. Cognitive Colonization: The Reshaping of Cognition through Discursive Power</h2>
            <p>The first dimension of comment power lies in its <span class="highlight">colonization of cognitive frameworks</span>. Foucault’s dictum that “discourse is power” finds renewed resonance in the digital age: comments construct “legitimate interpretation” through selective framing, contextual omission, and value attribution, leading marginalized cultures to internalize dominant narratives unconsciously. When Western media reduce the South Korean film *Parasite* to a mere “class allegory,” they strip it of its complex roots in Korea’s neoliberal urbanization, Confucian family ethics, and spatial politics. This “decontextualization” exemplifies the cognitive science concept of the <em>framing effect</em>—the way information is presented fundamentally shapes how it is perceived.</p>

            <p>Platform algorithms further amplify this mechanism. On TikTok and YouTube, non-English creators often strategically conform to stereotypical Western commentary frames such as “exoticism” or “narratives of suffering” to gain visibility—a practice of “strategic self-presentation.” For instance, Chinese rural vlogs are frequently tagged with “poverty aesthetics,” prompting creators to reinforce these impressions for algorithmic recommendation, even engaging in self-orientalization. This “cognitive narrowing” reduces African literature in Western book reviews to “postcolonial narratives of suffering,” obscuring its explorations of modernity. Human cognitive plasticity makes individuals susceptible to repeated discourses, ultimately depriving marginalized cultures of the right to self-definition in their own expressions.</p>

            <p>Resistance lies in <em>cognitive decolonization</em>. Jia Zhangke’s persistent use of “everyday realism” resists the “China spectacle” frame imposed by global discourse. Arundhati Roy challenges the linear logic of English literary criticism through nonlinear storytelling. These practices demonstrate that only by reconstructing discursive forms and activating indigenous cognitive paradigms can we reclaim interpretive authority.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>II. Affective Engineering: Social Control under Platform Capitalism</h2>
            <p>The second dimension of comment power is its transformation into a datafied <span class="highlight">affective infrastructure</span>. The convergence of platform capitalism (Srnicek) and affective computing (Picard) turns comments into analyzable and manipulable “emotional data streams.” Platforms prioritize high-arousal comments—those expressing anger, outrage, or identification—through algorithmic recommendation, creating a visibility logic of <em>affective prioritization</em>. Deleuze’s theory of “modulation” reveals that contemporary control societies have shifted from “discipline” to dynamic regulation: platforms modulate users’ psychological states by adjusting the affective weight of comments.</p>

            <p>A paradigmatic case occurred during the 2020 BLM protests, when Twitter and Facebook intervened algorithmically in contentious comments: reducing the visibility of comments labeled “violence” or “riots,” while amplifying those tagged “solidarity” or “justice.” Superficially, this appears as “depolarization,” but in reality, it reflects a form of <em>emotional disinfection and guidance</em>—using affective computing models to channel social protest into a controlled framework of “constructive discussion.” Such interventions serve the platforms’ commercial logic: avoiding political risk, maintaining user retention, and securing ad revenue.</p>

            <p>Deeper still, platforms identify “high-resonance” comments through sentiment analysis, labeling them as “high-quality content” and promoting them (e.g., on Xiaohongshu/RED), creating the illusion of “emotional consensus.” Users internalize the belief that “being recommended equals legitimacy,” causing public discourse to shift from rational deliberation to emotional resonance competition. Platforms become “affective arbitrators,” compressing pluralistic views into “emotional labels,” thereby exercising implicit cognitive discipline. When affect is privatized, the autonomy of democratic deliberation quietly collapses.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>III. Memory Competition: The Struggle for “Quasi-Archival” Status in the Digital Age</h2>
            <p>The third dimension of comment power is its role in the <span class="highlight">struggle for definitional authority over memory</span>. In the digital age, memory is not merely preservation—it is competition. And comments are at the heart of this contest. Halbwachs’ theory of “collective memory” is reconfigured in the digital context: platforms become new “memory frameworks,” and comments become “memory practices.” Platforms assign higher visibility to certain narratives through content moderation, trending rankings, and hashtag curation—exercising what we term “narrative platform power.”</p>

            <p>Consider the case of Dr. Li Wenliang. Comment sections on Weibo, Zhihu, and Douban became sites where public emotion and historical narrative converged. Netizens deconstructed the official “rumor-monger” narrative through comments, using hashtags like “We Remember” to weave individual memories into collective testimony, forming a “counter-archive.” Though lacking the formal status of official archives, these comments—propelled by algorithmic recommendation and social sharing—pushed authorities to revise their characterization, transforming users into both <em>witnesses</em> and <em>agents</em> of memory’s turning point.</p>

            <p>Yet the legitimacy of comments as “quasi-archives” demands scrutiny. Algorithms favor emotional, dramatic content, reducing memory to “taking sides” and “labeling.” Platform governance often suppresses memory competition under the guise of “cleaning up the internet,” such as the mass deletion of comments during pandemic lockdowns, leading to a “sanitized” public memory. Worse, memory is commodified into traffic, eroding its public nature. The “quasi-archival” function of comments depends on sustained user participation, but platform changes and data migration make memory highly vulnerable—our “We Remember” today may be forgotten by algorithms tomorrow.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>IV. The Meta-Critique of Comments: Rebuilding Publicness</h2>
            <p>The integration of these three perspectives reveals that comments constitute a <span class="highlight">tripartite power interface of cognition, affect, and memory</span>. They are simultaneously tools of cognitive colonization for marginalized cultures, affective engineering under platform capitalism, and battlegrounds for digital memory. These dimensions are not isolated: cognitive colonization is often achieved through affective mobilization (e.g., “exoticism” triggering empathy), while emotional resonance lends legitimacy to memory narratives; memory competition, in turn, relies on algorithms that modulate affect and cognition in tandem.</p>

            <p>Hence, we must advance a <span class="highlight">meta-critique of comments</span>: moving beyond critiques of comment *content* to critiques of their <span class="highlight">power structures</span>. The myth of comment neutrality must be dismantled—so-called “objective evaluation” is merely the naturalization of a specific cultural cognitive paradigm; “user experience” is rhetoric for platform business logic; “community safety” is a pretext for memory discipline.</p>

            <p>To rebuild the publicness of comments, we must act on three fronts:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Decolonization</strong>: Promote decentralized interpretation, respect the “incommensurability” of cultural texts, and support autonomous discursive construction by marginalized communities. Establish “context-sensitive” standards for cross-cultural commentary, fostering multilingual, multi-perspective parallel ecosystems.</li>
                <li><strong>Affective Democratization</strong>: Establish transparent audit mechanisms for affective algorithms, and build public affective infrastructures to prevent the privatization and manipulation of emotion. Adopt “algorithmic impact assessment” frameworks, requiring platforms to disclose emotional weighting models and establishing independent oversight bodies.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Publicization</strong>: Ensure long-term accessibility of comments, promote democratic participation in content governance, and prevent “digital forgetting” as a tool of power. We propose creating a “Public Digital Memory Archive”—a searchable, verifiable, open repository of comments from major social events, granting them quasi-public archival status.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Moreover, we must develop <em>comment literacy</em> education to cultivate public sensitivity to the power structures behind comments, transforming users into <span class="highlight">critical commentators</span> rather than passive recipients. Universities, media, and civil society organizations could jointly launch a “Publicness of Comments” movement, advocating for “slow comments,” “deep comments,” and “polyphonic comments” as resistance to algorithm-driven emotional fragmentation.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion: Returning Comments to the Incubator of Public Reason</h2>
            <p>Comments should not be subservient to power, but bearers of democracy. Amid the pressures of cognitive colonization, affective engineering, and memory competition, only through vigilant critique of comment power can we transform comments into genuine <span class="highlight">incubators of public reason</span>—not tools for reproducing power structures.</p>

            <p>When we write “We Remember” in a comment section, we are not merely expressing—we are <span class="highlight">defining</span>: defining what is real, what is just, what is worth remembering. The ultimate value of comments lies not in likes or shares, but in their ability to preserve, amid algorithmic noise, <em>cognitive plurality, emotional authenticity, and the publicness of memory</em>.</p>

            <blockquote>
                Only then can comments truly become the <span class="highlight">nervous endings of democracy</span> in the digital age—not invisible cages of power.
            </blockquote>
