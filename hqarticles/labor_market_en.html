            <h2>The Future of Technology, Career Reshaping, and the Global Labor Market</h2>

            <h3>Current State: Reshaping Technology and Work Environments</h3>
            <p><strong>Rapid technological development</strong> is changing every aspect of work and life at an astonishing pace. Automation, AI, and machine learning are not only replacing many traditional jobs like manufacturing workers and cashiers but also giving birth to numerous emerging professions. Roles like data scientists, AI engineers, and cybersecurity experts are increasingly important, requiring employees to have deep technical knowledge as well as the ability to continuously learn and adapt to new technologies.</p>
            <p><strong>Shifts in generational work values</strong> also significantly impact career choices and corporate management. Millennials and Generation Z prioritize work-life balance, personal growth, and value-driven work, while Baby Boomers and Generation X value job stability and traditional career progression paths. This necessitates different motivational and communication strategies for managing employees from different generations.</p>
            <p>The <strong>balance between globalization and local labor markets</strong> is another key aspect. Globalization offers a wide selection of talent and markets but also requires companies to adapt to different cultures, laws, and market demands. Multinational corporations need not only global resource allocation but must also ensure the innovation capabilities and efficiency of local teams.</p>
