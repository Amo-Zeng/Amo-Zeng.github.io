            <h2>Introduction: Paradigm-Shifting Research on Non-Essential Nutrients</h2>
            <p>In traditional nutrition science, 'non-essential nutrients' are typically defined as components that the body can synthesize on its own or does not require through external intake. However, with deepening research into the gut microbiome, the boundaries of these components' roles are being redefined.</p>
            <p>Growing evidence suggests that certain non-essential nutrients, such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and phytochemicals, not only directly impact host health through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but also significantly alter gut microbiota composition, further modulating metabolic pathways through the 'microbiota-host interaction axis.'</p>

            <h3>Challenging Traditional Assumptions: Non-Essential â‰  Risk-Free</h3>
            <p>It was once thought that higher intake of non-essential nutrients led to greater health benefits with lower risk, suggesting a linear relationship. However, a 2021 study in <em>Cell</em> revealed that excess intake of certain polyphenols under specific metabolic conditions can actually inhibit the proliferation of key probiotic bacteria, generating negative gut signals.</p>
            <p>This discovery prompts a rethinking: Is there a 'lower bound' for the intake of non-essential nutrients? And is this lower bound a fixed value or does it vary dynamically between individuals?</p>

            <h3>'Dynamic Lower Bound': A New Model Concept in Nutritional Science</h3>
            <p>This article proposes the 'dynamic lower bound' model, defining the minimum physiological requirement of non-essential nutrients as a variable function influenced by host genetics, microbiota composition, lifestyle, and metabolic status.</p>
            <p>For example, if individual A has long-term insufficient fiber intake, the abundance of polyphenol-metabolizing bacteria in their gut may decrease, thereby increasing their 'functional demand lower bound' for polyphenols. In individual B, this lower bound may decrease due to a different microbiota structure.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Personalized Pathways for Nutritional Intervention</h3>
            <p>Based on the dynamic lower bound model, future nutritional interventions should consider the following dimensions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Host genotype (e.g., metabolic enzyme polymorphisms)</li>
                <li>Gut microbiota composition profile</li>
                <li>Short-term dietary history and metabolic phenotype (e.g., blood glucose, cholesterol levels)</li>
                <li>Lifestyle factors</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Integrating Science and Technology for Precision Nutrition</h3>
            <p>By applying machine learning and big data analytics to nutritional science, we can better understand individual variability in nutrient metabolism and gut microbiome function. This approach enables the development of tailored dietary recommendations that adapt dynamically as a person's health condition and microbiome profile evolve over time.</p>
