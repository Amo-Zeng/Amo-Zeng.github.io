            <p>In today’s digital art ecosystem, increasingly dominated by platform algorithms, the visibility of art exhibitions is no longer solely determined by curators or cultural institutions—it is silently reshaped by AI curation systems. From Google Arts & Culture’s personalized recommendations to the Venice Biennale’s introduction of an “AI curatorial assistant,” algorithms have become invisible yet powerful “cultural gatekeepers.” Yet beneath the façade of “intelligent neutrality” lies a profound cultural-political tension: algorithms are not merely technical tools, but <strong class="highlight">new carriers of epistemic power</strong>, whose operational logic is deeply embedded within the structural history of global cultural inequality.</p>

            <h2>Algorithms as Sociotechnical Assemblages: Epistemic Bias from an STS Perspective</h2>
            <p>From the perspective of Science and Technology Studies (STS), algorithms are not value-neutral; they are products of “sociotechnical assemblages.” Their training data heavily relies on digitized archives from Western art institutions—such as MoMA and Tate Modern—whose collections themselves are legacies of colonial knowledge systems. Postcolonial theorist Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak once critiqued “epistemic violence”—the systematic erasure of marginalized discourses by dominant knowledge regimes. In the algorithmic context, this violence becomes technologized: contemporary African art is often labeled “tribal” or “primitive,” while Chinese ink painting is frequently categorized as “traditional” rather than “contemporary.” Such classifications are not accidental, but rather <strong>reproductions of cultural coding</strong> embedded in training data, perpetuating the marginalization of non-Western art within AI’s semantic networks.</p>

            <blockquote>
                “Algorithms are not merely technical tools, but new carriers of epistemic power, whose operational logic is deeply embedded within the structural history of global cultural inequality.”
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Algorithmic Gaze: Decontextualization and the Erosion of Artistic Resistance</h2>
            <p>More critically, algorithms’ “decontextualizing” mechanisms erode the potential for resistance in art. For instance, Brazilian artist Ernesto Neto’s work critiques globalization and ecological crisis, yet within Instagram’s AI recommendation system, its organic forms are reduced to “immersive experiences” or “natural aesthetics,” stripping away its political meaning and transforming it into consumable sensory data. This “algorithmic gaze” simplifies complex artistic practices into visual tags, turning art from the Global South into decorative “cultural otherness” within the logic of platform-driven engagement.</p>

            <h2>Counter-Data Practices: Algorithmic Resistance from Local Communities</h2>
            <p>Yet resistance is emerging. Technologists and artists are reclaiming algorithmic power through <strong>counter-data practices</strong>. For example, the South African project “Digital Africa” trains bespoke AI models using indigenous language corpora and community oral histories, rejecting reliance on English-dominated pre-trained datasets. They advocate for <strong>data sovereignty</strong>—the principle that the collection, annotation, and use of artistic data must be led by local communities.</p>

            <p>Similarly, the Indian artist collective behind the Kochi-Muziris Biennale launched the “Algorithmic Decolonization” project, deliberately injecting “incorrect labels” into recommendation systems to expose AI’s misreadings of South Asian art, forming a <strong>strategic misrecognition</strong> as a critical technique.</p>

            <h3>Open Source and Audibility: Reimagining Algorithmic Transparency</h3>
            <p>Moreover, open-source movements are advancing <strong>auditable algorithmic curation</strong>. Platforms like “Art-AI Watch” require art-tech collaborators to disclose data provenance, annotation bias metrics, and introduce “cultural diversity weights” to actively balance geographic, linguistic, and medium-based disparities in recommendations. This is not merely technical correction, but a challenge to the “cultural hegemony of platform capitalism.”</p>

            <h2>From Tool to Interface: Toward Negotiative Algorithmic Curation</h2>
            <p>The crisis of algorithmic curation is, at its core, the <strong>technological translation</strong> of colonial knowledge systems in the digital age. If we only pursue “fairer” algorithms without interrogating who owns data and who defines value, multiculturalism will ultimately become mere ornamentation for technocratic governance. The real path forward lies in transforming algorithms from “neutral tools” into <strong>negotiative interfaces</strong>, where non-Western artistic experiences are not only “seen,” but truly <strong>understood</strong>—requiring deep alliances between the art world, technology communities, and postcolonial knowledge production.</p>

            <p>Only then can AI become a collaborator in decolonizing artistic ecosystems, rather than a new agent of cultural hegemony.</p>
