            <h2>An Integrated Analysis of Trump's Social Media Strategy, Global Political Influence, and Political Branding Effect</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>In the contemporary political arena, Donald Trump has profoundly altered the way political communication, global relations, and political branding are constructed through his unique political strategies and innovative use of social media. This article aims to explore how these elements interact by integrating Trump's Twitter strategy (now X platform), its impact on international relations, and the effect of political branding, shaping his political career and having a profound influence on the global political landscape.</p>

            <h3>Trump's X Platform Strategy and the Transformation of Political Discourse</h3>
            <p>Trump communicates directly with voters via the X platform, employing the following strategies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Direct Communication and Immediacy:</strong> Trump bypasses traditional media filters to deliver messages directly to the public. This not only reduces distortion in information dissemination but also leverages the immediacy of the X platform, allowing him to respond quickly to events and seize the high ground of public opinion.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Expression:</strong> Trump's posts are often filled with emotion, using straightforward language. This approach contrasts sharply with the caution and rationality of traditional politics, resonating with grassroots voters' emotions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These strategies not only shape Trump's image as a populist leader but also, by utilizing social media algorithms, ensure widespread dissemination of his messages, thereby influencing the distribution of political discourse and weakening the roles of traditional media and political intermediaries.</p>

            <h3>Trump's Global Political Influence</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"America First" Policy:</strong> Trump's policies emphasize American national interests, leading to the U.S. withdrawal from several international agreements, like the Paris Climate Agreement and the Iran nuclear deal. This not only reshapes America's role on the international stage but also prompts a reevaluation of the global governance system.</li>
                <li><strong>Redefining Relationships with Allies:</strong> Questioning NATO, engaging in trade wars with allies, etc., challenges traditional international relationship models, prompting allied nations to reconsider their positioning in global politics.</li>
                <li><strong>Policy Towards China:</strong> Trump's trade war with China and technology blockades have intensified competition between the U.S. and China, pushing for a restructuring of global technology supply chains and encouraging China to seek alternative cooperation internationally.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These strategies might bring some economic and political benefits to the U.S. in the short term, but they undermine America's global leadership status in the long run, increasing international relations' uncertainty.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Trump's Political Branding Effect</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Style and Business Background:</strong> Trump's candidness and image as a successful businessman have won him broad support, especially among voters disillusioned with the traditional political system.</li>
                <li><strong>Media Utilization:</strong> Through social media, Trump interacts directly with voters, constructing and promoting his political brand, which has not only had an impact within the U.S. but also garnered global attention.</li>
                <li><strong>Influence and Legacy:</strong> Trump's political brand has had a profound impact both within and outside the Republican Party, prompting other politicians to adopt similar strategies in campaigns and policy-making. Even after leaving office, his political legacy continues to influence the future direction of the Republican Party and strategic adjustments by global political leaders.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Trump has successfully reshaped the rules of political engagement and international relations through his social media strategies, global political actions, and unique political branding effect. The combination of these strategies not only changes the mode of political communication but also leaves a lasting impact on the global political landscape. Future politicians will need to balance this direct communication model, traditional forms of political engagement, and international cooperation to navigate the political ecosystem post-Trump. However, this new political dynamic also poses challenges regarding information accuracy, political polarization, and the quality of public discourse. The future political environment will need to find a new balance between maintaining the openness of democratic participation and ensuring the quality of political discourse.</p>

            <h3>Improvement Suggestions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increase Data Support:</strong> Introduce specific data to support the impact of Trump's social media strategies on voter behavior. For example, citing poll data, X platform analysis reports, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>In-depth Analysis:</strong> Provide a more detailed analysis of Trump's strategies, such as analyzing specific tweets or policy decisions and their direct impact on international relations.</li>
                <li><strong>Cite Authoritative Opinions:</strong> Include comments from scholars, experts, or other political leaders to enhance the persuasiveness of the arguments.</li>
                <li><strong>Case Studies:</strong> Add specific case studies, like an event or policy shift triggered by one of Trump's tweets, to illustrate the real-world effects of his strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Language Refinement:</strong> Some parts of the article could be more concise to avoid repetitive content. For example, the sentence "These strategies might bring some economic and political benefits to the U.S. in the short term, but they undermine America's global leadership status in the long run" could be expressed more succinctly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through these improvements, the article can become more rigorous, comprehensive, and enhance its academic and analytical value.</p>
