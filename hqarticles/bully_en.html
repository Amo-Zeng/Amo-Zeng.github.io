            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In today's highly digitalized era, the virtual world not only provides new ways for social interaction but also serves as a breeding ground for bullying. Additionally, bullying as a cross-cultural phenomenon varies in form, motivation, and impact due to cultural backgrounds. Furthermore, neuroscience research sheds light on the biological underpinnings of bullying behavior. This article aims to integrate digital identity, cross-cultural perspectives, and neuroscience research to deeply explore the multidimensional issues of bullying and propose comprehensive solutions.</p>

            <h3>II. Cross-Cultural Perspectives on Bullying</h3>
            <h4>1. Cultural Differences:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Western Culture</strong> emphasizes the repetitive nature of bullying and power imbalance, focusing on individual rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Asian Culture</strong> values social exclusion and collective pressure, often linked to "face" and group honor.</li>
                <li><strong>Middle Eastern Culture</strong> might involve honor and family reputation, with a strong sense of ethnic identity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Forms of Expression and Coping Strategies:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical, verbal, cyber, and social bullying</strong> vary by cultural context in form and severity.</li>
                <li><strong>Coping Strategies</strong> include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Education and Prevention</strong>: Promote anti-bullying education in schools and communities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal and Policy</strong>: Develop cross-culturally applicable laws and policies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cultural Adaptation</strong>: Increase understanding and respect for different cultures.</li>
                        <li><strong>Community Engagement</strong>: Encourage community members to actively participate in anti-bullying initiatives.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Cross-Cultural Prevention and Intervention:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global Standards</strong>: Establish uniform anti-bullying standards, but adapt them locally for different cultures.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Education</strong>: Introduce cross-cultural understanding courses in educational systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology Support</strong>: Develop cross-cultural bullying reporting and support systems for users from different backgrounds.</li>

        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>III. Neuroscience and Bullying Behavior</h3>
            <h4>1. Neurobiological Foundations:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bullies</strong> have low activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), affecting emotional regulation and impulse control.</li>
                <li>Overactive reward systems provide short-term pleasure from bullying behavior.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Brain Responses of Victims:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Victims might show symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), with increased amygdala activity.</li>
                <li>Social cognition and empathy might be impacted, leading to heightened alertness to similar situations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Decision-Making and Moral Judgment:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Bullies' moral judgment might be impaired, with reduced activity in the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex affecting moral decisions.</li>
                <li>Group dynamics significantly influence bullying, involving reward systems and responses to social pain.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>4. Interventions and Treatments:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</strong>: Help bullies and victims manage their behavior and emotions.</li>
                <li><strong>Neurofeedback Training</strong>: Adjust brain activity through real-time feedback to enhance self-control.</li>
                <li><strong>Empathy Training</strong>: Enhance understanding and empathy in bullies and victims by simulating others' experiences.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Bullying behavior presents a complex picture at the intersection of digitalization, globalization, and neuroscience. Understanding the role of digital identity in virtual worlds, the expressions of bullying across different cultural backgrounds, and the neural mechanisms of bullying is essential to address this issue. By integrating technology, education, legal frameworks, and psychological support, we can protect individual digital identities, promote cultural understanding, and reduce bullying. Future research and policy-making should continue to explore these intersections to build a safer, more inclusive, and understanding global social environment.</p>
