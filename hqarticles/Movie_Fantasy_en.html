            <p>In the contemporary context of globalized capitalism, everything—from labor time to emotional relationships—is subsumed under the logic of exchange-value, alienated into consumable commodities. However, fantasy narratives, by constructing a magical item circulation system based on the "gift economy," offer us an alternative imagination of social relations. These magical items—such as the One Ring, wands, the food in the bathhouse, or Nichirin Blades—are not ordinary commodities but mediums of social relations imbued with honor, responsibility, curses, and fate. They follow the logic of the "spirit of the gift" (hau) described by anthropologist Marcel Mauss: circulation is not based on equivalent exchange but on destiny, trials, giving, and inheritance; their value lies in their inalienable "aura" and social bonding properties. By analyzing <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, <em>Harry Potter</em>, and Hayao Miyazaki's <em>Spirited Away</em>, we can uncover how the gift economy challenges the commodity fetishism of modern capitalism and provides cultural resources for reconstructing social relations.</p>

            <h3>I. The Logic of Magical Item Circulation: The Gift Economy's Subversion of the Commodity Economy</h3>
            <p>In the fantasy world, the circulation of magical items fundamentally diverges from the calculative logic of the commodity economy. They are not cold objects of transaction but existences with subjectivity and social life.</p>
            
            <h4>The One Ring in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em></h4>
            <p>The trajectory of the One Ring perfectly illustrates the complexity of the gift economy. It circulates not through market exchange but through a ritualistic network of fate, betrayal, and gifting: from the dual attributes of power and curse bestowed by Sauron at its forging, to Isildur "winning" it in battle yet unable to truly "own" it, to Bilbo "gaining" it through a riddle game rather than purchasing it, and finally to Frodo inheriting the mission to destroy it. Each transfer reconstructs the social relations of Middle-earth—networks of alliance, betrayal, and responsibility. The Ring cannot be priced because its value lies not in its utility but in the historical weight and relational bonds it carries.</p>
            
            <h4>Wands and the Deathly Hallows in <em>Harry Potter</em></h4>
            <p>The acquisition of wands follows the principle of "the wand chooses the wizard," a non-economic logic based on recognition and fate. Ollivanders wand shop appears to be a store but is essentially a ritualistic space: the price of wands is deliberately downplayed, and the selection process resembles a fateful pairing. More extreme are the Deathly Hallows: the Elder Wand changes ownership through dueling victory rather than purchase, while the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak are passed down through bloodline inheritance. The circulation of these items establishes a system of reciprocity based on ability, lineage, and destiny, utterly rejecting the calculability and alienability of the commodity economy.</p>
            
            <h4>Food and Names in the Bathhouse of <em>Spirited Away</em></h4>
            <p>The bathhouse superficially operates as a commercial establishment but secretly runs on the rules of a gift economy. Chihiro obtains food through labor, but the苦丸子 (bitter pill) given by the River God and the woven charm from Zeniba are not commodities—they are transferred through a logic of help and reciprocation. Particularly important is the "name": Chihiro's true name is returned to her by Haku; this is not a transaction but a gift of emotion and trust. The loss and recovery of her name映射 (maps onto) the alienation and recovery of the relationship between the individual and the world, critiquing the capitalist logic that commodifies everything, including identity.</p>

            <h3>II. The Inalienable "Aura": Objects as Bearers of Social Relations</h3>
            <p>The core value of these magical items lies in their "inalienability"—they凝结 (condense) social relations, honor, curses, or fate and cannot be reduced to exchange-value.</p>
            
            <h4>The One Ring: The Duality of Power and Curse</h4>
            <p>The Ring is not merely a tool of power but also a touchstone of morality. It corrupts its bearers, forcing each individual to confront the tension between personal desire and social responsibility. This "curse" is essentially a social constraint mechanism, ensuring that its circulation is always accompanied by ethical trials—such as Boromir's death and Frodo's sacrifice. The value of the Ring lies precisely in this heavy relational load, not in its "use-value" for ruling the world.</p>
            
            <h4>Wands: Symbols of Loyalty and Identity</h4>
            <p>The connection between a wand and a wizard transcends instrumentality. Harry's holly wand and Voldemort's yew wand share a core from the same phoenix feather; this "twinness" makes them material incarnations of a fated opposition. The loyalty of wands (such as the Elder Wand allegiance to the one who defeats its previous master) establishes a system of honor based on recognition and ability, not property logic.</p>
            
            <h4>Food and Names in the Bathhouse: The Recovery of Memory and Identity</h4>
            <p>In the bathhouse, eating too much food turns one into a pig—a direct satire of consumerist alienation. Conversely, the River God's苦丸子 (bitter pill) and Zeniba's charm carry memory and care: they heal not physical hunger but existential alienation. Chihiro's true name is a symbol of essential identity; its recovery意味着 (signifies) reclaiming the inalienable self in a commodified world.</p>

            <h3>III. Disenchanting Capitalist Fetishism: The Critical Power of the Gift Economy</h3>
            <p>Through the gift economy, fantasy narratives achieve a disenchantment of capitalist commodity fetishism. They expose the absurdity of the commodity fetish, which abstracts social relations into exchange-value.</p>
            
            <p>Capitalism transforms everything into quantifiable, replaceable commodities, obscuring the concrete labor and social relations behind things. Magical items in fantasy works do precisely the opposite: their value lies in their irreplaceable storied, relational, and moral qualities. The value of the Ring lies not in its metallic weight but in the millennia of history and ethical choices it carries; the power of a wand lies not in the wood's material but in its resonance with the wizard's destiny; the meaning of the food in the bathhouse lies not in its satiating function but in the emotional intent of the giver.</p>
            
            <p>This contrast points directly to the alienation in the real world: when friendship is quantified as social media likes, love is simplified into matching algorithms in the marriage market, and education is alienated into the purchase of diploma commodities, are we also living under a certain "bathhouse contract"? Fantasy narratives remind us: truly meaningful social relations cannot be commodified; they must be sustained through the gift economy of giving, responsibility, and reciprocity.</p>

            <h3>IV. Reimagining Social Relations: From Cold Contracts to Warm Reciprocity</h3>
            <p>The gift economy not only critiques reality but also offers an imagination of alternative social relations. It showcases a warm connection based on giving, obligation, and reciprocity, contrasting with the cold, calculative contract relations of capitalism.</p>
            
            <h4>The Alliance Formed by the Ring's Quest in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em></h4>
            <p>The mission to destroy the Ring leads elves, humans, dwarves, and hobbits to transcend calculated self-interest and form an alliance based on shared responsibility. This bond is a pledge, not a contract; a sharing of fate, not an exchange of interests.</p>
            
            <h4>The Network of Trust Built by Magical Items in <em>Harry Potter</em></h4>
            <p>The inheritance of the Deathly Hallows, the allegiance of wands, and the sharing of the Marauder's Map and the Invisibility Cloak establish a mutual aid system based on loyalty and capability. The operation of the Order of the Phoenix relies not on monetary compensation but on belief and gifts.</p>
            
            <h4>Reciprocal Labor in the Bathhouse of <em>Spirited Away</em></h4>
            <p>Chihiro gains the right to survive through labor, but what ultimately saves her are emotional gifts—Haku returning her name, No-Face giving medicine, Zeniba weaving a charm. The bathhouse's "operating rules" are ultimately penetrated by the gift economy: real change comes from non-calculative mutual aid.</p>
            
            <p>These imaginings provide us with cultural resources超越 (beyond) market logic: social relations can be built on recognition, responsibility, and reciprocity, not solely maintained by contracts and currency.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Towards the Ethical Implications of the Gift Economy</h3>
            <p>The gift economy in fantasy narratives is not only a disenchantment of capitalist fetishism but also an ethical call: in an era where everything is priced, how do we safeguard those inalienable values—honor, responsibility, genuine relationships, and shared fate? The circulation of magical items启示 (reveals) to us: true "ownership" is not possession in the sense of property rights but acknowledgment of the relational network and ethical responsibilities behind the object.</p>
            
            <p>Perhaps we need a contemporary "disenchantment": to break the myth of commodity fetishism and重新看见 (re-see) the stories, emotions, and human connections behind things. Just as Chihiro remembers her true name, Frodo undertakes his mission, and Harry accepts the fate of the twin wands, can we, amidst the torrent of consumerism, reclaim those "gifts" that cannot be priced yet constitute the meaning of life?</p>
            
            <p>This is not merely a fantasy allegory but a profound hope for the reconstruction of real social relations.</p>
