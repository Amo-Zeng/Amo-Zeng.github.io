            <h2>The Concreteness, Framing Effects, and Silence of Language: Tensions with Thought</h2>
            <p>Language, as the core tool of human communication, serves both as a carrier and a framework for thought. However, language is not the sole means of expressing thought, and the relationship between language and thought is complex and tension-filled. Language describes reality through concrete vocabulary, yet abstract thought can transcend these limits. Language shapes habitual thinking through framing effects, but the leaps of thought often reside in the silence of language. This article explores how the concreteness, framing effects, and silence of language interact with the abstraction, inertia, and leaps of thought, revealing the deeper meaning of these tensions in innovation and creativity.</p>

            <h3>1. The Concreteness of Language and the Abstraction of Thought: A Dialogue of Two Forms of Cognition</h3>
            <p>The concreteness of language is manifested in its use of specific vocabulary and expressions to describe the real world. For example, the Inuit language's detailed distinctions between various forms of snow reflect the deep observation of the environment by its speakers. However, this concreteness may also limit the abstract capabilities of thought, confining it to specific categories and making it difficult to reason and innovate at broader abstract levels.</p>
            <p>Yet, the abstraction of thought is central to human cognition. Concepts like "infinity" and "sets" in mathematics, and theories like "energy" and "force fields" in science, are products of abstract thought. These concepts cannot be fully expressed through concrete language, yet they are the core of scientific innovation and theoretical construction. The tension between the concreteness of language and the abstraction of thought is a reflection of the complexity of human cognition.</p>

            <h3>2. The Framing Effects of Language and the Inertia of Thought: From Solidification to Emancipation</h3>
            <p>Language is not just a tool for transmitting information; it also shapes the "frame" of thought through the combination of grammar, vocabulary, and context. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's "framing effect" suggests that the same objective information, when presented differently, can lead to different decisions. For instance, "90% success rate" and "10% failure rate" convey the same information, but people's psychological reactions to these two expressions are vastly different.</p>
            <p>The framing effects of language not only influence short-term decisions but also gradually solidify thinking patterns through long-term use, forming the inertia of thought. This inertia makes people tend to rely on existing frameworks when facing new problems, overlooking other possible solutions. Through linguistic innovation, we can break the inertia of thought. The emergence of new technologies often accompanies new terminology and concepts, which redefine thinking frameworks and drive innovation and change.</p>

            <h3>3. The Silence of Language and the Leaps of Thought: Creative Non-linear Thinking</h3>
            <p>The silence of language is not a flaw in thought but a medium for leaps of thought. Language is linear, unfolding in time or space, but thought is often non-linear, relying on associations, metaphors, and instantaneous intuition. Many creative thoughts occur in the "silence" of language, in those parts that cannot be clearly expressed through language.</p>
            <p>Psychologist Jean Piaget noted that thought is a dynamic process of construction that does not entirely depend on language. In fact, many thought activities occur beyond the boundaries of language, relying on a "silent language" that involves emotions, images, sounds, and other non-linear forms of information flow. This "silent language" is not only a medium for creative thought but also a trigger for leaps of thought.</p>

            <h3>4. The Tensions Between Language and Thought: The Source of Innovation and Creativity</h3>
            <p>The concreteness, framing effects, and silence of language, and the abstraction, inertia, and leaps of thought, exist in deep tension. This tension is not only a core characteristic of human cognition but also the source of innovation and creativity. By understanding this tension, we may find opportunities for leaps of thought in the silence of language and explore broader cognitive spaces in innovation and creativity.</p>
