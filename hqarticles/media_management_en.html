            <h2>Introduction: Media Management in the Digital Age—Complexity and New Challenges for Sustainable Development</h2>
            <p>In today's rapidly advancing digital technology landscape, media management is no longer confined to traditional content dissemination and technological innovation. Instead, it is deeply embedded in the construction of digital identities, the challenges of data ethics, and the practices of sustainable development. Media platforms serve not only as vehicles for information transmission but also as shapers of social culture, economic activities, and individual identities. However, with the rapid development of technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and the metaverse, media management is facing unprecedented complexity and multidimensional challenges.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Part One: Digital Identity—The Reconstruction of Self and Society in Media Management</h3>
            <p><strong>Self-Reconstruction in the Digital Age: The Silent Revolution of Media Management</strong></p>
            <p>In the digital era, individual self-perception and social interaction methods are undergoing a silent revolution. Media management in this process is not just a technological intermediary but also an active participant in the construction of individual identities. Users' digital identities are no longer merely a collection of personal information in the traditional sense but are dynamically generated through their behavior, interests, and social relationships in virtual spaces such as social media and the metaverse.</p>
            <p><strong>Algorithm-Driven Identity Shaping: The Role of Media Management as a "Sculptor"</strong></p>
            <p>Social media platforms like Douyin (TikTok) and Weibo act as "sculptors" of users' digital identities through complex algorithmic mechanisms. Douyin's recommendation algorithm analyzes users' browsing history, liking behavior, and interaction patterns to precisely push content, further strengthening users' interest tags and creating what is known as an "information cocoon." Weibo, on the other hand, guides users to focus on specific issues through interest tags, social relationship chains, and participation in hot events, thereby reinforcing their social identity.</p>
            <p><strong>Metaverse and Virtual Idols: The Reshaping of Digital Identity by Emerging Technologies</strong></p>
            <p>The rise of emerging technologies such as the metaverse and virtual idols offers new possibilities for the construction of digital identities. In the metaverse, users can engage in social interactions, creativity, and interaction through digital avatars. The role of media managers shifts from traditional information disseminators to identity experience designers. By creating more immersive and interactive virtual spaces, media managers can help users explore and express richer selves in the metaverse.</p>

            <h3>Part Two: Data Ethics—Moral Dilemmas and Technical Solutions in Media Management</h3>
            <p><strong>Ethical Dilemmas in the Era of Big Data: Transparency and Accountability Challenges in Media Management</strong></p>
            <p>With the widespread adoption of big data technology, media management is facing unprecedented ethical dilemmas. Transparency, fairness, and accountability in the collection, use, and sharing of data are core issues that media managers must address. Incidents such as Facebook's "Cambridge Analytica" scandal and Google's ad targeting discrimination cases not only reveal privacy infringement issues in data collection and algorithmic decision-making but also highlight the risks of algorithmic discrimination and exacerbation of social inequality.</p>
            <p><strong>Privacy Protection and Algorithm Fairness: Double Challenges for Media Management</strong></p>
            <p>How to strike a balance between user privacy protection and commercial interests? How to achieve coordinated development between algorithmic transparency and fairness? These questions are not only technical challenges for media management but also ethical and social responsibility tests.</p>

            <h3>Part Three: Green Transition—Pathways to Sustainable Development in Media Management</h3>
            <p><strong>Environmental Impact of the Media Industry: The Urgency of Green Media Management</strong></p>
            <p>The media industry significantly impacts the environment through content production, platform operations, and product development. The resource consumption of traditional print media, the energy consumption of digital media, and electronic waste issues are areas that media managers need to focus on.</p>
            <p><strong>Practical Pathways for Green Media Management</strong></p>
            <p>Media managers can explore pathways for green media management through resource conservation, energy efficiency improvements, and waste disposal. For example, promoting the digital transformation of print media, using renewable energy to power data centers, and promoting electronic product recycling programs are effective measures to reduce environmental impact.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Future Outlook of Media Management—A Multidimensional Balance Between Technology and Ethics</h3>
            <p>In the face of the multidimensional challenges of the digital age, media managers not only need to keep pace with rapid technological iterations but also seek balance between ethics, social responsibility, and sustainable development. In the future, media managers will need to find a multidimensional balance between technology and humanity, rationality and sensibility. By achieving algorithmic transparency, data privacy protection, and green media management, they can promote the healthy development of the media ecosystem.</p>
