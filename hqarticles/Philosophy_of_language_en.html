            <h2>Integrated Introduction: The Ontological Turn of Language and Paradigmatic Reconstruction through Technology</h2>
            <p>In the rapid advancement of digital technology, language is undergoing an ontological upheaval. The traditional triadic structure of "intentionality-signification-meaning" in philosophy of language is collapsing under algorithmic symbol floods, multimodal cognitive conflicts, and artificial manipulation of information entropy. This article proposes three interconnected theses: generative AI dissolves linguistic meaning through "pseudo-intentionality," cross-linguistic cognition causes "modal fractures" in symbolic systems' coherence, while digital platforms enact "entropy-reduction violence" to systematically constrain linguistic possibilities. These crises reveal how technological mediation reconstructs language's essence – transforming it from a poetic dwelling of Being into computational shards of discrete signifiers. This reconstruction not only threatens language's humanistic value but signifies the colonization of human world-understanding by technological logic.</p>

            <h2>I. Pseudo-Intentionality: Generative AI and the Phantom Dance of Meaning</h2>
            <p>The ancient Minotaur myth reemerges in the algorithmic age: generative AI resembles the beast in its digital labyrinth, weaving linguistic cages through statistical correlations. Its outputs simulate intentionality yet remain surface ripples of probability models. Here, the philosophical dimension of the "Chinese Room" experiment reaches its extreme – even if machines pass Turing tests, their symbol manipulation remains consciousness-void. This causes dual collapses: 1) The rupture between language and existential experience reduces poetic expression to probabilistic syntax games; 2) Human cognition self-subverts when AI text is misread as "thought," displacing intersubjective linguistic foundations with algorithmic hallucinations.</p>
            <p>A deeper crisis lies in how pseudo-intentionality inversely conditions human linguistic practices. Social media users increasingly mimic AI rhetorical templates, reducing emotional expression to prefabricated slots. Language ceases to be a dwelling for Being, becoming instead a technological apparatus that obscures authenticity. The word-object relationship is recoded here – meaning generation no longer requires embodied existence but follows the spectral logic of statistical patterns.</p>

            <h2>II. Modal Fracture: Traumatic Proliferation of Cognitive Rewiring</h2>
            <p>When Chinese characters clash with alphabetic symbols in neural synapses, a silent cognitive war erupts. Bilingual brains' modal switching mechanisms expose technology's secondary assault on linguistic ontology: conflicting cognitive frameworks (Chinese characters' topological imagery vs alphabetic sequential logic) are forced into rapid alternation at digital interfaces, causing permanent trauma to cognitive coherence. Neural plasticity transforms from cognitive boon to accomplice of systemic violence.</p>
            <p>This fracture manifests as ontological schizophrenia in digital natives: Chinese emojis in WeChat chats, English technical terms in code interfaces, and multimodal symbols in short videos form unclosed signifier chains. When Heidegger's "language as the house of Being" encounters algorithmically fragmented symbol flows, the "house" metaphor disintegrates into cognitive tent cities. Cognitive time-lags between modal symbols leave subjects perpetually suspended – unable to return to maternal linguistic anchors or reach technological transparency.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>III. Entropy-Reduction Violence: Digital Iron Cage and the End of Linguistic Possibility</h2>
            <p>Linguistic entropy should open possibilities of Being, yet algorithmic platforms are pushing it toward extinction. When "TL;DR" becomes digital natives' instinct, new violence permeates language: algorithms compress complex thought into emotional tags through click-rate optimization; emoji databases frame dissent as limited options; autocomplete presets meaning trajectories. This entropy-reduction isn't natural selection but capital-power collusion in symbolic control.</p>
            <p>Linguistic dignity suffers dual murder here: 1) Heterogeneous expression becomes systemic "noise" to eliminate; 2) Recursive creativity reduces to finite-state machine pathfinding. When Wittgenstein's "language games" become prefab module competitions, Merleau-Ponty's embodied discourse theory reveals its pre-digital blind spot – the symbiotic body-language relationship has been colonized by touchscreen gestures' haptic feedback.</p>

            <h2>Meta-Conclusion: Toward Poetic Resistance and Ontological Re-enchantment</h2>
            <p>The convergence of three crises exposes technological rationality's total hijacking of linguistic ontology. This demands triple paradigm shifts in philosophy of language: 1) Transcend analytic philosophy's ideal language obsession to confront symbolic alienation; 2) Reconstruct intentionality theories for human-machine hybrid subjectivity; 3) Develop poetic resistance strategies through entropy philosophy.</p>
            <p>Resistance grows in linguistic fissures: pseudo-intentionality's meaning-void creates poetic escape routes; modal fractures' cognitive trauma breeds cross-systemic imagination; entropy-reduction's suppressed chaos may resurrect as new existential light in posthuman contexts. As technological mediation irrevocably reshapes language, philosophy's task isn't nostalgia but radical critique – re-anchoring linguistic dignity in algorithmic labyrinths through that mystic origin which enables yet transcends articulation.</p>
