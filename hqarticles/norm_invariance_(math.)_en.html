            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The invariance of norms, as one of the core concepts of modern physics, ensures the form-invariance of physical laws under different reference frames or norms. This principle not only plays a central role in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory but also serves as a fundamental aspect in electrodynamics, particle physics, and other fields. However, can the concept of invariance of norms transcend the boundaries of physics and extend into neuroscience and social sciences? This article delves into the applications of invariance of norms in quantum entanglement, brain neural networks, and social norms, revealing the profound connections among symmetry and nonlocality, robustness and generalization abilities, as well as the stability and transformation of social systems through this interdisciplinary perspective.</p>

            <h3>Deep Integration of Quantum Entanglement and Invariance of Norms</h3>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is one of the most mysterious phenomena in quantum mechanics, describing a special correlation between two or more particles, where the measurement of one particle immediately affects the state of another, regardless of their distance. At the same time, the invariance of norms ensures the form-invariance of physical laws under different norms. This article explores whether the invariance of norms imposes constraints on the essence of quantum entanglement and the possible impacts of such constraints.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Invariance of Norms and Locality:</strong> The invariance of norms is inherently closely related to locality, while the nonlocality of quantum entanglement seems to conflict with the local requirement of the invariance of norms. This contradiction provokes the discussion of whether the invariance of norms imposes constraints on quantum entanglement.</li>
                <li><strong>Invariance of Norms and Symmetry Breaking:</strong> The invariance of norms requires physical laws to remain unchanged under norm transformations, but in some cases, the ground state (vacuum state) of the system may not be norm-invariant. Could this spontaneous symmetry breaking affect the manifestation of quantum entanglement?</li>
                <li><strong>Invariance of Norms and Entanglement Measures:</strong> The impact of the invariance of norms on entanglement measures (such as entanglement entropy) is also a topic worth exploring. Do norm transformations impose constraints on the form of entanglement entropy?</li>

            <h3>Exploring "Invariance of Norms" in Neural Networks</h3>
            <p>In the field of neuroscience, neural networks are complex systems composed of a large number of interconnected neurons. Each neuron receives input signals from other neurons, processes them, and outputs signals. The learning and computational processes of neural networks involve the adjustment and optimization of neuron connection weights. This article explores whether neural computation follows some form of "invariance of norms" and explains the robustness and generalization abilities of neural networks, as well as the pathogenesis of neurological diseases through this perspective.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Norm Transformations" in Neural Networks:</strong> Viewing the connection patterns of neurons as a "norm," the learning and computational processes of neural networks are transformations of this "norm." This perspective helps to understand the learning process of neural networks.</li>
                <li><strong>"Invariance of Norms" and Robustness and Generalization Abilities of Neural Networks:</strong> Can the robustness and generalization abilities of neural networks be analogized to "invariance of norms"? Even with slight changes in the connection patterns of neurons, the neural network can still recognize the same patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Breaking "Norm Symmetry" in Brain Neural Networks:</strong> Certain neurological diseases may be related to abnormal changes in the connection patterns of neurons; can such changes be seen as breaking "norm symmetry"?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Exploring "Invariance of Norms" in Social Norms</h3>
            <p>Can the concept of invariance of norms, derived from physics, be analogized to social sciences by considering social norms as a form of "invariance of norms"? This article explores this question and further analyzes whether social norms can be defined as a form of "norm transformation," and how this analogy explains the stability and continuity of social systems, as well as helps to understand the motivations behind social change and institutional transformation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Norm Transformations" in Social Norms:</strong> Social norms differ under different social and cultural backgrounds, and this difference can be regarded as a "transformation" of social norms. The formation of social norms is often based on specific cultures, histories, and social environments, which can be understood as "norm transformations" under different social conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Stability and Continuity of Social Systems:</strong> The invariance of social norms can partially explain the stability and continuity of social systems. Even in the face of significant changes in social structures and external environments, some basic social norms remain unchanged.</li>
                <li><strong>Breaking "Norm Symmetry" in Social Norms:</strong> Social change and institutional transformation often occur because the existing social norms cannot adapt to new social needs; can such changes be seen as breaking "norm symmetry"?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>As a core concept in physics, the invariance of norms not only plays a fundamental role in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory but can also transcend disciplinary boundaries and extend into the fields of neuroscience and social sciences. By exploring the invariance of norms in quantum entanglement,
