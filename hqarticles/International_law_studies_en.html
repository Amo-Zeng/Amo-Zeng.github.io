            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of digital technology, international law is facing unprecedented challenges and opportunities. This article explores the reshaping and innovation of international law in the digital age from three key perspectives: "International Law + Artificial Intelligence," "International Law + Climate Change + Human Rights," and "International Law + Digital Sovereignty." The era of artificial intelligence has introduced new principles for algorithmic governance, such as transparency, fairness, and accountability, while also challenging international dispute resolution mechanisms and data sovereignty. The threat of climate change to human rights highlights the shortcomings of the existing international legal system, making it urgent to establish human rights protection mechanisms under the context of climate change. The rise of digital sovereignty presents new demands on traditional state sovereignty and the international legal order, driving the construction of a new international legal order. Through a multidisciplinary perspective, this article provides new insights for theoretical innovation and practical development of international law in the digital age.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technology is profoundly changing global politics, economy, and social structures, while also presenting unprecedented challenges to traditional concepts and orders of international law. The three fields of artificial intelligence, climate change, and digital sovereignty not only individually demonstrate the complexity of international law but also drive the reshaping and innovation of international law through cross-interaction. This article aims to explore the challenges and opportunities of international law in the digital age from these three perspectives and propose suggestions for building a more fair, transparent, and adaptive new international legal order.</p>

            <h2>I. Algorithm Governance and International Rule of Law in the Era of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Legal Challenges of Algorithm Governance</h3>
            <p>The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has brought many legal and ethical challenges, the most prominent of which are algorithmic discrimination, data privacy, and accountability mechanisms for automated decision-making. Algorithms often rely on historical data in decision-making processes, which may contain biases and discrimination, leading to unfair phenomena unintentionally perpetuated by the algorithms. For example, in areas such as recruitment, loan approval, and criminal justice, algorithmic discrimination has become a serious problem, attracting widespread public attention and controversy.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Principles of Algorithm Governance under the International Law Framework</h3>
            <p>Facing the challenges brought by artificial intelligence, the existing international law framework is obviously insufficient in adaptability and specificity. Establishing specialized principles for algorithm governance has become an urgent need. The transparency principle requires the decision-making process of artificial intelligence systems to be open to relevant parties, including data sources, algorithmic logic, and decision-making basis. The interpretability principle is an extension of the transparency principle, requiring the decision-making process of artificial intelligence systems to be understandable and explicable by humans.</p>

            <h2>II. Human Rights Protection Mechanisms under the Context of Climate Change</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Specific Impacts of Climate Change on Human Rights</h3>
            <p>The impact of climate change on human rights is multi-layered, affecting life, health, development, and cultural rights. Rising sea levels and frequent extreme weather events directly threaten people's life and health rights. For example, countries like Bangladesh face enormous migration pressure due to sea level rise, while extreme heat exacerbates health risks for the elderly and children.</p>
            <h3>2.2 Shortcomings of the Existing International Law System</h3>
            <p>Although international legal documents such as the "Framework Convention on Climate Change" and the "Paris Agreement" provide frameworks for addressing climate change, their limitations in safeguarding human rights are still significant. These documents lack clear accountability mechanisms for human rights violations and do not fully consider the vulnerabilities of different regions and groups.</p>

            <h2>III. The Reshaping of Digital Sovereignty and the Evolution of the International Legal Order</h2>
            <h3>3.1 The Connotation and Boundaries of Digital Sovereignty</h3>
            <p>Digital sovereignty refers to a country's autonomous control over its digital space, digital resources, and digital activities. It includes data governance, cybersecurity, digital trade, and other aspects, extending and expanding traditional state sovereignty in the digital age. The characteristics of digital sovereignty include technological dependency, global interconnectivity, and dynamic evolution.</p>
            <h3>3.2 Challenges of Digital Sovereignty to Traditional International Legal Order</h3>
            <p>The development of digital technology challenges traditional principles of state sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs. The cross-border nature of data flow and the covert nature of cyber attacks make it difficult for countries to control their digital space, challenging the traditional principle of state sovereignty. Additionally, the development of digital technology makes information dissemination and political intervention more convenient, and some countries use digital technology to interfere in the internal affairs of others, posing a challenge to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The arrival of the digital age brings unprecedented challenges and opportunities to international law. By constructing transparent, interpretable, fair, and responsible principles for algorithm governance, we can effectively address the challenges brought by artificial intelligence. At the same time, incorporating human rights principles into climate change negotiations and compliance mechanisms, and establishing human rights protection mechanisms under the context of climate change, are urgent tasks for the international community. Furthermore, the rise of digital sovereignty drives the construction of a new international legal order, providing legal guarantees for peace and development in the digital age.</p>
