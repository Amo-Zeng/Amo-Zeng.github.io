            <h2>Paradigm Shift in Energy Economics: From Value Co-creation to Social Equity</h2>
            <p>Energy economics is undergoing a profound paradigm shift, not only involving technological innovation and restructuring of industrial chains but also addressing social equity and environmental protection. Against the backdrop of global energy transition and the rapid development of digital technology, the traditional energy economic model can no longer cope with increasingly complex challenges, giving rise to new research perspectives and practical pathways. This article will explore the new paradigm of energy economics from three dimensions: value co-creation, energy finance innovation, and energy poverty, and propose suggestions for building a fairer and more sustainable energy system.</p>

            <h3>I. Value Co-creation and Industrial Chain Restructuring: Technological and Market Innovation in Energy Economics</h3>
            <p>The traditional energy economic model is commodity-centric, with clear boundaries between energy producers and consumers, and a relatively simple value chain. However, with the rise of new energy technologies, distributed energy, and the energy internet, the interactivity and synergy of energy systems have significantly increased, making the traditional linear value creation model inadequate for the new context.</p>
            <p><strong>Value co-creation</strong> emphasizes the joint creation of value by multiple participants in the energy value chain, breaking the boundaries of traditional energy production and consumption. Its core concepts include user participation, data-driven decision-making, and ecosystem collaboration. Users are no longer merely passive recipients of energy products and services but actively participate in the production, storage, and consumption of energy, such as through rooftop photovoltaic installations and demand response programs, transforming into energy "prosumers." Digital technologies enable real-time data collection, analysis, and sharing, optimizing energy production, transmission, and consumption, enhancing system efficiency and user satisfaction. Energy companies, technology providers, government departments, and users collaborate to build efficient, clean, and intelligent energy ecosystems, achieving resource sharing, complementary advantages, and value co-creation.</p>

            <h3>II. Energy Finance Innovation: Addressing Environmental Risks and Promoting Green Transition</h3>
            <p>As global climate change intensifies and energy environmental risks increase, the focus of energy economics research has gradually shifted toward how financial innovation can address these challenges and drive the global economy toward green and low-carbon transformation. The physical risks of climate change, transition risks of energy transformation, and compliance risks of environmental policies pose severe challenges to the traditional financial system. Traditional financial instruments struggle to accurately assess and quantify environmental risks, leading to distorted risk pricing and increased market volatility. Green investments have long回报 periods and high risks, making them unattractive to traditional financial institutions, which stifles green technological innovation and the development of low-carbon industries due to funding constraints.</p>
            <p>To address energy environmental risks, financial innovation is imperative. In recent years, a series of green financial innovation tools and practices have emerged globally, providing new ideas and solutions for managing energy environmental risks. Environmental risk assessment and disclosure tools, green financial products and services, carbon market mechanisms, and the application of fintech are all supporting green transition. For example, the development of green bonds, green funds, and green insurance channels social capital into low-carbon and environmental protection sectors; the development of carbon emission trading markets promotes carbon reduction through market mechanisms; the use of big data, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other fintech tools enhances environmental risk management efficiency and reduces the transaction costs of green finance.</p>

            <h3>III. Energy Poverty: Social Injustice and Governance Challenges Under Power Structures</h3>
            <p>Energy poverty is not merely about "lack of electricity and gas" but a concentrated manifestation of the structural disadvantages of certain minority groups in the distribution of energy resources in modern society, and it is also a concrete representation of social inequality in the energy sector. The multidimensional interpretation of energy poverty includes economic dimensions (the impact of rising energy prices on the cost of living for low-income groups), social dimensions (inadequate energy infrastructure leading to unstable energy supply in remote areas and for migrant populations), environmental dimensions (dependence on traditional biomass energy by energy-poor groups, causing indoor air pollution and harming health), and technological dimensions (lack of awareness and access to clean energy technologies, making it difficult to benefit from the dividends of energy technological progress).</p>
            <p>The root of energy poverty lies in social power structures of inequality. Uneven wealth distribution, institutional discrimination, and market failures all exacerbate inequality in energy access. Wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, and the development and pricing power of energy resources are also in the hands of a few capitalists, further exacerbating inequality in energy access. Energy policies often overlook the needs of vulnerable groups, such as grid extensions favoring economically developed areas and energy subsidy policies failing to effectively benefit low-income groups. Inadequate competition in the energy market leads to distorted price signals, making it difficult for low-income groups to afford high energy prices.</p>

            <h3>IV. Building a Fair and Sustainable Energy System: From Theory to Practice</h3>
            <p>The paradigm shift in energy economics requires not only technological innovation and market mechanism improvement but also a perspective of social equity. Value co-creation and industrial chain restructuring provide new paths for technological progress and market innovation in the energy system, while energy financial innovation provides funding support and risk management tools for green transition. However, the ultimate goal of these changes should be to eliminate energy poverty and achieve social equity.</p>
            <p>To build a fairer and more sustainable energy system, efforts from government, market, and society are needed. The government should strengthen policy guidance and support, formulate more comprehensive green financial policies and regulations, clarify the development goals of green finance, improve the green financial standard system, and create a favorable policy environment for green finance development. The market should promote energy market reform, enhance competition, lower energy prices, and improve the accessibility and affordability of energy services. Society should strengthen public education and awareness, enhance public understanding of climate change and environmental issues, advocate green consumption and investment concepts, and create a positive social atmosphere for green finance development.</p>

            <h3>V. Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The paradigm shift in energy economics is a complex and systematic project that requires coordinated efforts from technology, market, policy, and society. Value co-creation and industrial chain restructuring provide new paths for technological progress and market innovation in the energy system, while energy financial innovation provides funding support and risk management tools for green transition, and energy poverty governance aims to eliminate inequality in energy access and achieve social equity. Through these multidimensional collaborative efforts, we can build a clean, low-carbon, safe, efficient, fair, and inclusive modern energy system, contributing wisdom and strength to global sustainable development.</p>
