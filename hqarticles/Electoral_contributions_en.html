            <h2>Crisis of Sovereignty in the Global Age: Starting with the Influence of Multinational Corporations and Foreign Powers on National Elections</h2>
            <p>The wave of globalization has swept across the world, with multinational corporations and foreign powers increasingly penetrating economic, political, and cultural domains. Their influence on national sovereignties, especially electoral politics, has grown day by day. Examining this phenomenon from a "global perspective," we cannot help but ask: how can a country maintain the independence and purity of its elections in an open international environment? What long-term impacts will the interference of multinational corporations and foreign powers have on global politics?</p>

            <h3>Echo Chambers: The Cage of Cognition</h3>
            <p>The concept of echo chambers is not new, but algorithmic recommendation mechanisms on social media platforms have taken it to an extreme. We are immersed in information bubbles built on our own preferences, continually receiving information that aligns with our existing views. Content that challenges or disrupts our established beliefs is systematically filtered and blocked. This "echo chamber effect" makes our political views increasingly extreme and rigid, making it difficult to accept different voices, let alone engage in rational debate.</p>

            <h3>Donations: From Charity to Political Projection</h3>
            <p>Under the influence of echo chambers, donation behavior gradually deviates from its original charitable purpose, becoming a tool for political projection. We tend to donate money to organizations or individuals we endorse, which often represent our political positions and values. Through donations, we not only support forces that align with our views materially but also reinforce our own identification with specific political issues mentally.</p>

            <h3>Election Interference by Multinational Corporations: Political Expression of Economic Power</h3>
            <p>As economic giants in the global age, multinational corporations control vast capital, technology, and market resources. They are no longer content with pursuing simple economic interests but seek political discourse to safeguard and expand their interests globally. Influencing election results has become an important means of expressing their political demands.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Political Contributions and Lobbying</strong>: Multinational corporations provide substantial political contributions to candidates and political parties, hire professional lobbying teams, influence election agendas and policy directions, and safeguard their interests in taxation, trade, and labor.</li>
                <li><strong>Media Manipulation and Public Opinion Guidance</strong>: Leveraging their control over media resources, multinational corporations can create public opinion hotspots, guide public attention to specific issues, influence voters' perceptions and judgments, and thereby manipulate election outcomes.</li>
                <li><strong>NGOs and Think Tanks</strong>: Multinational corporations fund non-governmental organizations and think tanks to export their values and policy propositions, influence the political agendas and decision-making processes of target countries, and serve their political objectives.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Election Interference by Foreign Powers: Continuation and Game of Geopolitics</h3>
            <p>Interference by foreign powers in national elections often carries stronger geopolitical overtones, with the ultimate goal of safeguarding their own interests, undermining opponents, or even overthrowing other countries' regimes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intelligence Agencies and Cyber Attacks</strong>: Some countries use their intelligence agencies and cyber attack capabilities to steal political secrets of target countries, spread disinformation, disrupt election processes, and achieve their goals of interfering with election outcomes.</li>
                <li><strong>Proxy Wars and Color Revolutions</strong>: Some countries support opposition forces, fund opposition activities, or even directly plan color revolutions to overthrow regimes that do not meet their interests and achieve their geopolitical goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanctions and Pressure</strong>: Some countries use their economic, military, and diplomatic advantages to impose sanctions and pressure on target countries, forcing them to make choices in elections that align with their interests, or face more severe sanctions and isolation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How Donations Shape Political Views</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Reinforcing Existing Perceptions</strong>: When we choose to donate to specific organizations, it is usually because the organization's ideas align with our political views. This behavior itself signifies our recognition and reinforcement of these views, further solidifying our positions within the echo chamber.</li>
                <li><strong>Building Identity</strong>: Donation behavior can be seen as an expression of identity. By supporting specific political issues or candidates, we label ourselves with certain political tags and connect with others who hold similar views, forming a closer "identity group."</li>
                <li><strong>Influencing Political Ecosystem</strong>: Donations are not merely individual actions; they also impact the entire political ecosystem. The influx of large amounts of money can provide support for specific issues or candidates, influence policy-making and election results, and thus shape the direction of political views on a broader scale.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Breaking Echo Chambers, Returning to Rationality</h3>
            <p>To break the negative impact of echo chambers on donation behavior, we need to return to rationality and think more deeply about donation behavior:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Seek Information from Multiple Sources</strong>: Actively step out of the comfort zone and access information from different perspectives to avoid being misled by a single voice.</li>
                <li><strong>Rationally Analyze Motives</strong>: Before donating, calmly consider your motives—is it for charity or to reinforce your political stance?</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on Long-term Effects</strong>: Not only pay attention to the immediate donation behavior but also consider its long-term impacts on society and the political ecosystem, avoiding short-sighted political games.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Faced with the interference of multinational corporations and foreign powers, how to maintain the independence and purity of national elections has become an important challenge for governments around the world:</p>

                <li><strong>Improve Election Systems and Strengthen Legal Regulation</strong>: Countries should further refine election laws and regulations, strengthen supervision over political contributions, lobbying activities, and media manipulation, and crack down on various forms of electoral fraud and foreign interference.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhance National Security Awareness and Build Cybersecurity Defenses</strong>: Countries should strengthen national security awareness education, improve public辨识能力 of cyber attacks and disinformation, and enhance cybersecurity construction to build a robust defense against cyber attacks.</li>
