            <h2>The New Vitality of Natural Law</h2>
            <p>In the complex context of contemporary society, the ancient and noble concept of natural law is gradually exhibiting new vitality and practical significance. From environmental protection from an ecological perspective to ethical challenges in cutting-edge technology, and from international governance under globalization, the universality and moral principles of natural law provide us with a crucial perspective for examining and solving modern issues.</p>

            <h3>Natural Law from an Ecological Perspective</h3>
            <p>Natural law, originating from the thoughts of ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle and the Stoics, advocates that laws should reflect the fundamental order and moral principles of nature. In the context of contemporary environmental issues, the concept of natural law has been imbued with new life, expanding to the protection of ecosystems and biodiversity, emphasizing that laws should respect and protect the intrinsic value and integrity of natural systems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ecosystem Protection:</strong> Extending the concept of natural law to ecosystem protection requires us to incorporate ecological balance considerations in lawmaking.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Sustainable Development:</strong> Emphasizing global sustainable development demands international cooperation and legal agreements to address global environmental issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss.</li>
                <li><strong>Protecting Endangered Species:</strong> Laws should明确规定 protection measures for endangered species, including prohibiting illegal trade, establishing reserves, and conducting scientific research to understand and protect these species.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Balance:</strong> The ecological perspective of natural law requires us to recognize that nature is not merely an endless provider of resources but a complex network of life with intrinsic value and interrelationships.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Natural Law in Technology Ethics</h3>
            <p>With the rapid development of cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and gene editing, we are standing at the threshold of a new era. These technological advancements not only bring unprecedented convenience to humanity but also raise profound ethical and legal issues. In this context, the principles of natural law serve as an important perspective for examining issues in technology ethics, requiring us to uphold moral boundaries in technological development and ensure that the application of technology does not contravene the moral foundation of natural law.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Formulating Proactive Regulations:</strong> Laws should anticipate potential risks in technological development and establish relevant regulations in advance to ensure the safety and ethics of technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing International Cooperation:</strong> Technological development often transcends national boundaries, making international legal cooperation crucial for ensuring global technological ethics.</li>
                <li><strong>Protecting Human Dignity:</strong> Laws should明确规定 that technological applications must not threaten human dignity, including prohibiting non-therapeutic gene editing and protecting personal data privacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoiding Irreversible Damage to Nature:</strong> Laws should restrict applications of technology that could lead to ecosystem damage, ensuring technological development is harmonized with environmental protection.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Natural Law in Global Governance</h3>
            <p>As globalization sweeps across the world today, the ancient and profound philosophical concept of natural law is gradually gaining new vitality. It is not only the cornerstone of legal philosophy but also the beacon of global governance, guiding the direction of international law and policy formulation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Universality:</strong> Natural law advocates a universal moral code transcending national borders and cultures, rooted in humanity's understanding of natural order and asserting the existence of a moral law superior to positive law.</li>
                <li><strong>International Cooperation:</strong> The principles of natural law play a significant role in promoting international cooperation, providing a moral and legal foundation for the international community.</li>
                <li><strong>Addressing International Trade and Human Rights Issues:</strong> Natural law also demonstrates unique value in addressing international trade and human rights issues, helping balance national interests and global public interests.</li>
            </ul>
