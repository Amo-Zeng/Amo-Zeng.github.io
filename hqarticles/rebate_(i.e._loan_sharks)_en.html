            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As a traditional monetary policy tool of central banks, rediscount has long been primarily used to regulate the money supply and interest rate levels. However, with the increasing complexity and uncertainty in the global financial markets, the role of rediscount is gradually shifting, being used more frequently to maintain financial stability. This article will explore the multiple roles and future development trends of rediscount in the current financial environment from three new perspectivesâ€”the transformation from a monetary policy tool to a financial stabilizer, technological empowerment and innovative development in the digital era, and green rediscount guiding capital flow towards a low-carbon economy.</p>

            <h3>From Monetary Policy Tool to Financial Stabilizer</h3>
            <h4>Traditional Role of Rediscount</h4>
            <p>Rediscount is a short-term loan provided by the central bank to commercial banks, where commercial banks can pledge their holdings to the central bank to obtain financial support. By adjusting the rediscount rate and rediscount quota, the central bank can influence market interest rates and the money supply, thereby achieving monetary policy objectives. The traditional role of rediscount is mainly reflected in the following aspects:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Regulating Money Supply</strong>: The central bank influences the financing costs of commercial banks by adjusting the rediscount rate, which in turn affects market interest rates and the money supply.</li>
                <li><strong>Controlling Market Interest Rates</strong>: The rediscount rate is generally considered the benchmark interest rate in the market, and its changes directly impact market interest rates.</li>
                <li><strong>Liquidity Support</strong>: Rediscount provides commercial banks with an important channel for liquidity support.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>New Role of Rediscount in Financial Stability</h4>
            <p>In recent years, the function of rediscount has gradually shifted from a purely monetary policy tool to a financial stabilizer. The following are several key aspects:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Addressing Financial Risks</strong>: During financial crises or market turmoil, rediscount can provide liquidity support to commercial banks, preventing bank runs and systemic risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Supporting the Real Economy</strong>: Rediscount can help businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), obtain financing and support the development of the real economy.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting Financial Stability</strong>: Rediscount can serve as a financial stability tool, helping to mitigate market volatility and liquidity stress.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Case Studies</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>US Rediscount Window</strong>: The Federal Reserve's rediscount window played a crucial role in addressing the financial crisis.</li>
                <li><strong>Chinese Rediscount Policy</strong>: The People's Bank of China supports SME financing through rediscount, alleviating the financing difficulties faced by enterprises.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Future Development Trends and Optimization Paths</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Transparency and Operability</strong>: Rediscount operations should be more transparent, with clear conditions and procedures for rediscount.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening Risk Management</strong>: Rediscount operations should be integrated with other financial stability tools to form a comprehensive governance system.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting International Cooperation</strong>: Rediscount policy should enhance international cooperation to jointly address the uncertainties and risks in the global financial market.</li>
            </ol>
