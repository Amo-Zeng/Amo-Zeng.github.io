            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Pushed by the global technological wave, the field of drug quality control is undergoing profound changes. The convergence of cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, and the concept of Green Pharma is not only enhancing the safety and effectiveness of drugs but also opening new paths for sustainability and social responsibility. This article will delve into how these technologies are reshaping drug quality control, analyze their underlying innovation logic and potential challenges, and look forward to future development directions.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Main Body</h2>
            <h3>1. Artificial Intelligence and Big Data: From Automation to Intelligent Quality Control Revolution</h3>
            <p>The combination of AI and Big Data is pushing drug quality control from traditional static detection to intelligent dynamic management. Through real-time data collection and deep learning algorithms, AI can uncover hidden patterns from massive data and predict potential quality risks. For example, AI can analyze historical production data to identify critical variables that may cause drug quality fluctuations (such as temperature, humidity, or raw material batch differences) and adjust production parameters in real time to ensure consistency.</p>
            <p>In the field of intelligent detection, the application of machine vision technology has become a powerful tool for drug quality control. Traditional visual inspection relies on manual labor, susceptible to subjective factors, while AI-driven machine vision systems can complete drug packaging crack detection, label recognition, and foreign object detection at millisecond speeds. This highly accurate and efficient detection method not only reduces the incidence of human error but also significantly boosts production line efficiency.</p>
            <p>However, the application of AI technology is not without challenges. Its core depends on the accuracy and completeness of the data, and complex environmental variables involved in drug production may lead to data bias. Additionally, the "black box" nature of AI algorithms raises concerns about the transparency and interpretability of its decisions. Ensuring transparency in regulatory frameworks while encouraging technological innovation is a pressing issue for the future.</p>

            <h3>2. Blockchain: Reconstructing the Trust Foundation of the Drug Supply Chain</h3>
            <p>Blockchain technology offers a new trust mechanism for drug quality control through its decentralized and tamper-proof features. In the drug supply chain, Blockchain records every step from raw material procurement, production, to transportation and sale, forming an unalterable digital archive. This transparency not only makes tracing problematic drugs possible but also effectively curbs the circulation of counterfeit and substandard drugs.</p>
            <p>Taking IBM's collaboration with Walgreens as an example, through Blockchain technology, every participant in the drug supply chain—from pharmaceutical factories to logistics companies to retailers—is included in a unified digital network. Information such as the source, production date, and transportation conditions of each batch of drugs is recorded on the Blockchain in real time, and consumers can verify the authenticity of the drug by scanning a QR code. This technology not only enhances the credibility of drugs but also provides an efficient data tracking tool for regulatory agencies.</p>
            <p>However, the widespread adoption of Blockchain technology still faces some practical challenges. Firstly, the construction and maintenance costs of Blockchain systems are high, which may be unaffordable for small and medium-sized pharmaceutical companies. Secondly, performance issues (such as transaction speed and storage capacity) of Blockchain may become a bottleneck when dealing with large-scale drug supply chains. In the future, how to reduce costs and improve efficiency through technological innovations will be key to the widespread application of Blockchain technology in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

            <h3>3. Green Pharma: From Drug Production to Sustainable Development</h3>
            <p>The concept of Green Pharma is not only a revolution in production methods but also a commitment to social responsibility and environmental protection. By reducing resource consumption and lowering environmental pollution, Green Pharma is achieving a win-win situation for drug quality control and sustainable development.</p>
            <p>Clean production technology is at the core of Green Pharma. For example, closed-loop production systems recycle and reuse production waste, reducing raw material waste and pollutant emissions. A pharmaceutical company optimized its antibiotic production process, reducing waste emissions by 30% while improving drug purity and stability. The application of green analytical methods is equally remarkable, such as High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), which enhances detection efficiency and reduces environmental burden by minimizing the use of toxic reagents.</p>
            <p>The introduction of biotechnology has opened new directions for Green Pharma. Drugs produced through genetic engineering and enzyme engineering not only have higher efficacy but also reduce the use of chemical reagents and environmental risks during production. For instance, insulin produced using microbial fermentation technology significantly reduces chemical pollution compared to traditional production methods while improving production efficiency.</p>
            <p>However, the promotion of Green Pharma is not without obstacles. The core challenge lies in the high costs and long cycles of technological innovation. Many green pharmaceutical technologies are still in the experimental stage and have not achieved large-scale commercialization. Additionally, pharmaceutical companies need to balance economic benefits with environmental protection, which requires both policy support and market incentives.</p>

            <h2>Case Analysis</h2>
            <h3>1. Pfizer's AI Application: From Detection to Predictive Intelligence</h3>
            <p>Pfizer introduced an AI-based intelligent detection system in drug production, utilizing machine vision technology to automate drug packaging inspection. Combined with a big data platform, the system can not only analyze real-time detection data but also predict potential quality issues, achieving a smart transformation from "detection" to "prediction." This case demonstrates the enormous potential of AI technology in drug quality control.</p>

            <h3>2. IBM and Walgreens' Blockchain Collaboration: Building a Trust Network in the Drug Supply Chain</h3>
            <p>IBM's collaboration with Walgreens uses Blockchain technology to build a drug traceability system, ensuring the transparency and security of the drug supply chain. This system not only helps consumers verify the authenticity of drugs but also provides an efficient data tracking tool for regulatory agencies, showcasing the practical application value of Blockchain in drug quality control.</p>

            <h3>3. A Pharmaceutical Company's Green Practice: From Process Optimization to Environmental Friendliness</h3>
            <p>A pharmaceutical company optimized its antibiotic production process through clean production technology and green analytical methods, reducing waste emissions and reagent usage.
