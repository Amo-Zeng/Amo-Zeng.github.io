            <h3>I. Glocalization: The New Norm for Brands and Starbucks, McDonald's Winning Strategies</h3>
            <p>The wave of globalization has swept across the world, and brand expansion is no longer just about crossing borders with products but also about transmitting culture and values. However, cultural differences, consumption habits, and regulatory policies pose significant obstacles to global brand expansion. Facing this challenge, the "glocalization" strategy has emerged as a powerful tool for brands to conquer global markets.</p>
            <h4>1. The Concept and Challenges of Glocalization</h4>
            <p>Glocalization is not a simple compromise between globalization and localization but a deep integration:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Globalization:</strong> Pursuing scale effects, unified standards, and brand value transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>Localization:</strong> Respecting local culture, adapting to consumption habits, and meeting personalized needs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, achieving true glocalization is not easy; brands need to overcome the following challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cultural Differences:</strong> Cultural customs, values, and consumption psychology vary greatly between different countries and regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Environment:</strong> Each country has different legal policies, economic levels, and competitive landscapes.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Change:</strong> The rapid development of the digital age brings new consumption patterns and communication methods.</li>
            </ul>
