            <h2>Common Ground</h2>
            <p>Both contents focus on the cross-disciplinary applications of photocatalytic materials, exploring their potential in environmental and health monitoring, as well as in material design optimization. Both emphasize the necessity of improving material performance (such as expanding the photoresponse range and enhancing stability) and achieving flexible integration. Both also involve the coupling of photocatalytic and sensing functions, such as self-powered photodriven systems and real-time data analysis.</p>

            <h2>Differences</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Focus:</strong> The first article (wearable devices) emphasizes practical deployment, such as air pollution monitoring, biomarker detection, and antibacterial dressings; the second article (AI-driven systems) focuses on material development and efficiency optimization, accelerating the design of new photocatalysts and dynamically controlling reaction conditions through algorithms.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Emphasis:</strong> The first article focuses on hardware integration of flexible electronics and sensors, addressing challenges such as stretchability and comfort; the second article emphasizes AI's role in analyzing catalytic mechanisms (e.g., optimizing electronic migration pathways) and data-driven material screening.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cross-Disciplinary Synergies</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>AI-Assisted Flexible Material Design:</strong> Combining AI prediction algorithms with flexible electronics can lead to the development of highly stable stretchable photocatalysts (e.g., graphene-based composites), which maintain activity even under bending conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Sensing and Feedback Systems:</strong> AI can analyze real-time signals from photocatalytic sensors (e.g., gas concentration, UV intensity) and dynamically adjust catalytic efficiency or trigger warning systems, forming a feedback loop of "monitoring-treatment-response".</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental-Health Integrated Applications:</strong> Integrating AI-optimized high-efficiency photocatalytic materials into wearable devices, for example, by improving the structure of TiOâ‚‚ for enhanced visible light response, could enable masks or clothing to simultaneously degrade pollutants and monitor health indicators under illumination.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Future Directions</h2>
            <p>We must overcome the balance between material stability and photocatalytic efficiency, accelerate the iteration of flexible photocatalysts with AI, and promote integration with wireless communication and edge computing, ultimately building an intelligent wearable ecosystem with strong environmental adaptability. For example, AI-driven self-powered sensors could be embedded in urban infrastructure to realize real-time pollution monitoring and treatment coordination.</p>
