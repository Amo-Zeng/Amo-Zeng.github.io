            <h2>The Multidimensional Paradigm Shift in Rehabilitation Medicine</h2>
            <p>Rehabilitation medicine, an essential component of the modern healthcare system, has long been regarded as the discipline for repairing damaged functions. However, with advancements in technology, deeper humanistic care, and diversified patient needs, rehabilitation medicine is undergoing a profound paradigm shift. This shift moves from "repair" to "empowerment," from "passive treatment" to "active participation," and from "single-profession" to "interdisciplinary collaboration." These changes not only alter the practice of rehabilitation medicine but also offer patients broader possibilities.</p>
