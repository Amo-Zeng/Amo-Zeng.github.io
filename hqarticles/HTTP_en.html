            <h2>HTTP's Multiple Roles: From Data Transmission to the Nexus of Application Ecosystem</h2>
            <h3>More Than Just Data Transmission: HTTP's Protocol Features Enable Greater Possibilities</h3>
            <p>The HTTP protocol itself possesses many features, which make HTTP not only limited to data transmission but also play an important role in modern web applications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statelessness</strong>: HTTP's stateless nature means that the server does not need to save client state information, simplifying server design and improving scalability. This has also spawned technologies such as Cookies and Sessions to implement stateful session management on top of the stateless HTTP protocol.</li>
                <li><strong>Extensibility</strong>: The extensibility of HTTP headers allows developers to pass additional information by customizing header fields, such as authentication information and caching control policies, providing possibilities for building feature-rich web applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Rich Status Codes</strong>: HTTP defines a rich set of status codes to represent the results of request processing, such as 200 for success and 404 for resource not found. These status codes provide clear semantics for communication between the client and server, facilitating error handling and logical judgment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>HTTP's Multiple Roles in Modern Web Applications</h3>
            <p>Based on the features of the HTTP protocol, it plays the following multiple roles in modern web applications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Layer Protocol</strong>: HTTP is the foundation protocol of web applications, responsible for data transmission between the client and server. Whether browsing web pages, submitting forms, or making API calls, HTTP is indispensable.</li>
                <li><strong>API Interface</strong>: RESTful APIs have become the mainstream way to build web services, and RESTful APIs are built on the HTTP protocol. HTTP's request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes, and header fields are fully utilized to define the semantics and behavior of API interfaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Caching Mechanism</strong>: HTTP defines a rich caching mechanism, such as Cache-Control and ETag, which can effectively reduce network transmission and improve the performance and user experience of web applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Mechanism</strong>: The HTTPS protocol adds an SSL/TLS encryption layer on top of HTTP to ensure the security of data during transmission. Additionally, HTTP header fields like CSP (Content Security Policy) and HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) also provide multi-layer security protection for web applications.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Practical Application Scenarios</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>E-commerce Platforms</strong>: In e-commerce platforms, HTTP is not only used to display product information but also to handle user purchase requests and payment operations. RESTful APIs can conveniently implement functions such as product queries, shopping cart management, and order processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Media Websites</strong>: On social media websites, HTTP is used to transmit user dynamics, comments, likes, and other data. Through the caching mechanism of the HTTP protocol, the burden on the server can be effectively reduced, improving user access speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Online Education Platforms</strong>: In online education platforms, HTTP is used to transmit course videos, lecture notes, quizzes, and other content. Through the HTTPS protocol, the security of user learning data during transmission can be ensured.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Revolution of HTTP/3: Farewell to TCP, Welcome QUIC for Performance Leap</h2>
            <h3>TCP's Bottlenecks and Challenges</h3>
            <p>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), as the cornerstone of the internet, has been the primary protocol for data transmission since its inception in 1974. However, with the diversification of internet applications and the increase in user demands, TCP's inherent flaws have gradually become apparent:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complex Handshake Process</strong>: TCP's three-way handshake results in significant latency, especially in high-latency or unstable network environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Slow Congestion Control Response</strong>: TCP's congestion control mechanism reacts slowly to sudden traffic, easily causing network congestion and thereby affecting user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Connection State</strong>: TCP's connection state is global, and a problem in one connection can affect the performance of the entire connection, which is particularly evident in scenarios with multiplexing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Rise of QUIC: The New Life of UDP</h3>
            <p>QUIC is a transport protocol developed by Google based on UDP, aimed at solving many of the problems of TCP in modern network environments. The design philosophy of QUIC is "fast" and "flexible," by reducing the connection establishment time, providing more efficient congestion control and multiplexing mechanisms, significantly improving network transmission performance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>0-RTT Connection Establishment</strong>: QUIC can carry application data in the first data packet, greatly reducing connection establishment latency.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiplexing Mechanism</strong>: QUIC provides independent congestion control and error recovery mechanisms for each data stream, ensuring that a problem in one data stream does not affect others, thereby improving overall transmission efficiency and stability.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Revolutionary Changes of HTTP/3</h3>
            <p>HTTP/3 is the new generation HTTP standard based on the QUIC protocol, inheriting many of QUIC's advantages and further optimizing the performance and security of web communication:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption Integration</strong>: In HTTP/3, encryption and transmission are tightly integrated in the QUIC protocol, simplifying the protocol stack and improving the efficiency of encryption and decryption.</li>
                <li><strong>Powerful Flow Control Mechanism</strong>: QUIC's flow control is based on each data stream, making flow control more refined and flexible.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient Error Recovery Mechanism</strong>: QUIC can quickly recover from data packet loss without the need for TCP to retransmit the entire sequence of data packets.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Performance Leap: The Practical Impact of HTTP/3</h3>
            <p>The introduction of HTTP/3 has brought significant performance improvements. According to test data from companies such as Google and Cloudflare, HTTP/3 excels in reducing page load times, improving video streaming quality, and lowering latency. Especially in mobile networks and high-latency network environments, HTTP/3's advantages are even more pronounced.</p>
