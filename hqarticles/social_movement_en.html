            <h2>Social Movements: Revolutionizing Brain, Technological Power, and Complex System Evolution</h2>
            <p>Throughout human civilization, social movements have acted as a sharp scalpel, continuously reshaping human biology and society. These movements are not merely political, economic, or cultural changes; they are profound neural rewiring projects, redefinitions of technological power, and the self-organization, emergence, and evolution of complex systems.</p>

            <h3>Neural Rewiring: Emotional Resonance and Revolutionary Changes in Social Cognition</h3>
            <p>Social movements are, first and foremost, a large-scale experiment in emotional resonance. Tens of thousands of individuals gather, emotions surge within the crowd, triggering group emotional resonance. This resonance activates a unique brain pattern: widespread activation of mirror neurons, enabling individuals to perceive and understand others' emotional states.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emotional Resonance:</strong> Group emotional resonance reshapes the structure and function of the limbic system.</li>
                <li><strong>Neural Rewiring:</strong> Group interactions within social movements activate brain plasticity mechanisms, particularly in areas related to learning, memory, and social cognition.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Cognition:</strong> New neural network connections enable individuals to better understand complex group dynamics, forming new social decision-making abilities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technology and Power: The Arena for Reconstructing Social Relations</h3>
            <p>For a long time, technology has been regarded as a neutral tool. However, from the perspective of social movements, technology is far from neutral; it is a container that carries specific social relations and power structures. Since the Industrial Revolution, the collusion between technology and capital has gradually emerged, with technology being alienated into a tool for extracting surplus value.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Technology and Capital:</strong> Technology is alienated into a tool for extracting surplus value, with workers' labor being mechanized and standardized.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Power:</strong> The development of digital technology further confirms the continuity and evolution of the relationship between technology and power.</li>
                <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Grassroots communities' "hacktivism" and "open-source movements" demonstrate the potential of technology in decentralization and democratization.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Complex Systems Perspective: Self-Organization, Emergence, and Evolution of Social Movements</h3>
            <p>Social movements, as complex systems, are characterized by being composed of numerous heterogeneous agents with complex interactions. The self-organization of social movements manifests in the spontaneous organization and adjustment of the system's structure without central control, through local interactions and information exchange.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Self-Organization:</strong> The self-organization of social movements is evident in the spontaneous organization and adjustment of the system's structure without central control, through local interactions and information exchange.</li>
                <li><strong>Emergent Phenomena:</strong> New properties or patterns generated by individual interactions manifest at the system level, such as new organizational forms, collective action strategies, or ideologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Evolutionary Path:</strong> The evolutionary path of social movements exhibits diversity and uncertainty, potentially undergoing processes of expansion from local to global, from small to large scales.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Profound Implications of Social Movements</h3>
            <p>Social movements activate brain plasticity, reshaping social cognitive abilities; technology, in collusion with power, becomes a carrier of social relations and power structures; and social movements, as complex systems, exhibit self-organization, emergence, and evolutionary characteristics. These perspectives not only help us better understand the deep significance and impact of social movements but also provide new ideas and methods for future social change.</p>
