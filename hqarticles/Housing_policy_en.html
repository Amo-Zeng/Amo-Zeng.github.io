            <h2>Current Status and Challenges of Housing Management in the Digital Age</h2>
            <p>Under the impetus of the current digital wave, the housing management system is also facing unprecedented opportunities for transformation. Traditional housing management models, whether in terms of data integration, management efficiency, or service experience, have shown their limitations. The rapid development of digital technologies has provided new tools and methods for housing management, making the construction of a smart housing management system possible. Through the deep integration of big data, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and blockchain technologies, housing management can shift from "passive management" to "active service," thereby improving management efficiency and accuracy, and enhancing residents' quality of life.</p>

            <h3>Current Status and Challenges of Housing Management in the Digital Age</h3>
            <p>With the acceleration of urbanization, the complexity of housing management is increasingly growing. Traditional housing management models rely on decentralized, manual data collection and processing methods, leading to several major issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Severe data silos</strong>: Housing-related data is scattered across different departments, such as real estate transactions, rental management, and property management, lacking a unified data sharing mechanism. This not only causes resource waste but also makes government decision-making lack comprehensive and accurate data support.</li>
                <li><strong>Low management efficiency</strong>: Traditional management methods rely on manual operations and paper records, which are prone to problems such as information lag and high error rates, affecting management efficiency and service quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Subpar service experience</strong>: Residents often need to make multiple trips to different departments and submit repetitive materials when dealing with real estate transactions, rentals, property repairs, etc., increasing time and effort costs.</li>
            </ul>
