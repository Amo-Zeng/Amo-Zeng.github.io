                <li><strong>Technological Innovation:</strong> In recent years, technological advancements in nuclear energy, particularly in small modular reactors (SMRs) and molten salt reactors, have opened new pathways for the future development of nuclear energy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Challenges Facing Nuclear Energy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public Perception and Trust:</strong> Despite significant environmental and energy security advantages, the shadows of nuclear accidents like Fukushima and Chernobyl continue to affect public perception of nuclear energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety and Regulation:</strong> The design, construction, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants require extremely stringent regulatory and safety standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Nuclear Proliferation Risks:</strong> Nuclear technology, while used for power generation, can also be misused for military purposes, including the production of nuclear weapons.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Feasibility:</strong> The high construction costs and long construction periods of nuclear power plants make it challenging for nuclear energy to compete with renewable energy sources like wind and solar in the short term.</li>
            </ul>
