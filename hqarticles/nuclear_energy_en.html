            <h2>Nuclear-Powered Smart Cities</h2>
            <p>The construction of smart cities requires a large amount of energy support, especially in areas such as information technology, smart homes, and intelligent transportation. Nuclear power, as an efficient and low-emission energy source, can meet the energy needs of smart cities. Nuclear power generation has high energy density and stability, providing continuous electricity supply, reducing dependence on fossil fuels, and lowering carbon emissions.</p>
            <p>In smart cities, nuclear power can be realized through Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) for distributed power generation. SMRs have the advantages of high safety, short construction periods, and high flexibility, allowing adjustments based on the city's energy needs. Additionally, nuclear power can provide heating and cooling needs for cities through combined heat and power technology, improving energy utilization efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Synergy Between Nuclear Power and Renewable Energy</h2>
            <p>In the energy structure of smart cities, the synergy between nuclear power and renewable energy (such as solar and wind power) is key to achieving stable and efficient energy supply. Nuclear power, as a base load power source, can provide stable electricity supply, while renewable energy, as a supplementary power source, can compensate for the shortcomings of nuclear power.</p>
            <p>For example, nuclear power can provide stable electricity supply at night or during overcast weather, while solar and wind power can provide electricity during the day or when wind conditions are favorable. Through smart grid technology, the coordinated dispatch of nuclear power and renewable energy can be achieved, optimizing energy utilization efficiency and reducing the volatility of electricity supply.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, nuclear power can support energy storage systems for renewable energy. For example, electricity generated by nuclear power can be used to charge battery storage systems, ensuring stable electricity supply when renewable energy sources are insufficient.</p>

            <h2>Application of Nuclear Power in Intelligent Transportation</h2>
            <p>Intelligent transportation is an important component of smart cities, and the development of electric vehicles and intelligent transportation systems places new demands on energy supply. Nuclear power, as an efficient energy source, can play a crucial role in electric vehicle charging stations and intelligent transportation systems.</p>
            <p>First, nuclear power can provide stable electricity supply for electric vehicle charging stations. The widespread use of electric vehicles requires a large number of charging facilities, and nuclear power generation has high energy density and stability, meeting the electricity needs of charging stations. Nuclear-powered charging stations can significantly reduce the charging time for electric vehicles, increasing charging efficiency.</p>
            <p>Secondly, nuclear power can provide energy support for intelligent transportation systems. For example, traffic lights, monitoring devices, and smart parking systems in intelligent transportation systems all require stable electricity supply. Nuclear power, as an efficient energy source, can provide continuous power support for these devices, ensuring the normal operation of intelligent transportation systems.</p>

            <h2>Application of Nuclear Power in the Medical Field</h2>
            <p>Nuclear power, as a powerful energy form, is increasingly being applied in the medical field. From the use of radioactive isotopes to improvements in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) equipment, nuclear technology plays a crucial role in diagnosing and treating diseases.</p>
            <p>Nuclear medicine is the field that uses radioactive isotopes for diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, nuclear medicine has made significant progress in cancer treatment. Radioactive isotopes, such as iridium-192 and palladium-103, are widely used in radiation therapy, particularly in the treatment of head and neck cancers and prostate cancer. These isotopes can precisely target cancer cells and release high-energy radiation, killing cancer cells with minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissue.</p>
            <p>Additionally, advancements in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) technology are a significant development in nuclear medicine. PET scans use radioactive tracers, such as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), to detect biochemical changes in the body, helping doctors more accurately diagnose and monitor cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders. The latest PET/CT scanners combine PET and Computed Tomography (CT) technology, providing higher resolution and more accurate images, greatly improving diagnostic accuracy.</p>
            <p>The most prominent example of the application of nuclear power in medical equipment is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) equipment. MRI uses strong magnetic fields and radiofrequency waves to produce high-resolution images of the body, widely applied to imaging of the brain, heart, muscles, and bones. Recent advancements in MRI technology have greatly improved its resolution and scanning speed, providing more precise diagnostic information.</p>
            <p>Moreover, radioactive isotopes are used for the calibration and testing of medical equipment. For example, cesium-137 is used to calibrate and test radiation therapy equipment, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of radiation doses. This is crucial for enhancing the safety and effectiveness of radiation therapy.</p>
            <p>The potential of nuclear power in vaccine and drug development is also being widely explored. Radioactive isotopes can be used to label and track drugs, helping researchers understand the metabolism and distribution of drugs in the body. For example, radioactively labeled drugs can be monitored through PET scans to track their distribution and concentration in the body, helping to optimize drug dosages and administration methods.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, nuclear power can be used in vaccine development. Radioactive isotopes can be used to label antigens of pathogens, helping researchers understand the immune response of vaccines in the body. This is important for developing more effective vaccines.</p>
