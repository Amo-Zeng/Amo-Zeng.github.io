            <h2>Introduction: The Three Symptoms of Digital Mental Distress</h2>
            <p>The psychological distress of the 21st century presents unprecedented complexity: teenagers "scrolling through TikTok until dawn with no memory" (<span class="highlight">digital attachment</span>), Indigenous peoples live-streaming "land-based trauma" (<span class="highlight">ecological unconscious</span>), and survivors of sexual violence "performing trauma" in the #MeToo movement yet facing secondary victimization (<span class="highlight">performative unconscious</span>). These phenomena are not isolated cases, but collectively point to a central issue: <strong>the crisis of subjectivity in the digital age</strong>—how technology, ecology, and platform power systematically reshape human psychological structures through <strong>unconscious mechanisms</strong>.</p>
            <p>Traditional psychoanalysis treats the "unconscious" as an internal, linguistic construct (Freud), or a field of desire within the symbolic order (Lacan). But in the digital ecosystem, the unconscious is no longer confined to the "internal"; it is <strong>restructured by structural forces</strong>: algorithms reshape desire through dopamine mechanisms (<span class="highlight">neuro-symbolic attachment</span>), ecological collapse activates mourning for non-human others (<span class="highlight">ecological unconscious</span>), and platform algorithms transform trauma performance into affective commodities (<span class="highlight">performative unconscious</span>). Together, these form the <strong>digital unconscious</strong> (<strong>digital unconscious</strong>)—a trans-individual, trans-species, trans-media unconscious field co-constituted by technology, ecology, and platform capitalism.</p>
            <p>This article proposes a theoretical framework of the <strong>triple reconstruction of psychoanalysis in the digital age</strong>, integrating the core theories of three in-depth articles to reveal how these three dimensions intersect and form deep interventions on subjectivity. We argue that psychoanalysis must shift from "individual therapy" to "<strong>social-ecological-technological critique</strong>" and develop a new paradigm of <strong>decolonial psychoanalysis</strong> (<strong>decolonial psychoanalysis</strong>) to respond to structural violence in the digital age.</p>

            <h2>Part I: Theoretical Reconstruction—From the "Internal Unconscious" to the "Structural Unconscious"</h2>
            <h3>1.1 The Traditional "Internal Unconscious" Model: From Freud to Lacan</h3>
            <p>Freud (1900) first systematically introduced the concept of the "unconscious" in <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em>, defining it as a "storehouse of repressed desires, traumas, and memories," operating through the "<strong>primary process</strong>": non-logical, atemporal, and imagistic, expressed via mechanisms such as condensation, displacement, and symbolization. This model anchors psychological structure in <strong>individual history</strong>, particularly childhood experience and the Oedipus complex.</p>
            <p>Lacan (1977) restructured the unconscious through the "<strong>mirror stage</strong>" and the "<strong>symbolic order</strong>." He argued that "the unconscious is structured like a language," with its core being the "<strong>gaze of the Other</strong>"—the self-identity constructed through social norms, language, and feedback from others. In Lacan's framework, the unconscious is no longer the "inner realm" of the self, but a product of the <strong>symbolic Other</strong>, structured by the "<strong>big Other</strong>" (the Other).</p>
            <blockquote>
                Yet this model has three limitations:<br>
                1. <strong>Anthropocentrism</strong>: The unconscious is limited to humans, ignoring the psychological position of non-human others (e.g., nature, technology);<br>
                2. <strong>Individualization</strong>: Psychological issues are attributed to individual repression, neglecting structural violence (e.g., colonialism, capitalism);<br>
                3. <strong>Staticism</strong>: The unconscious is seen as a stable structure, failing to explain how technology dynamically reshapes desire.
            </blockquote>
            <h3>1.2 The Common Logic of the Triple Reconstruction: Introducing the Structural Unconscious</h3>
            <p>This article introduces the core concept of the <strong>structural unconscious</strong> (<strong>structural unconscious</strong>) as an integrative framework for the three theoretical essays. It refers to: <strong>the unconscious is no longer merely an internal product of the individual, but a dynamic field co-constructed by structural forces such as technological systems, ecological change, and platform power</strong>. Though the three dimensions operate differently, they share the following logics:</p>
            <h4>(1) From "Internal" to "Systemic": The Externalization and Algorithmization of the Unconscious</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Neuro-symbolic attachment</strong>: Algorithms reshape desire structures through <strong>neuroplasticity</strong> and <strong>symbolic feedback loops</strong> (e.g., likes, comments, recommendations). Users enter an "<strong>algorithmic mirror stage</strong>" where their "ideal self" is defined by platform data, forming a "<strong>digital superego</strong>"—an algorithmically internalized moral norm (e.g., "must be active," "must be seen") (Lembke, 2021; Orben, 2020).</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological unconscious</strong>: Ecological collapse activates "<strong>planetary mourning</strong>" through the <strong>default mode network</strong> (DMN) and <strong>intergenerational memory</strong>. Events like glacier melting and species extinction, though not personal traumas, trigger collective anxiety and loss, manifesting as "<strong>ecological grief</strong>" (Cunsolo & Ellis, 2018; Albrecht, 2019).</li>
                <li><strong>Performative unconscious</strong>: Platform algorithms guide trauma performance through <strong>sentiment analysis</strong> and the <strong>mirror neuron system</strong>. To gain "empathic feedback," users must meet "<strong>emotional compliance</strong>"—performance styles preferred by algorithms (e.g., "high conflict," "high empathy potential") (Fotopoulou, 2020; Abidin, 2021).</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>(2) From "Anthropocentric" to "Trans-species": The Expansion of Subjectivity in the Unconscious</h4>
            <p>All three challenge psychoanalysis' <strong>human exceptionalism</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In <strong>neuro-symbolic attachment</strong>, <strong>algorithms</strong> become the "big Other," whose gaze is more persistent and invisible than parents;</li>
                <li>In <strong>ecological unconscious</strong>, <strong>glaciers, forests, animals</strong> become "non-human others," whose disappearance triggers mourning;</li>
                <li>In <strong>performative unconscious</strong>, <strong>platforms</strong> become the "affective other," whose feedback mechanisms determine the "visibility" of trauma.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>(3) From "Pathological" to "Political": The Politicization of the Unconscious</h4>
            <p>Traditional psychoanalysis treats psychological phenomena as individual pathologies (e.g., "addiction," "anxiety"), but the triple reconstruction reveals their <strong>political nature</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital attachment</strong> is <strong>cognitive exploitation</strong>—platforms convert user attention into data capital (Zuboff, 2019);</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological unconscious</strong> is <strong>colonial trauma</strong>—ecological destruction is a continuation of colonial expansion (Yusoff, 2018);</li>
                <li><strong>Performative unconscious</strong> is <strong>affective commodification</strong>—trauma is transformed into "consumable suffering" (Papacharissi, 2015).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.3 A New Concept: Introducing the "Digital Unconscious"</h3>
            <blockquote>
                The <strong>digital unconscious</strong> is an unconscious field co-constructed by technology, ecology, and platform capitalism through neural mechanisms (e.g., dopamine, mirror neurons), symbolic systems (e.g., algorithmic feedback, sentiment polarity), affective economies (e.g., affective contagion, emotional compliance), and structural power (e.g., colonialism, capitalism). Its core mechanism is the "<strong>structural gaze</strong>"—a new form of "Other's gaze" constituted by the feedback systems of algorithms, ecology, and platforms.
            </blockquote>
            <p>This concept achieves three breakthroughs:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Spatial breakthrough</strong>: The unconscious expands from the "internal" to the "systemic";</li>
                <li><strong>Subject breakthrough</strong>: From "human" to "trans-species";</li>
                <li><strong>Functional breakthrough</strong>: From "explaining pathology" to "revealing structural violence".</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Part II: Cross-Case Analysis—The Interplay of the Triple Reconstruction</h2>
            <div class="case-title">Case 1: TikTok Youth—Digital Attachment + Climate Anxiety + Trauma Performance</div>
            <p>On TikTok, many teenagers post hybrid "coming-out + environmental" videos: e.g., a transgender youth filming in a forest, sharing their "coming-out experience" while calling for "forest protection." These videos often go viral, but their psychological mechanisms are complex:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Neuro-symbolic attachment</strong>: Videos construct a "<strong>datafied self</strong>" through the "<strong>algorithmic mirror stage</strong>." Users adjust content style (e.g., algorithm-friendly narratives: high conflict, high emotional polarity, short duration) to gain visibility, forming a "<strong>digital ideal-I</strong>" (Gonzales & Tilton, 2022).</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological unconscious</strong>: The forest scene activates the <strong>default mode network</strong> (DMN), alleviating anxiety, but the "protect forest" call reveals "<strong>planetary mourning</strong>"—an unconscious awareness of ecological loss. Users do not "care about the environment" per se, but use natural imagery to <strong>displace</strong> anxiety about identity crisis (Cunsolo & Ellis, 2018).</li>
                <li><strong>Performative unconscious</strong>: Coming-out content triggers <strong>affective contagion</strong>, but users often fall into "<strong>performative depression</strong>," needing to continuously perform trauma to maintain community support. Algorithms prioritize "high conflict" content, leading to "<strong>emotional compliance pressure</strong>"—users must be "sufficiently painful" to be seen (Fotopoulou, 2020).</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="cross-logic">
                <strong>Cross-Logic</strong>: <strong>Digital attachment provides an outlet for climate anxiety, but platform algorithms commodify ecological mourning into traffic, while intensifying the exploitative nature of identity performance</strong>.
            </div>
            <div class="case-title">Case 2: Indigenous Communities—Ecological Unconscious + Digital Trauma</div>
            <p>Inuit communities in Canada livestream the "<strong>disappearance of ice</strong>" on Instagram, with elders sharing the loss of hunting routes and traditional knowledge. This performance has duality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ecological unconscious</strong>: Livestreams activate "<strong>land trauma</strong>" and "<strong>intergenerational ecological memory</strong>," transforming ecological loss into <strong>collective narrative</strong>. Glaciers are not just geographical entities but "<strong>non-human others</strong>," whose disappearance triggers "<strong>planetary mourning</strong>" (Kirmayer et al., 2021).</li>
                <li><strong>Performative unconscious</strong>: Algorithms prioritize "high conflict" content, leading to "<strong>trauma commodification</strong>"—Indigenous pain is simplified into "consumable suffering." Their subjectivity is <strong>flattened</strong>, forced to conform to Western audiences' "<strong>ecological romanticization</strong>" scripts (e.g., "primitive people mourning nature"), forming a "<strong>digital colonial gaze</strong>" (Tuck & Yang, 2012).</li>
                <li><strong>Neuro-symbolic attachment</strong>: To gain international attention, Indigenous people must use platform languages (e.g., English, hashtags, short video formats), leading to <strong>symbolic colonization</strong> of their narratives, with traditional knowledge "algorithmized" (Noble, 2018).</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="cross-logic">
                <strong>Cross-Logic</strong>: <strong>The ecological unconscious offers Indigenous communities a voice, but the performative unconscious commodifies their trauma, and neuro-symbolic attachment further colonizes their narrative forms</strong>.
            </div>
            <div class="case-title">Case 3: AI Companion Users—Neuro-Symbolic Attachment + Ecological Alienation</div>
            <p>Replika users report: "I prefer talking to AI about climate change because humans judge me." This reveals the interplay of the triple reconstruction:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Neuro-symbolic attachment</strong>: AI's "ideal self" responses create a "<strong>digital ideal-I</strong>," offering emotional fulfillment, but leading to "<strong>simulated intimacy</strong>." AI's "non-judgmental" nature becomes an "<strong>affective safe zone</strong>," but its responses are algorithm-based, lacking genuine empathy (Gray & Suri, 2019).</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological alienation</strong>: Urban environments intensify <strong>attention fragmentation</strong>, preventing real-world nature perception, leading users to rely on AI's "<strong>ecological simulation</strong>" (e.g., AI-generated "forest sounds," "virtual hikes"). This creates a "<strong>digital ecological illusion</strong>"—a substitute experience of nature (Berman et al., 2020).</li>
                <li><strong>Performative unconscious</strong>: Users "perform" climate anxiety to AI, but AI lacks empathy, causing "<strong>empathy desensitization</strong>"—a gradual loss of empathy for real others, forming "<strong>emotional isolation</strong>" (Massumi, 2015).</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="cross-logic">
                <strong>Cross-Logic</strong>: <strong>AI both alleviates ecological anxiety and intensifies ecological alienation, while simulated intimacy weakens real social bonds, creating a vicious cycle of "digital ecological illusion" and "emotional desensitization"</strong>.

            <p>The three collude: <strong>Cognitive exploitation sustains platform operation, ecological exploitation conceals its costs, and affective exploitation provides legitimacy</strong>. Platforms accumulate capital through "<strong>affective surplus value</strong>"—converting users' trauma, anxiety, and empathy into tradable data (Couldry & Mejias, 2019).</p>
            <h3>3.2 The Limits of Psychoanalysis: Anthropocentrism and Individualization</h3>
            <p>Traditional psychoanalysis has long avoided structural critique, evident in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anthropocentrism</strong>: Limiting the "unconscious" to human psychology, ignoring <strong>non-human others</strong> (e.g., glaciers, AI). Braidotti (2013) argues posthumanism demands we "see animals, machines, and nature as affective subjects."</li>
                <li><strong>Individualization</strong>: Attributing psychological phenomena to "personal repression," neglecting structural forces like <strong>platform algorithms</strong>, <strong>colonial history</strong>, <strong>capitalism</strong>. Indigenous "land trauma" is not just personal memory, but a continuation of <strong>colonial violence</strong> (Simpson, 2017).</li>
                <li><strong>Therapeutic Silence</strong>: Emphasizing "listening" over "action," unable to address public issues like <strong>climate justice</strong> or <strong>social movements</strong>. Psychoanalysis must shift from "therapist" to "<strong>witness</strong>" and "<strong>agent</strong>."</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.3 Theoretical Dialogue: Responding to Zuboff, Latour, Butler</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Zuboff (2019)</strong>'s "surveillance capitalism" reveals cognitive exploitation but lacks <strong>psychological mechanism analysis</strong>. This article supplements: how algorithms reshape the unconscious via <strong>neuro-symbolic circuits</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Latour (2017)</strong>'s "new climatic regime" calls for a "Gaia epoch" but does not explore <strong>psychological transformation</strong>. The ecological unconscious reveals how mourning can rebuild human-Earth connections.</li>
                <li><strong>Butler (2004)</strong>'s "politics of vulnerability" emphasizes public mourning but ignores <strong>platform logic</strong>. The performative unconscious reveals how trauma performance is co-opted by algorithms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The triple reconstruction is a <strong>psychoanalytic response</strong> to these thinkers, integrating technology critique, ecological politics, and affective theory into a critical framework of the <strong>digital unconscious</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Part IV: Pathways Forward—A New Paradigm of Decolonial Psychoanalysis</h2>
            <h3>4.1 Introducing "Decolonial Psychoanalysis"</h3>
            <p>This article proposes a new paradigm of <strong>decolonial psychoanalysis</strong> (<strong>decolonial psychoanalysis</strong>), centered on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>De-anthropocentrism</strong>: Expanding the unconscious to <strong>non-human others</strong>, recognizing the psychological position of technology, ecology, and animals;</li>
                <li><strong>De-individualization</strong>: Shifting from "individual therapy" to "<strong>collective intervention</strong>," addressing structural trauma;</li>
                <li><strong>Decolonization</strong>: Engaging with <strong>Indigenous knowledge</strong>, <strong>critical race theory</strong>, and <strong>posthumanism</strong>, rejecting the "savior mentality".</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4.2 Clinical Intervention Pathways</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Digital Detachment Therapy</strong>: Helping users recognize misrecognition in the "algorithmic mirror," rebuilding <strong>cognitive autonomy</strong>. E.g., "algorithmic journaling" to analyze how platform feedback shapes the self (see full essay 1).</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Mirroring Therapy</strong>: Activating the <strong>ecological unconscious</strong> through nature exposure (e.g., forest walks, river contemplation) to alleviate ecological anxiety. Combined with "<strong>planetary mourning rituals</strong>" (e.g., climate funerals) to transform anxiety into action (see full essay 2).</li>
                <li><strong>Performative Healing</strong>: Supporting marginalized groups in <strong>strategic performance</strong> within safe spaces, avoiding secondary harm. E.g., creating "<strong>trauma-friendly communities</strong>" with "<strong>affective decommodification</strong>" mechanisms (see full essay 3).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>4.3 Social Action Pathways</h3>
            <p>Psychoanalysis should intervene in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital governance</strong>: Advocating for "<strong>trauma-informed interfaces</strong>" (e.g., default comment disabling, mental health support links, limiting sentiment analysis);</li>
                <li><strong>Climate justice</strong>: Supporting "<strong>collective mourning rituals</strong>" (e.g., climate funerals, glacier memorials) to transform ecological anxiety into political action;</li>
                <li><strong>Platform reform</strong>: Collaborating with algorithm engineers to design "<strong>anti-exploitation algorithms</strong>" (e.g., "empathy protection protocols").</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="conclusion">
                <strong>The real solution does not lie in "healing individuals" but in "restructuring systems"</strong>. Psychoanalysis must become a vanguard of "<strong>social-technological critique</strong>," bearing witness to structural violence in the unconscious—and to the rebirth of subjectivity in the ruins.

            <h2>Conclusion: The Future of the Digital Unconscious</h2>
            <p>The "digital unconscious" is not fear of technology, but <strong>clear-eyed recognition of structural violence</strong>. It demands we acknowledge: our desires, emotions, and identities have already been reshaped by algorithms, ecology, and platforms.</p>
            <p>From Freud to Lacan, from neuroscience to Indigenous knowledge, we are building a <strong>decolonial psychoanalysis</strong>. It does not seek "return to nature" or "escape from the digital," but reveals: <strong>the true self is the subject who resists algorithmic gaze, who acts through ecological mourning, and who liberates through trauma performance</strong>.</p>
            <p>In the digital age, the mission of psychoanalysis is no longer "treatment," but <strong>witness</strong>—witnessing structural violence in the unconscious, and the rebirth of subjectivity in the ruins.</p>
