            <h2>Challenges and Innovations in CAPM's Multi-domain Applications</h2>
            <p>The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), as a cornerstone of modern financial theory, has long played a significant role in asset pricing and risk management. However, as financial markets continue to evolve and become more complex, CAPM's application in various fields faces new challenges. This article explores the limitations of CAPM from the perspectives of climate finance, cryptocurrency markets, and behavioral finance, and proposes innovative directions for improvement.</p>

            <h3>Application and Limitations of CAPM in Climate Finance</h3>
            <p><strong>Integrating Climate Risk with Beta Coefficients</strong></p>
            <p>Global climate change issues are becoming increasingly severe, making climate finance a focal point for investors. CAPM measures the market risk exposure of an asset through the beta coefficient, with its basic formula being:</p>
            <p>\[ E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f) \]</p>
            <p>In climate finance, the impact of climate risk on asset returns cannot be overlooked. Climate risks are divided into physical risks and transition risks, both of which are difficult to fully capture using traditional CAPM models. Therefore, the following improvements can be considered:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Climate-adjusted Beta Coefficient</strong>: Introduce a climate risk factor on top of the traditional beta coefficient to form a "climate-adjusted beta coefficient":</li>
                <p>\[ \beta_i^{climate} = \beta_i + \alpha_i \cdot CR_i \]</p>
                <li><strong>Climate Risk Premium</strong>: Add a climate risk premium term to the CAPM formula:</li>
                <p>\[ E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f) + \lambda_i \]</p>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Limitations: Challenges of Non-financial Risks</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Non-market Nature of Climate Risk</strong>: Climate risks cannot be fully reflected through market prices, making them difficult to measure using traditional market data.</li>
                <li><strong>Multidimensional Risk Factors</strong>: Climate risks involve physical, social, and political dimensions, which CAPM struggles to fully reflect.</li>
                <li><strong>Heterogeneity in Investor Behavior</strong>: Differences in investors' perceptions and responses to climate risks significantly impact CAPM's predictive ability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Applicability of CAPM in Cryptocurrency Markets</h3>
            <p><strong>Volatility and CAPM's Applicability</strong></p>
            <p>The extreme volatility of cryptocurrency markets poses significant challenges to CAPM:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Impact of High Volatility on Beta Coefficient</strong>: The instability of cryptocurrency markets makes the calculation of beta coefficients complex and unreliable.</li>
                <li><strong>Volatility of Market Risk Premium</strong>: The剧烈波动 in cryptocurrency markets leads to significant fluctuations in market risk premiums.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Challenges of Historical Data to CAPM</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Insufficient Data Time Span</strong>: Most cryptocurrencies have a short historical data time span, making it difficult to reliably apply CAPM.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Quality Issues</strong>: Market opacity and the diversity of trading platforms lead to data quality issues.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Uniqueness of Market Structure and CAPM's Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Correlation Between Cryptocurrencies</strong>: The correlation of cryptocurrency assets significantly changes over time, which CAPM struggles to capture.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Liquidity Differences</strong>: Significant differences in market liquidity in cryptocurrency markets impact the applicability of CAPM.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Do We Need to Adjust CAPM or Develop New Models?</strong></p>
            <p>Given these challenges, the applicability of CAPM in cryptocurrency markets is limited. Possible improvements include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Adjusting the CAPM Model</strong>: Introduce more complex volatility models and behavioral finance concepts to improve CAPM.</li>
                <li><strong>Developing New Pricing Models</strong>: Design new pricing models based on blockchain technology and market liquidity factors.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Role of CAPM in Behavioral Finance</h3>
            <p><strong>Impact of Behavioral Biases on CAPM's Effectiveness</strong></p>
            <p>Behavioral finance reveals the impact of investors' irrational behaviors on markets:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overconfidence</strong>: Investors overestimate their judgment abilities, leading to market volatility greater than CAPM predicts.</li>
                <li><strong>Herd Behavior</strong>: Investors follow the crowd, causing market prices to deviate from intrinsic value.</li>
                <li><strong>Loss Aversion</strong>: Investors are more sensitive to losses than gains, affecting the rational trade-off between risk and return.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Model Improvements Combining Behavioral Finance</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Introducing Sentiment Indicators</strong>: Capture market sentiment changes through sentiment indicators to improve predictive ability.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Factor Models</strong>: Introduce behavioral factors such as overconfidence, herd behavior, and loss aversion to improve CAPM.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Adjustment of Model Parameters</strong>: Dynamically adjust CAPM parameters based on market sentiment and behavioral biases to enhance applicability and predictive ability.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>CAPM has achieved significant success in traditional financial markets but faces challenges in emerging fields such as climate finance, cryptocurrency markets, and behavioral finance. By introducing climate risk factors, adjusting volatility models, incorporating sentiment indicators and behavioral factors, and dynamically adjusting model parameters, CAPM can be improved to more accurately reflect market realities. Future research should further explore the application and effectiveness of these improvement methods, advancing the theoretical development and practical application of asset pricing models.</p>
