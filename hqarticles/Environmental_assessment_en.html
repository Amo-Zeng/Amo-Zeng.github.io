            <h2>Introduction: The Expanding Judiciary</h2>
            <p>In 2017, New Zealand's Whanganui River was declared an "indivisible living entity" in court and granted two legal representatives. In 2021, India's Supreme Court directly recognized the Ganges as a "living judicial entity." These cases subvert the foundational logic of traditional environmental assessmentâ€”when assessment subjects evolve into legal entities, the centuries-old anthropocentric stance of environmental impact assessments faces fundamental ethical challenges.

            <h2>Theoretical Reconstruction: Dissolving Species Boundaries in Cognition</h2>
            <p>Donna Haraway's <em>Cyborg Manifesto</em> deconstructed the binary narrative of organisms and machines, while Bruno Latour's Actor-Network Theory (ANT) reveals how humans, salmon, hydropower plants, and sedimentary rocks form an interconnected web of actants. <em>(Theoretical source: Latour's <em>Politics of Nature</em>, 2013)</em></p>
            
            <h3>New Understandings of Material Expression</h3>
            <p>When Arctic glaciers undergo structural collapse due to surpassing temperature thresholds, their "interests" manifest materially through hydrological shifts and species migration. French philosopher Jean-Luc Marion's concept of "givenness" illustrates how trout express their existential will through reduced spawning rates when migration routes are blocked.</p>

                <li><strong>MSG Matrix:</strong> Incorporating 30 indicators including forest carbon sequestration efficiency and microbial diversity retention.</li>
                <li><strong>Tripartite Framework:</strong> Indigenous communities (bearers of traditional wisdom), AI hydrological models (algorithmic representatives), and bioacoustic sensors (material witnesses).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In Peru's Andean mining project evaluation, the MSG model prevented the extinction of 98 lichen species. <em>(Case source: Ecuador's <em>2008 Constitution</em> Natural Rights Clause)</em></p>

            <h2>Implementation Pathways: From Rights Declaration to Embodied Resistance</h2>
            <p>During the Yangtze River ecological restoration dispute, AI simulations of 200,000 Chinese sturgeon migration patterns led courts to halt dam construction. Ecuador's Constitutional Court applied a "Natural Integrity Damage Coefficient" in 2021, ruling that mining activities disrupted moss ecological memory. <em>(Data source: Lomas Case Verdict EC-CC-001-21)</em></p>

            <h2>Challenges and Tensions: Measuring the Immeasurable</h2>
            <p>Germany's "Secondary Perception Metrics" attempt to model ecological suffering, while China's panda reserve wind farm project exposes dilemmas in adjudicating heterogeneous rights. Yellowstone National Park cases warn against ecological populism. <em>(Theoretical basis: Morton's <em>Nature as Other</em>, 2019)</em></p>

            <h2>Vision: Toward Ecological Constitutionalism</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Establish Ecological Rights Review Committees</li>
                <li>Implement blockchain environmental ledgers for automated remediation</li>
                <li>Deploy AI ecological advocates to interpret coral bleaching data</li>

            <h2>Conclusion: Reframing Assessment's Ultimate Question</h2>
            <p>When the core issue shifts from "is development sustainable" to "which species has the right to define sustainability," this transformation becomes humanity's ultimate reflection on its own existential paradigm.</p>
