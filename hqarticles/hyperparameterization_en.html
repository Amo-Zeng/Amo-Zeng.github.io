            <h2>Redefining the New Paradigm of Hyperparameter Optimization</h2>
            <p>In the field of machine learning, hyperparameters play a crucial role in determining the model structure and learning process. However, traditional hyperparameter optimization methods often show low efficiency when faced with high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged: treating hyperparameters as learnable variables, allowing the model to dynamically adjust hyperparameters during training.</p>

            <h3>Diversity and Complexity of Hyperparameters</h3>
            <p>Hyperparameters are diverse, covering various aspects from the choice of optimization algorithms to the definition of network structures. Interactions between different hyperparameters make the tuning process highly complex.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Nonlinear Relationship Between Hyperparameters and Model Performance</h3>
            <p>The relationship between hyperparameters and model performance is usually nonlinear. A slight change in a hyperparameter can lead to significant fluctuations in model performance, making hyperparameter optimization even more complex.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization Methods</h3>
            <p>In recent years, more efficient hyperparameter optimization methods have gradually gained prominence, such as Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms, and automated machine learning (AutoML).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bayesian Optimization</strong>: A global optimization method based on probabilistic models, suitable for high-dimensional, non-convex, and noisy optimization problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Evolutionary Algorithms</strong>: Simulating the process of biological evolution, with strong global search capabilities and parallelism.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)</strong>: Simplifying the process of model selection and hyperparameter optimization through automation techniques.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Practical Considerations</h3>
            <p>In practical applications, the efficiency and practicality of hyperparameter optimization are not only reflected in the choice of optimization methods but also involve constraints on computational resources, user experience, and the interpretability of results.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Redefining hyperparameters is not just a technological innovation but also a deep thinking about the essence of machine learning. It challenges traditional model design concepts and drives machine learning towards a more intelligent and adaptive direction.</p>
