            <h2>New Ideas and Directions for Adult Education Policy: From "Digital Divide" to "Value Realization"</h2>
            <p>In today's rapidly digitalizing world, adult education faces unprecedented challenges and opportunities. The rapid development and widespread application of digital technology have not only profoundly changed people's lifestyles but also posed new demands on the philosophy, models, and objectives of adult education. The widening digital divide has become a significant factor constraining social equity and economic development. The traditional single-supply model can no longer meet the increasingly diverse needs of learners in the new era. Adult education urgently needs to shift from "competency enhancement" to "value realization" to better support personal career development and social mobility. Facing these challenges, adult education policies need to keep pace with the times, innovate and optimize across multiple dimensions, explore new ideas and directions, and promote high-quality development in adult education.</p>

            <h3>I. From "Digital Divide" to "Digital Empowerment": Bridging the Digital Skill Gap</h3>
            <p>The digital divide is not only reflected in the disparities in digital devices and network access between different regions and populations but also in the significant differences in digital skills and digital literacy. How to effectively bridge the digital skill gap and transform the digital divide into digital empowerment has become an important issue for adult education policy.</p>
            <h4>1. Manifestations and Challenges of the Digital Divide</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Age Differences</strong>: Older populations often lack understanding and trust in digital technology and struggle to master basic digital skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Regional Differences</strong>: Adult populations in remote and rural areas lack access to digital devices and networks, making it difficult for them to benefit from the conveniences of digital technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Occupational Differences</strong>: The digital skill gap between low-skilled and high-skilled workers is widening, affecting their career development and income levels.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Objectives and Implementation Pathways for Digital Empowerment</h4>
            <p>The goal of digital empowerment is to enhance the digital literacy and skill levels of adult populations, enabling them to use digital technology safely and effectively, thereby promoting career development and social mobility. To this end, adult education policies need to implement the following measures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diversified Learning Methods</strong>: Utilize online learning platforms, mobile learning applications, and social media to provide flexible and convenient digital skill learning pathways.</li>
                <li><strong>Industry-Education Collaboration</strong>: Encourage businesses to participate in digital skill training, develop practical training courses aligned with actual needs, and link them to business recruitment demands.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Education</strong>: Establish digital skill learning centers in communities, providing face-to-face guidance and assistance, especially for the elderly and low-income populations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Expected Outcomes</h4>
            <p>By bridging the digital skill gap, adult education policies can effectively enhance digital literacy and skill levels, promote digital economic development and social equity, and provide talent support for building a Digital China.</p>

            <h3>II. From "Single Supply" to "Multi-Stakeholder Participation": Building an Open and Inclusive Adult Education Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>Traditional adult education primarily relies on government-led single-supply models, which struggle with limited resources, single content, and lack of flexibility, making them unable to meet the diverse needs of learners in the new era. Therefore, building an open and inclusive adult education ecosystem involving multiple stakeholders—government, businesses, social organizations, and individuals—has become essential for driving adult education reform and building a learning society.</p>
            <h4>1. Challenges of Traditional Single-Supply Models</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Insufficient Resource Provision</strong>: Limited government funding makes it difficult to cover all areas of adult education and meet the diverse needs of adult learners across different ages, professions, and learning goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Single Educational Content</strong>: Traditional adult education focuses mainly on exam preparation and vocational skill training, lacking attention to emerging fields, interdisciplinary knowledge, and comprehensive literacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Rigid Learning Methods</strong>: Traditional adult education mostly involves offline, concentrated lectures, making it difficult to balance learners' career development and family life needs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Necessity and Pathways of a Multi-Stakeholder Ecosystem</h4>
            <p>Building a multi-stakeholder adult education ecosystem can stimulate market vitality, promote cross-sector collaboration, and innovate service models, improving learning experiences and efficiency. To achieve this, policies need to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Policy Guidance</strong>: Develop policies encouraging multi-stakeholder participation in adult education, create collaboration platforms, and facilitate resource sharing and information exchange.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Driven</strong>: Encourage businesses and social organizations to participate in adult education, develop high-quality online educational resources, and provide personalized, intelligent learning services.</li>
                <li><strong>Mechanism Assurance</strong>: Establish quality evaluation systems to ensure educational quality; increase investment in education in rural and economically underdeveloped areas to promote educational equity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Expected Outcomes</h4>
            <p>By building an open and inclusive adult education ecosystem, educational resources will become more abundant, educational content more high-quality, learning experiences more user-friendly, and social development more inclusive, providing strong momentum for building a learning society.</p>

            <h3>III. From "Competency Enhancement" to "Value Realization": Supporting Personal Career Development and Social Mobility</h3>
            <p>The ultimate goal of adult education is not only to enhance learners' knowledge and skills but also to achieve "value realization," meaning empowering adult learners to gain recognition in their careers and find their place in social mobility, ultimately achieving the unity of personal and social values.</p>
            <h4>1. Deepening Adult Education Objectives</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>From "Competency Enhancement" to "Value Realization"</strong>: Adult education should not only focus on knowledge transfer and skill training but also help learners find career directions and pathways to realize their personal values.</li>
                <li><strong>Career Development and Social Mobility</strong>: Adult education policies need to organically combine learners' personal needs with social needs, driving individual growth and social progress.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Policy Pathways to Support Career Development and Social Mobility</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Industry-Education Integration</strong>: Deeply collaborate with businesses to design practical and forward-looking curriculum systems, establish talent supply-demand connection mechanisms, and improve the alignment between education and employment.</li>
                <li><strong>Career Guidance</strong>: Provide career assessments, job information dissemination, and career planning consultations to help learners clarify career directions.</li>
                <li><strong>Incentive Mechanisms</strong>: Offer learning subsidies, scholarships, and professional certification to reduce learners' economic burdens and motivate lifelong learning.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Promoting Social Equity and Inclusion</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bridging the "Knowledge Gap"</strong>: By providing equal educational opportunities for learners from different backgrounds, adult education policies can narrow the "knowledge gap" and promote social equity.</li>
                <li><strong>Building Multiple Upward Pathways</strong>: Promote vocational qualification certification and skill level evaluation, providing learners with diversified career development paths.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>4. Future Directions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Learner-Centered</strong>: Policy design should focus on the needs of adult learners, offering flexible learning methods and personalized services.</li>
                <li><strong>Data-Driven Decision-Making</strong>: Utilize big data technology to optimize curriculum design and resource allocation.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Social Recognition</strong>: By promoting the value of adult education, improve societal recognition of adult learners.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>IV. Conclusion</h3>
            <p>From "Digital Divide" to "Digital Empowerment," from "Single Supply" to "Multi-Stakeholder Participation," and from "Competency Enhancement" to "Value Realization," adult education policies need to keep pace with the times, actively respond to the challenges of the digital era, and promote high-quality development in adult education. By leveraging diversified learning methods, industry-education collaboration, and community education, we can bridge the digital skill gap and transform the digital divide into digital empowerment. By innovating policy frameworks, building collaboration platforms, and developing online education, we can construct an open and inclusive adult education ecosystem, stimulate educational vitality, and meet diverse learning needs. Through industry-education integration, career guidance, and incentive mechanisms, we can support personal career development and social mobility, promoting social equity and justice. In the future, adult education should continue to center on learners, continuously innovate policies, optimize services, and provide stronger support for the realization of personal and social values.</p>
