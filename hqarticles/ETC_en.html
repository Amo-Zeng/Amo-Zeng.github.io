Webpage Translation Request

It seems you've shared a complete HTML webpage structure and are asking for a translation. However, the content shown appears to be a technical article about AI and data privacy that already contains both Chinese and English elements.

For a proper translation of your webpage, I can help with:

1. Translating the Chinese content to English while maintaining the HTML structure
2. Creating a fully English version of the page
3. Implementing a bilingual website structure with proper language switching functionality

Could you please clarify exactly what you need:
- Are you asking to translate this specific page from Chinese to English?
- Or do you want help building a bilingual website with both Chinese and English versions?
- Do you need implementation of the language switching button functionality?

Please specify your exact requirements so I can provide the most appropriate translation and implementation solution.
