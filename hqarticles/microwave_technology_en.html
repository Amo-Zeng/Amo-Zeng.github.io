            <ul>
                <li><strong>Penetration:</strong> Microwaves can penetrate cloud cover, smoke, and vegetation, providing observation data unaffected by weather conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Weather Independence:</strong> Unlike optical and infrared remote sensing, microwave remote sensing can perform continuous monitoring under any weather conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Application Examples:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Atmospheric Monitoring:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Microwave remote sensing satellites like NASA's OCO-2 and ESA's Sentinel-5P use the absorption and scattering properties of microwaves to accurately measure global greenhouse gas concentrations, providing crucial data support for climate change research.</li>
                        <li>Microwave radiometers are used to monitor atmospheric temperature and humidity, supporting weather forecasting and extreme weather alerts, enhancing the accuracy and timeliness of predictions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Soil Monitoring:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ESA's SMOS satellite measures soil moisture through microwave technology, supporting irrigation, drought monitoring, and water resource management, enhancing agricultural productivity and environmental conservation.</li>
                        <li>Microwave signals can also assess forest cover and vegetation health, providing scientific grounds for ecological protection and restoration.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
