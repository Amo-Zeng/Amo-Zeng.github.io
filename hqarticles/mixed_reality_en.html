            <h3>The Boundaries of Virtual and Reality: From the "Fourth Wall" to "Limitless Possibilities"</h3>
            <p>The "Fourth Wall" was once an invisible barrier in theatrical art, separating the stage from the audience, maintaining the tradition and rules of performance. However, the advent of mixed reality technology is like a sharp hammer that smashes this wall, opening a new era of seamless fusion between virtual and reality.</p>
            <p>Mixed reality technology breaks traditional physical limitations, blurring the boundaries between virtual and reality and bringing unprecedented creative freedom to artistic creation. Artists can freely unleash their creativity in virtual spaces, unconstrained by physical materials, creating dreamlike visual effects.</p>

            <h3>The Intertwining of Emotion and Technology: Building a Bridge Between Virtual and Real Hearts</h3>
            <p>Under the impetus of mixed reality technology, the virtual world is gradually transforming from cold code into a place filled with warmth and emotion. The integration of Affective Computing technology provides a crucial catalyst for this transformation. Affective Computing enables machines to understand and recognize human emotions.</p>
            <p>The application of Affective Computing in mixed reality allows virtual characters to interact with users more authentically, enhancing emotional resonance in the virtual world. This emotional transmission and interaction make the virtual world no longer just cold code but filled with human warmth.</p>

            <h3>The Fusion of Space and Computing: Opening a New Era of Collaboration and Creation</h3>
            <p>The fusion of mixed reality technology with spatial computing (Spatial Computing) is opening unique new modes of collaboration and creation. Spatial computing transforms spatial information in the real world into computable data, analyzing, processing, and visualizing it, giving computers the ability to understand and process physical spaces.</p>
            <p>The combination of mixed reality and spatial computing brings new possibilities for collaboration and creation. In the field of collaboration, mixed reality technology breaks geographical limitations, making remote collaboration more efficient and immersive.</p>
