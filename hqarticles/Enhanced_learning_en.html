            <h2>From "Data-Driven" to "Causality-Driven"</h2>
            <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL), as a learning method based on reward mechanism, has demonstrated strong potential in multiple fields. However, traditional RL methods primarily rely on extensive data for training. Although this "data-driven" approach performs well in many scenarios, it often struggles when faced with scarce data or complex, ever-changing environments. Therefore, achieving the goal of "small data, big tasks" by reducing reliance on data has become an important direction in RL research.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Limitations of Data-Driven Approaches</h3>
            <p>Traditional RL methods heavily depend on large amounts of data for training. By continuously interacting with the environment, the agent learns the optimal strategy. This "data-driven" approach excels in many scenarios, such as game play and robot control, but it also has significant limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strong Data Dependency:</strong> RL requires extensive data for training. In cases of data scarcity, the learning outcomes are often unsatisfactory.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Generalization:</strong> Traditional RL methods typically perform well in specific environments but struggle to transfer learned strategies to new environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Poor Interpretability:</strong> Since RL relies heavily on data-driven approaches, its decision-making process often lacks interpretability, making it difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Introduction of Causal Inference</h3>
            <p>To overcome the limitations of traditional RL methods, researchers have begun to introduce causal inference. Causal inference is a method based on causal relationships that helps better understand and predict system behavior. The incorporation of causal inference in RL is reflected in the following aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Causal Graph Models:</strong> Causal graph models are graphical representations of causal relationships. With causal graph models, it becomes easier to understand the causal relationships among various variables in the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Counterfactual Reasoning:</strong> Counterfactual reasoning is a hypothetical reasoning method that analyzes the impact of changes in certain conditions on outcomes. This approach helps RL systems better adapt to environmental changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Causal Reinforcement Learning (CRL):</strong> Causal RL integrates causal inference into RL by incorporating causal relationships into the objective function, value function, and policy update process, enhancing the system's interpretability, generalization, and robustness.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Causality-Driven Reinforcement Learning</h3>
            <p>The introduction of causal inference has led RL to shift from "data-driven" to "causality-driven." Causality-driven RL methods demonstrate significant advantages in several aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduced Data Dependency:</strong> Through causal inference, existing data can be better utilized, reducing reliance on large datasets and achieving the goal of "small data, big tasks."</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Generalization:</strong> Causality-driven RL methods can better understand causal relationships within the system, thereby improving the generalization of strategies and adaptability to different environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Interpretability:</strong> Causal inference helps us better understand the decision-making process of RL systems, enhancing their interpretability and credibility.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Case Studies</h3>
            <h4>Case 1: Causality-Driven RL in Robotic Control</h4>
            <p>In robotic control, traditional RL methods typically require extensive data for training to enable robots to master complex tasks. However, by introducing causal inference, data dependency can be significantly reduced. For example, by constructing causal graph models to analyze the causal relationships between robotic joint movements and task completion, it becomes possible to more effectively guide robotic action selection, thereby enabling efficient learning even with scarce data.</p>
            <h4>Case 2: Causal RL in Medical Decision-Making</h4>
            <p>In the medical field, doctors need to make decisions based on patient conditions and treatment options. Traditional data-driven methods may require extensive historical case data to train an effective decision-making model. With causality-driven approaches, causal inference can be used to analyze the causal impact of different treatment options on patient recovery, thereby enabling more scientific and effective treatment plans even with limited data.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Future Outlook</h3>
            <p>The convergence of RL and causal inference offers new directions and insights for the development of RL. In the future, as causal inference is increasingly applied in RL, RL is expected to play a significant role in more fields, driving further advancements in AI technology.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cross-Domain Applications:</strong> Causality-driven RL methods will be applied in more fields such as finance, transportation, and education, promoting the intelligent development of various industries.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration of Theory and Practice:</strong> Future research will focus more on the theoretical integration of causal inference and RL, exploring more efficient and robust learning algorithms.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Interpretability and Transparency:</strong> With the introduction of causal inference, the interpretability and transparency of RL systems will improve, making them more reliable and trustworthy in practical applications.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>By incorporating causal inference into RL, we can not only overcome the limitations of traditional RL methods but also enhance the interpretability, generalization, and robustness of RL systems. In the future, causality-driven RL methods will be applied in broader fields, driving continuous progress in AI technology.</p>
