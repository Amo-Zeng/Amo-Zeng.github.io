You mentioned "æ•°ç”²" (Shu Jia), which may have the following common meanings. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

### 1. **Gaokao Math Exam Classification**
In some provinces in China (e.g., Yunnan, Sichuan, etc.), the Gaokao math exam is divided into **Jia volume (National Volume III)** and Yi volume (National Volume I/II):
- **Applicable regions**: Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangxi, Tibet, etc. (National Volume III regions).
- **Features**: Compared to the National Yi volume, the Shu Jia volume is moderately difficult and covers core high school math topics such as algebra, geometry, probability, and statistics.
- **Expansion**: The national volumes are classified as:
  - **Yi volume (National Volume I/II)**: High-population provinces like Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi (more challenging).
  - **Jia volume (National Volume III)**: Southwestern and northwestern regions.
  - **New Gaokao Volume I/II**: Reform provinces like Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang.

### 2. **Japanese University Entrance Exam Math Classification**
In Japanâ€™s National Center Test (å…±é€šãƒ†ã‚¹ãƒˆ), "Math Jia" refers to **humanities math (Mathematics â… A)**:
- **Content**: Number theory, probability, statistics, basic algebra/geometry (for humanities candidates).
- **Science math**: Called "Math Yi (Mathematics â…¡B+C)," includes advanced topics like calculus and vectors.
