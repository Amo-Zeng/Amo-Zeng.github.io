            <h3>1. Green Theater Management: Dual Responsibility to the Environment and Society</h3>
            <h4>1.1 Necessity of Green Theater Management</h4>
            <p>With the intensification of global climate change, reducing carbon emissions and conserving resources has become a global consensus. Theaters, as high-energy-consuming public places, are increasingly drawing attention to the energy consumption and waste management issues arising from their operations. Implementing green management not only helps reduce negative environmental impacts but also enhances the theater's social image, attracting more audiences who are concerned about sustainability.</p>
