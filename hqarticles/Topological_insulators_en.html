            <h3>1. Revolutionary Applications of Topological Insulators in Quantum Computing</h3>
            <p>The core challenges of quantum computing lie in the stability of quantum bits (qubits) and precise control of quantum states. Topological insulators, with their topologically protected boundary states, represent a potential breakthrough in addressing these issues.</p>
            <h4>1.1 Stability of Quantum Bits</h4>
            <p>Traditional qubits are highly sensitive to environmental noise and material defects, leading to quantum state decoherence. On the other hand, the boundary states of topological insulators exhibit non-localization characteristics, remaining stable even in the presence of disorder and impurities.</p>
            <h4>1.2 Topological Quantum Computing</h4>
            <p>Topological quantum computing leverages topological invariants to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation. Majorana fermions in topological insulators are considered key to realizing this goal.</p>
            <h4>1.3 Quantum Entanglement and Quantum Communication</h4>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is fundamental to quantum communication, and the boundary states of topological insulators provide new avenues for stable transmission of quantum entanglement.</p>
