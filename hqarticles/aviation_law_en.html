            <h2>Challenges of Airspace in the Digital Age</h2>
            <p>In the wave of digitalization, humanity's development and utilization of airspace are undergoing profound changes. Drone swarms shuttle through low altitudes, flying cars glide between city skyscrapers, and supersonic passenger jets race through the stratosphere. The traffic in the skies is growing at an unprecedented pace. In this future scenario, the sky is no longer a vague free space but is gradually evolving into a sophisticated and complex “sky city.”</p>

            <h3>Challenges of Airspace in the Digital Age</h3>
            <p>Traditional aviation law is built on the foundation of manned aircraft, with the core objectives of ensuring flight safety, air traffic order, and civil aviation rights. However, with the普及 of drones, the exponential growth of aviation data, and the increasing threats of cyber attacks, the current legal framework is struggling to cope with these emerging challenges.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complexity of Airspace Management:</strong> The proliferation of drones has brought challenges to airspace management. How to allocate airspace resources reasonably while ensuring safety has become a top priority.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Privacy and Security Dilemma:</strong> The vast amount of passenger data held by airlines and the increasing entanglement with third-party data make balancing data utilization and privacy protection尤为 urgent.</li>
                <li><strong>New Battleground for Cybersecurity:</strong> Aviation networks have become critical national infrastructure, and building robust cybersecurity defenses is more pressing than ever.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Interplay of International Aviation Law and Geopolitics</h3>
            <p>The sky has always been a distant dream and a source of exploration for humanity. However, in modern society, this vast sky has become a new battlefield for national competition. The interplay of international aviation law and geopolitics means that beneath the seemingly calm blue skies and white clouds, fierce interest disputes and power struggles are hidden.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Airspace Disputes: A New Battleground for Geopolitics</strong>

            <h3>Aviation Law and the Construction of a Community with a Shared Future for Humankind</h3>
            <p>In the wave of globalization, the destinies of nations are intertwined. From the aircraft soaring in the sky to disaster scenes shaking the ground, the aviation industry, with its unique speed and connectivity, has become a microcosm of the closely linked fates of countries. However, along with the development of the aviation industry, there are also global challenges such as climate change, public health crises, and natural disasters. In this context, aviation law should no longer be merely a sectoral law regulating aviation activities but should become the legal cornerstone for building a community with a shared future for humankind.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soaring with the Wings of Law: Aviation Law's Green Mission in Addressing Climate Change</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has formulated the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality in the aviation industry through carbon reduction and offset mechanisms.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Protecting with the Wings of Law: The Crucial Role of Aviation Law in Global Public Health Cooperation</strong>

            <h3>Conclusion: Building an Aviation Legal System Adaptable to the Digital Age</h3>
            <p>Aviation law in the digital age is not just a set of rules but also the infrastructure that maintains the operation of “The Sky City.” It must address the challenges brought by new technologies while providing institutional guarantees for the optimal allocation of airspace resources. In this reconstruction of aviation law, we need to adhere to principles of technological neutrality, safety priority, and sustainable development to ensure that digital transformation can unlock the potential of airspace while safeguarding the public interest.</p>
