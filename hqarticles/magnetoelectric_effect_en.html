            <h2>History and Basics of the Magnetoelectric Effect</h2>
            <p>The magnetoelectric effect, a cornerstone concept in the field of electromagnetism, has been a focal point of scientific exploration and technological innovation since the early 19th century. Its history traces back to Hans Christian Oersted's groundbreaking experiment, which revealed that electric currents induce magnetic fields and laid the foundation for electromagnetism. Subsequently, André-Marie Ampère's Ampère's Law accurately quantified the connection between currents and magnetic fields, while Michael Faraday's electromagnetic induction paved the way for the development of generators and transformers. James Clerk Maxwell's Maxwell's Equations finally synthesized these discoveries into a unified mathematical framework for modern electromagnetism, making it a luminous gem in physics.</p>
