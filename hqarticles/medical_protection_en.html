            <h2>From "Curing Diseases" to "Holistic Health": Building a Comprehensive Smart Healthcare Security System</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of social economy and significant improvement in people's living standards, the traditional healthcare security system can no longer meet the growing health needs of the populace. From "curing diseases" to "preventing diseases," and then to "holistic health," the transformation of the healthcare security system is profoundly impacting the overall health level of the population. This transformation is not only a necessary choice to address the rapid rise in healthcare costs but also a crucial pathway to achieving the Healthy China strategy and enhancing the overall health quality of the nation. At the same time, the increasingly prominent psychological health issues in modern society make the construction of a comprehensive and balanced healthcare security system, especially the deepening and innovation in the field of mental health, an urgent task to be addressed.</p>

            <h3>I. Development Direction of Healthcare Security System</h3>
            <h4>1.1 From "Passive Reimbursement" to "Proactive Health"</h4>
            <p>The traditional healthcare security system is centered on "curing diseases," mainly compensating for the costs of disease treatment, which is a "passive reimbursement" model. However, the future healthcare security system should place greater emphasis on "preventing diseases," i.e., reducing the incidence of diseases through preventive and health management measures, enhancing the overall health literacy of the population, and promoting the transition from "passive reimbursement" to "proactive health." This shift can effectively alleviate healthcare burdens and improve the overall health level of the nation.</p>
            <h4>1.2 From "Single Payment" to "Multiple Co-insurance"</h4>
            <p>The future healthcare security system will gradually break away from the single government payment model, constructing a co-insurance mechanism involving government, society, and individuals. The government bears the basic responsibility of providing essential healthcare security; social forces offer supplementary security and diversified health services; and individuals need to enhance their health awareness and actively participate in health management. This diversified payment mechanism will effectively improve the coverage and sustainability of healthcare security.</p>
            <h4>1.3 From "Extensive Management" to "Precision Services"</h4>
            <p>The traditional healthcare security management approach is relatively extensive and fails to meet personalized and differentiated health needs. The future healthcare security system will leverage big data and artificial intelligence technologies to create precise profiles of参保人员, offering personalized health management services, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of security measures and driving the transformation of healthcare security from "broad coverage" to "high quality."</p>
            <h4>1.4 From Physiological Health to Holistic Health</h4>
            <p>The modern healthcare security system should shift from single physiological disease treatment to a comprehensive holistic health management model. This includes not only the prevention and treatment of physiological diseases but also the identification, intervention, and rehabilitation of psychological disorders. The holistic health concept will help improve the overall health level of the population and reduce the disease burden caused by psychological health issues.</p>

            <h3>II. Innovation Points of the Healthcare Security System</h3>
            <h4>2.1 Building a "Prevention-Oriented" Healthcare Payment System</h4>
            <p>Incorporating "preventing diseases" services such as disease prevention and health management into the scope of healthcare payments, exploring multiple payment methods such as capitation, diagnosis-related groups (DRG), and performance-based payments, to incentivize healthcare institutions and professionals to actively participate in "preventing diseases" services, reducing the incidence of diseases at the source and enhancing the efficiency of healthcare funds.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Developing "Internet+ Healthcare" Services</h4>
            <p>Leveraging the internet, big data, and artificial intelligence technologies to integrate online and offline medical resources, offering convenient, efficient, and high-quality services such as online consultations, chronic disease management, and health monitoring to参保人员, creating a new model of "internet+ healthcare." This model can not only improve the accessibility of healthcare services but also alleviate the issue of uneven distribution of medical resources.</p>
            <h4>2.3 Establishing a Comprehensive "Health Education" System</h4>
            <p>Integrating health education into the national education system, using various channels and forms to disseminate health knowledge, advocate for healthy lifestyles, and enhance the overall health literacy of the population, thereby preventing and controlling the occurrence of diseases at the source. The popularization of health education will help raise the health awareness of the populace and reduce unnecessary medical expenditures.</p>
            <h4>2.4 Breaking "Information Silos" and Building a National Health Information Platform</h4>
            <p>Unifying data standards, promoting the interconnection and sharing of data among various stakeholders such as healthcare institutions, healthcare insurance, commercial insurance, and pharmaceutical companies, enabling the sharing and exchange of electronic medical records, health archives, and healthcare settlement information. Establishing a multi-level national health information platform at the national, provincial, and municipal levels, aggregating health data throughout an individual's life cycle, providing data support for precision medicine and personalized services, and driving the intelligent development of the healthcare security system.</p>
            <h4>2.5 Focusing on Mental Health and Establishing Special Funds and Insurance Products</h4>
            <p>Establishing a dedicated mental health fund for mental health education and prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of mental disorders, as well as research and innovation in mental health services. At the same time, developing mental health insurance products covering expenses such as psychological counseling, psychotherapy, and medication, reducing the economic burden on individuals and families, and improving the accessibility and coverage of mental health services.</p>

            <h3>III. Implementation Recommendations</h3>
            <h4>3.1 Strengthening Top-Level Design</h4>
            <p>Formulating relevant policies and regulations to clarify the status and role of "preventing diseases" and mental health in the healthcare security system, improving supporting measures, and providing institutional guarantees for the development of "preventing diseases" and mental health services, ensuring the continuity and stability of policies.</p>
            <h4>3.2 Increasing Financial Investment</h4>
            <p>Increasing financial investment in "preventing diseases" and mental health services, establishing special funds for supporting the construction of the "preventing diseases" and mental health service systems, talent training, technological innovation, etc., ensuring the sustainability and high-quality advancement of services.</p>
            <h4>3.3 Encouraging Social Participation</h4>
            <p>Encouraging social capital to enter the fields of "preventing diseases" and mental health services, exploring diversified investment and financing models, providing financial support for the development of "preventing diseases" and mental health services, and promoting a favorable pattern of government-led and social participation.</p>
            <h4>3.4 Strengthening Supervision and Management</h4>
            <p>Establishing a comprehensive supervision and management mechanism for "preventing diseases" and mental health services, strengthening the qualification review of service providers...</p>
