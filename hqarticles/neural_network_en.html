            <h2>Interaction between Neural Networks and Human Intelligence: From Biology to Cultural Dissemination and Environmental Interaction</h2>
            <p>Over the past few decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially neural network technology, has evolved from merely mimicking the structure of the human brain to deeper biological simulations and practical applications. Neural networks are not just computational tools; they are profoundly influencing our culture, social ethics, and environmental interactions. This article will explore how neural networks finely simulate brain functions from a biological perspective, their role in cultural dissemination, their applications in environmental protection and sustainable development, and the challenges and opportunities these developments bring.</p>

            <h3>Refinement of Neuron Models and Simulation of Brain Functions</h3>
            <h4>Synaptic Plasticity and Learning Mechanisms</h4>
            <p>The development of neural networks initially drew from the brain's structure, but now they are learning from more intricate biological mechanisms. For example, synaptic plasticity is key to brain learning and memory. By simulating Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and Long-Term Depression (LTD), AI can achieve more dynamic learning capabilities. The application of Hebbian learning rules allows neural networks to mimic the strengthening process of synapses, enhancing their ability to recognize complex patterns. This simulation is not just a technological advancement but also a deepening of our understanding of human cognitive processes.</p>

            <h4>Balance of Excitatory and Inhibitory Activity</h4>
            <p>In the brain, neurons regulate activity through a balance of excitatory and inhibitory signals, and neural networks also need this balance to optimize performance. Introducing inhibitory mechanisms can help networks better handle noise, improve generalization capabilities, and mimic computational processes closer to those of the biological brain. This balance not only aids in enhancing the intelligence level of AI but also provides new perspectives on how the human brain processes information.</p>

            <h4>Diversity of Neurons</h4>
            <p>The complexity of the human brain partly comes from the diversity of different neuron types. Traditional neural network models often simplify this diversity, but modern AI research is introducing neuron models with different functions, like pyramidal cells and basket cells. This diversity simulation can increase the complexity and flexibility of information processing within networks, pushing AI towards more intelligent development.</p>

            <h3>Brain-Computer Interfaces and Interaction with Cultural Dissemination</h3>
            <h4>Applications of Brain-Computer Interfaces</h4>
            <p>Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology allows AI to interact directly with the human brain, not limited to medical applications like helping paralyzed patients control external devices, but also extending to understanding and simulating human cognitive processes. Through deep learning, BCIs can analyze brainwave data to predict or reconstruct a userâ€™s intentions or cognitive states, opening up deeper explorations of human thought.</p>

            <h4>Cultural Dissemination and Neural Networks</h4>
            <p>The role of neural networks in cultural dissemination is increasingly significant. They not only generate and understand cultural works but also influence the dissemination and consumption of culture through algorithmic recommendation systems. However, this also poses challenges to cultural diversity. AI might inadvertently promote cultural homogenization, squeezing out space for niche cultures. Thus, protecting cultural diversity while advancing technology becomes a critical issue.</p>

            <h4>Ethics and Social Justice</h4>
            <p>The application of AI, particularly neural networks, brings many ethical and social justice issues. Algorithmic biases, privacy invasion, and automation of jobs are significant challenges to be addressed. Ensuring transparency and interpretability of AI systems, establishing legal frameworks to protect privacy, and addressing the impact of automation on employment through education and retraining are essential to ensure that technological progress does not undermine social justice.</p>

            <h3>Environmental Sensing and Eco-Friendly Computing</h3>
            <h4>Environmental Monitoring and Response</h4>
            <p>Neural networks show tremendous potential in environmental monitoring and response. By processing vast amounts of environmental data, AI can predict climate changes, monitor ecosystem shifts, and provide disaster warnings. This capability not only aids in environmental protection but also pushes for a deeper understanding of natural systems.</p>

            <h4>Eco-Friendly Computing</h4>
            <p>While neural networks contribute significantly to environmental sensing, their computing processes can burden the environment. Researchers are therefore working on developing more energy-efficient algorithms and using renewable energy for computing infrastructure. Additionally, neural networks are used to optimize energy use and resource allocation, reducing waste and promoting sustainable development.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>From a biological perspective, the study and application of AI are not just technological advancements but also profound explorations of human intelligence and environmental interactions. The applications of neural networks in simulating brain functions, cultural dissemination, and environmental interaction bring both new opportunities and challenges. We need to find a balance in technological innovation, policy-making, and social engagement to ensure that AI development is not only efficient and innovative but also responsible and sustainable. Future AI will not just be an extension of human intelligence but will become an important tool for understanding and protecting ourselves and our environment.</p>
