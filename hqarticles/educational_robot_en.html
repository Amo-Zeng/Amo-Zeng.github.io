            <h3>I. Robot Mentors: Revolutionizing Personalized Learning</h3>
            <p>Traditional educational models often follow uniform teaching progress and fixed methods, making it difficult to meet the personalized needs of students, leading some to lose interest in learning and even develop aversion to it. As "robot mentors," educational robots bring groundbreaking changes to personalized education with the support of artificial intelligence technologies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gamified Learning:</strong> Robot mentors transform dull knowledge points into enjoyable tasks through gamified learning, stimulating students' learning motivation.</li>
                <li><strong>Instant Feedback:</strong> Relying on AI technology, robot mentors can capture students' learning processes in real-time and provide instant feedback based on their performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Interaction:</strong> Through emotional interaction technology, robot mentors engage in deep emotional interactions with students.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>II. Robot Peers: Building New Learning Communities</h3>
            <p>Educational robots are not only mentors but also "robot peers" that cultivate students' collaboration, communication, and social skills through interaction, promoting the formation of new learning communities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Collaborative Learning:</strong> As core members of group learning, robots work together with students to complete tasks such as programming and building robots.</li>
                <li><strong>Role-Playing:</strong> Robot peers can simulate different roles like teachers and doctors, helping students learn social skills and empathy in virtual environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Remote Learning:</strong> Robots can act as students' proxies participating in classroom interactions, overcoming loneliness and building virtual learning communities.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>III. Robot Platforms: Empowering Teachers and Students, Unleashing Creativity</h3>
            <p>Educational robots are not just learning tools but also open platforms that provide teachers and students with rich resources and tools, stimulating their creativity and exploration spirit.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Programming and Maker Education:</strong> Through programming functions, educational robots offer students opportunities to explore logical thinking and creativity.</li>
                <li><strong>STEAM Education:</strong> Educational robots align closely with STEAM education principles, providing students with interdisciplinary learning experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Educational Resource Sharing:</strong> Educational robot platforms aggregate global high-quality educational resources, offering teachers and students broader learning spaces.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>IV. Looking Ahead: The Infinite Possibilities of Educational Robots</h3>
            <p>As a bridge between technology and education, educational robots are injecting new vitality into future education. They not only help students master programming skills and STEAM knowledge but, more importantly, cultivate their creativity, logical thinking, and problem-solving abilitiesâ€”core competencies needed in future society.</p>
