            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Language contact is one of the major driving forces behind language evolution, especially in multilingual environments where interactions between languages often lead to significant changes in phonological features. Traditional phonological studies typically view language contact as a static borrowing process, where one language borrows specific phonological features from another. However, as research has progressed, more scholars are beginning to recognize that the impact of language contact on phonological evolution is far more complex than static borrowing. This paper will explore how language contact contributes to the borrowing, competition, and evolution of phonological features from a dynamic perspective, and will analyze nonlinear, self-organizing, and emergent phenomena in phonological evolution using complex systems theory.</p>

            <h3>Phonological Evolution in Specific Linguistic Areas</h3>
            <p>The Horn of Africa and the Southeast Asian islands are regions with some of the most significant language contact phenomena. In these areas, multiple languages are closely intertwined geographically and culturally, forming complex language contact networks. For example, in the Horn of Africa, Amharic has gradually absorbed foreign phonological features during its contact with other languages, such as new consonant and vowel pronunciations. Simultaneously, some of the original phonological features have also changed due to competition with other languages, such as mergers or disappearances of certain phonemes. The Southeast Asian islands exhibit similar dynamic evolutionary patterns. For instance, Malay in Indonesia, during its contact with other languages, has gradually formed a mixed phonological system that includes both indigenous and foreign phonological features.</p>

            <h3>Borrowing, Competition, and Evolution of Phonological Features</h3>
            <p>During language contact, the borrowing of phonological features is not a simple replication process but a complex dynamic interaction. Firstly, borrowed phonological features often undergo a series of adaptive changes in the target language to fit its phonological structure. Secondly, the borrowing of phonological features often triggers competition among the target language's original phonological features. During this competition, some features may be preserved, while others may be eliminated. Finally, the borrowing and competition of phonological features often lead to the overall evolution of the target language's phonological system.</p>

            <h3>Impact of Bilingual and Multilingual Phenomena on Phonological Features</h3>
            <p>Bilingual and multilingual phenomena are common forms of language contact, especially in multilingual environments where individuals and groups often use multiple languages simultaneously. In such environments, changes in phonological features not only occur through borrowing and competition between languages but also through changes in individual and group phonological features. Firstly, bilingual and multilingual phenomena often lead to the redistribution of phonemes. Secondly, these phenomena often result in the emergence of new phonemes. Finally, bilingual and multilingual phenomena not only lead to phoneme redistribution and the emergence of new phonemes but also contribute to individual differences and group characteristics in phonological evolution.</p>

            <h3>Phonological Evolution from the Perspective of Complex Systems Theory</h3>
            <p>Complex systems theory provides a new perspective for understanding the nonlinear and self-organizing phenomena in phonological evolution. During language contact, the borrowing and evolution of phonological features often exhibit nonlinear characteristics. Additionally, self-organizing phenomena in phonological evolution are also an important subject of study in complex systems theory. Emergent phenomena, another key concept in complex systems theory, refer to new properties that appear at the system level, which are generated through interactions among the system's components.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The dynamic impact of language contact on phonological evolution is far more complex than traditional static borrowing. By studying language contact in specific linguistic areas, analyzing the impact of bilingual and multilingual phenomena on phonological features, and applying complex systems theory, we can gain a deeper understanding of the nonlinear, self-organizing, and emergent phenomena in phonological evolution.</p>
