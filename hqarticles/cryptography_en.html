            <h3>Revision Highlights</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Added specific cases and details:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the section "The Impact of Quantum Computing on Traditional Encryption," descriptions of the specific threats to RSA and ECC algorithms under quantum computing were added, making the issue more intuitive and concrete.</li>
                        <li>In the section "Frontier Applications of Quantum Key Distribution," practical application scenarios of the BB84 protocol, such as financial transactions, government, and military communications, were supplemented, helping readers better understand the potential and limitations of QKD.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Optimized logical structure:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the section "Ethical Dilemmas and Solutions," the discussion unfolded through three dimensions: technology, law, and social consensus, with a clear hierarchy and logical flow. Particularly in the legal section, differences in privacy protection laws between Europe and the U.S. were compared, revealing policy conflicts in a globalized context.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced professionalism:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the section "Post-Quantum Cryptography Responses," the latest progress of the NIST standardization process, such as candidate algorithms entering the third round, was added, further enhancing the article's professionalism and timeliness.</li>
                        <li>In the section "Quantum Key Distribution," the working mechanisms of quantum mechanics principles (non-cloning and quantum entanglement) were explained in detail, making the core concepts of this technology understandable to non-specialist readers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Improved readability:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>By adding specific examples and metaphors, such as "RSA encryption relies on the difficulty of large integer factorization, while Shor's algorithm can efficiently accomplish this task on a quantum computer," complex cryptography concepts became more accessible.</li>
                        <li>In the section "Ethical Dilemmas," the confrontation between the FBI and Apple was used as a vivid example to illustrate the conflict between national security and personal privacy in encryption technology, enhancing the article's appeal.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Thoughtful future outlook:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the "Future Outlook" section, the article not only discussed the challenges of privacy protection in a globalized context but also delved into the new requirements posed by the rapid development of artificial intelligence and big data technologies to cryptography, showcasing the author's deep insights into future technological development.</li>
                        <li>In the "Conclusion" section, by summarizing the historical evolution and future challenges of cryptography, the article elevated the discussion to a reflection on the direction of digital society development, enhancing the article's depth of thought.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
