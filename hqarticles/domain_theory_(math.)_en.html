            <h2>Class Field Theory: A Bridge Between Mathematics and Multiple Disciplines</h2>
            <p>Class Field Theory, a core component of algebraic number theory, was originally developed to study the abelian extensions of number fields and their Galois groups. However, with the deep integration of mathematics with other disciplines, the applications of Class Field Theory have far exceeded its initial mathematical framework, extending to fields such as machine learning, cryptography, string theory, quantum field theory, and condensed matter physics. This article will delve into the cross-disciplinary applications of Class Field Theory in these areas, revealing how it provides new perspectives and tools for different disciplines, promoting the integrated development of theoretical innovation and practical application.</p>

            <h3>1. Applications of Class Field Theory in Machine Learning: An Algebraic Perspective from Feature Selection to Model Interpretation</h3>
            <p>Machine learning has achieved significant progress in areas such as image recognition and natural language processing. However, as model complexity continues to increase, understanding their decision-making processes becomes increasingly challenging. Class Field Theory offers a unique algebraic perspective to this problem, particularly in feature selection and model interpretation, showing significant potential.</p>
            <h4>1.1 Algebraic Structures in Feature Selection</h4>
            <p>Feature selection is a critical step in machine learning to extract relevant features from raw data. Traditional methods, such as mutual information and chi-square tests, often ignore the potential algebraic structures of the data. Class Field Theory, by introducing Galois theory and algebraic varieties from algebraic number theory, reveals algebraic patterns in feature spaces, thereby helping to identify feature subspaces relevant to specific tasks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Image Recognition Field</strong>: By studying the abelian extensions of feature spaces, it is possible to identify feature subspaces related to specific object categories, such as geometric shapes and texture patterns. These algebraic structures provide deeper mathematical support for image classification and recognition.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Language Processing Field</strong>: The algebraic structure of word embeddings can be described through algebraic varieties, revealing semantic relationships between words. For example, Class Field Theory can help identify semantic clusters in word vector spaces, improving the performance of natural language processing models.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.2 Algebraic Enhancement of Model Interpretation</h4>
            <p>Existing model interpretation methods, such as SHAP values and LIME, are primarily based on statistics and game theory. Class Field Theory significantly enhances the explanatory power of these methods by introducing algebraic structures.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Algebraic Perspective on SHAP Values</strong>: By studying the abelian extensions of feature spaces, it is possible to identify feature subspaces highly correlated with prediction results, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of explanations.</li>
                <li><strong>Algebraic Optimization of LIME</strong>: Treating local neighborhoods as algebraic varieties allows for a deeper understanding of feature importance and reveals the local decision-making mechanisms of models.</li>
            </ul>
