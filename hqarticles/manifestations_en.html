            <h2>Self-Awareness, Digital Age, and Cultural Differences: Building a New Perspective on Diverse Expression</h2>
            <p>In the complex web of human society, the relationship between expression and self-awareness is intertwined like a mirror and its reflection. Especially in the context of the digital age, social media and digital platforms have profoundly changed the way people express themselves. At the same time, globalization has made the differences in expression among different cultures increasingly evident. In this environment of diversity and tension, how to coordinate self-awareness, digital expression, and cultural differences becomes a subject worthy of in-depth exploration.</
