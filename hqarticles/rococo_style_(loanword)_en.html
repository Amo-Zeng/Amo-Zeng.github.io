            <h2>The Multifaceted Dimensions of Rococo Style</h2>
            <p>Rococo style, as a gem of 18th-century European art, is celebrated for its lightness, complexity, and sensual qualities, making it a beloved decorative art among the aristocracy. However, a deeper exploration of its historical and cultural background reveals that Rococo is not merely a pursuit of elegance and sensuality; it is also a subtle expression of feminine power during the Enlightenment Era, a testament to the intertwining of science and aesthetics, and a vivid example of cross-cultural dialogue under globalization.</p>

            <h3>I. Lightness and Constraint: Feminine Power in Rococo Style</h3>
            <p>The "lightness" of Rococo style is not only a visual aesthetic but also a metaphor for women seeking power in society. Female artists during the Rococo period expressed their resilience in seeking self-empowerment through artistic mediums. For instance, in the works of the Frenchwoman Angelica Kauffman, female figures appear in delicate yet vibrant poses, embodying both a rebellion against traditional gender roles and a subtle hint of feminine power.</p>

            <p>Rococo art is not merely a decorative style seeking sensory pleasure; it is also a witness to the interplay of science and aesthetics during the Enlightenment Era. The Rococo artists' passionate embrace of nature foreshadowed the scientific exploration of nature in the Enlightenment movement. The dynamic expression in Rococo art also presaged the emergence of Darwin's theory of evolution.</p>
