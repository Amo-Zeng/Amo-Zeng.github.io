            <h2>The Specificity and Challenges of Festive Food Safety</h2>
            <p>Food safety issues during festivals have their own specificity. Firstly, the variety of festive foods is extensive, covering meat, seafood, pastries, sweets, and more. The storage, processing, and cooking of these foods are complex, making them susceptible to environmental contamination or improper handling. Secondly, the consumption of food surges during festivals, with families and catering businesses often preparing large quantities of ingredients in advance. This poses higher demands on ingredient storage and management. Additionally, festive food preparation often involves multiple people working together, making the hygiene conditions of food processing sites and the food safety awareness of operators potential risk points.</p>

            <h2>Formulation and Implementation of Festive Customized Food Safety Standards</h2>
            <p>Festive customized food safety standards serve as a supplement and refinement to traditional food safety standards, aiming to address the special needs of festive foods and ensure the safety and health of festive dining. The core content includes the following aspects:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Refined Storage and Processing Standards</strong>  
                    The storage and processing of festive foods are key to ensuring food safety. Customized standards should specify detailed requirements for storage time and temperature control, particularly for widely used festive foods like meat, seafood, and pastries.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening Processing Environment and Personnel Management</strong>  
                    The festive food processing environment often faces challenges with multiple people collaborating and high workloads, increasing the risk of cross-contamination. Therefore, customized standards should require clean processing sites and regular disinfection.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Standardizing Food Packaging and Information Labeling</strong>  
                    The safety and transparency of food packaging are particularly important during festivals. Customized standards should mandate that food packaging be securely sealed to prevent contamination during storage and transportation.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Formulating Emergency Plans and Traceability Mechanisms</strong>  
                    Festive food safety issues can have a broader impact, so customized standards should include emergency plans and food traceability mechanisms.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <section>
            <h2>Food Safety Traceability System: The Cornerstone of Festive Food Safety</h2>
            <p>The food safety traceability system uses information technology to record and track the entire supply chain of food from production, processing, transportation to sales, ensuring that in the event of a food safety issue, the source of the problem can be quickly identified and appropriate measures can be taken. Festive food safety issues have their own specificity, primarily due to the complexity of the food supply chain and the concentrated nature of food consumption.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Festive Food Safety Education: Enhancing Public Awareness for a Healthy Festival</h2>
            <p>Ensuring festive food safety not only relies on the support of standards and technology but also requires the active participation and correct understanding of the public. Through festive food safety education, public food safety awareness can be effectively enhanced, helping consumers make safer and healthier food choices during festivals.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Festivals are significant moments for emotional exchange and cultural heritage, while food safety is the foundation of festive joy. Through a tripartite solution of festive customized food safety standards, food safety traceability systems, and festive food safety education, we can effectively address the special needs of festive foods and safeguard the safety and health of festive dining.</p>
