            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the early 21st century, global value chains were built around the principle of "efficiency maximization," forming a global production network highly dependent on single nodes. In recent years, however, multiple pressures ‚Äî including geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions, technological decoupling, and green transformation ‚Äî have accelerated the trends of "regionalization," "shorter supply chains," and "local technological development." In this transformation, regional trade agreements (RTAs) have emerged as strategic tools to enhance national "regional anchoring capacity."</p>

            <h2>RTAs and Regional Anchoring Capacity</h2>
            <p>Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) are not only instruments of trade liberalization but also crucial means for shaping regional economic integration. Through deep regulatory harmonization, RTAs help member countries establish institutional linkages that enhance the stickiness of economic networks. This "anchoring" capability enables member states to seek alternatives within the region when facing external shocks, thus reducing risks arising from global value chain volatility.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Institutional Integration</strong> ‚Äî Enhancing regional coordination efficiency through integration of standards, regulations, and data interoperability.</li>
                <li><strong>Restructuring of Industrial Chains</strong> ‚Äî Guiding multinational corporations to establish more resilient supply networks within the region.</li>
                <li><strong>Geoeconomic Influence</strong> ‚Äî Enhancing the region's overall voice and bargaining power in international negotiations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>From WTO to RTAs: The Transformation of Global Value Chain Order</h2>
            <p>The multilateral trade system, centered on the WTO, has demonstrated limitations in addressing emerging issues such as data governance, green standards, and carbon tariffs. RTAs are filling this institutional gap by driving the formation of regional economic communities through flexible yet deep multilateral rules. This trend allows major economies such as the U.S., the EU, and China ‚Äî which possess institutional exporting capabilities ‚Äî to strengthen their strategic positions in the global value chain restructuring through leadership in RTA negotiations.</p>

            <h2>China's Strategic Choices Regarding RTAs</h2>
            <p>As the world‚Äôs largest manufacturing hub, China‚Äôs future position in global value chains depends on its ability to strengthen institutional ties with neighboring countries through RTAs. For example, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) provides a framework for economic integration between China and ASEAN countries, serving as a stabilizing force amid global uncertainty.</p>

            <h2>Implications for Global Supply Chains</h2>
            <p>The restructuring of global supply chains is not merely a reshuffling of production networks but an evolution of international economic order. RTAs act as both regional economic anchors and bridges for global trade integration. By reinforcing regional rules of origin, customs coordination, and dispute resolution mechanisms, RTAs not only promote local industrial resilience but also facilitate cross-border economic cooperation beyond traditional WTO frameworks. As globalization undergoes reconfiguration, the balance between regional integration and global openness will shape the next era of international trade and industrial development.</p>
