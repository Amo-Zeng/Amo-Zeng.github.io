            <h2>Introduction: From Ancient Greece to Modern Technology</h2>
            <p>The Euler-Fermat Theorem, a theorem that shines brightly in the field of number theory, is not only an important milestone in the history of mathematics but also a bridge connecting ancient wisdom with modern technology. Its history can be traced back to Ancient Greece, and after generations of mathematicians' exploration and refinement, it reached its peak in the 18th century through Euler. From Diophantus of Ancient Greece to Fermat of the 17th century, and then to Euler of the 18th century, the study of number theory has continuously deepened, revealing profound connections between numbers. This theory not only holds a significant position in pure mathematics but also plays a crucial role in various fields of modern technology.</p>

            <h3>Fermat: The Pioneer of Number Theory</h3>
            <p>Fermat, a 17th-century French lawyer and amateur mathematician, proposed the famous "Fermat's Last Theorem" while reading the works of the Ancient Greek mathematician Diophantus. This theorem states that for integers \( n > 2 \), the equation \( x^n + y^n = z^n \) has no positive integer solutions. This conjecture garnered widespread attention in the mathematical community and was finally proven by Andrew Wiles in 1994. However, Fermat's contributions to number theory extend beyond this. In his studies, he proposed another significant theoremâ€”Fermat's Little Theorem. Fermat's Little Theorem states that for any integer \( a \) and a prime number \( p \), \( a^p \equiv a \pmod{p} \). This theorem, not only elegant in its simplicity, has wide-ranging applications and laid the foundation for subsequent number theory research.</p>

            <h3>Euler: The Culmination of Number Theory</h3>
            <p>Euler, the 18th-century Swiss mathematician, is often hailed as the "universal master" of mathematics. His contributions span number theory, calculus, graph theory, and more. Euler deeply studied Fermat's works and further developed Fermat's ideas. He not only proved Fermat's Little Theorem but also generalized it into a more comprehensive form, known today as the Euler-Fermat Theorem. The Euler-Fermat Theorem states that when \( a \) and \( n \) are coprime, \( a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n} \), where \( \varphi(n) \) is Euler's totient function, defined as the number of positive integers less than \( n \) that are coprime to \( n \). This theorem not only encompasses Fermat's Little Theorem but also reveals more general relationships between numbers.</p>

            <h3>The Cornerstone of Modern Technology: Cryptography, Computer Science, and Physics</h3>
            <p>The applications of the Euler-Fermat Theorem in modern technology are equally extensive and profound. In cryptography, the theorem forms the foundation of the RSA public key encryption algorithm, directly impacting the secure transmission of information. The RSA algorithm leverages the properties of modular arithmetic, particularly the combination of Euler's totient function and Fermat's Little Theorem, to generate public and private keys and perform encryption and decryption processes. This reliability makes the RSA algorithm one of the most widely used public key encryption methods today.</p>
            <p>In computer science, the applications of the Euler-Fermat Theorem are equally significant. Pseudorandom number generators and hash functions are crucial tools in computer science, and the Euler-Fermat Theorem provides the theoretical underpinnings for these tools, ensuring the generated sequences have good randomness and unpredictability. Through the Euler-Fermat Theorem, hash functions play a vital role in data integrity verification, password storage, and digital signatures, ensuring data security and reliability.</p>
            <p>In the field of physics, the applications of the Euler-Fermat Theorem are equally notable. Particularly in quantum mechanics, this theory can be used to describe particle behavior and reveal the wonders of the microscopic world. Through the Euler-Fermat Theorem, physicists can better understand particle behavior, explain phenomena in quantum mechanics such as the phase of wave functions and the calculation of probability amplitudes. This application of mathematical tools not only deepens our understanding of quantum mechanics but also provides theoretical support for cutting-edge fields such as quantum computing and quantum communication.</p>
