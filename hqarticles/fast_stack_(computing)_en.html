            <h2>Fast Reactor Technology: Leading the New Era of Multi-Coupling in Energy Transition</h2>
            <p>In the global effort to combat climate change and achieve carbon neutrality, nuclear energy has long been considered a crucial clean energy source. However, traditional light water reactor technologies face bottlenecks in fuel utilization and nuclear waste management, limiting their widespread application. The advent of fast reactor technology, with its unique advantages, is breaking through these barriers, showcasing tremendous potential, and even promising to become a green energy plant with negative carbon emissions beyond nuclear energy.</p>

            <h3>The "Double Carbon Target" Potential of Fast Reactor Technology</h3>
            <p>Fast reactors, also known as fast neutron reactors, are advanced nuclear reactors that use fast neutrons to trigger nuclear fission reactions. Compared to traditional light water reactors, fast reactors have the following unique advantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Fuel Utilization</strong>: Fast reactors can increase the utilization rate of uranium resources from the current approximately 1% to over 60%, significantly alleviating the pressure of nuclear fuel resource shortages.</li>
                <li><strong>Fast Reactor Transmutation, Waste Termination</strong>: Fast reactors can effectively "burn" and utilize highly radioactive waste generated by traditional nuclear power plants, converting it into low-radioactive or non-radioactive substances, achieving the reduction, harmlessness, and final disposal of nuclear waste, completely solving the nuclear waste problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Negative Carbon Emission, Environmentally Friendly</strong>: Fast reactors hardly emit greenhouse gases during operation, and their high fuel utilization and low nuclear waste characteristics make them have an extremely low carbon footprint throughout their lifecycle, truly becoming a negative carbon emission energy source.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Negative Carbon Emission Green Energy Plant</h3>
            <p>Fast reactor technology is not only "safer and more efficient nuclear energy" but also an efficient "green energy plant." Its "negative carbon emission" advantage is reflected in multiple aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Power Generation</strong>: Fast reactors can provide stable and efficient power output, with almost no greenhouse gas emissions during the power generation process, making them an important zero-carbon electricity source for achieving carbon neutrality.</li>
                <li><strong>Thermal Energy Application</strong>: The high-temperature heat produced by fast reactors can also be used in industrial production, desalination, and other fields, replacing traditional fossil fuels and further reducing carbon emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Waste Utilization</strong>: Fast reactors transform nuclear waste through transmutation, converting it into usable resources, achieving waste resource utilization, avoiding environmental pollution and carbon emissions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>From "Nuclear Fuel Cycle" to "Closed Nuclear Fuel Economy"</h3>
            <p>Under the traditional nuclear fuel cycle model, the disposal and handling of spent fuel remain a challenge. Fast reactor technology will completely change this situation, opening a new era of "closed nuclear fuel economy."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maximized Resource Utilization</strong>: Fast reactors can use depleted uranium and thorium, converting them into nuclear fuel and reusing useful components in spent fuel, maximizing nuclear fuel resource utilization.</li>
                <li><strong>New Safety Management Model</strong>: Fast reactors produce less radioactive waste with shorter lifespans, making them easier to manage and dispose of safely, providing more secure and reliable guarantees for the sustainable development of nuclear energy.</li>
                <li><strong>New Economic Growth</strong>: Under the "closed nuclear fuel economy" model, nuclear fuel utilization efficiency is significantly improved, costs are reduced, and new industries and economic growth points are generated, injecting new vitality into nuclear energy development.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>From "Single Energy" to "Multi-Coupling"</h3>
            <p>As energy transition deepens, the single energy supply model is increasingly unable to meet the complex and changing future energy demands. Fast reactor technology can synergize with renewable energy, energy storage technology, etc., to build a multi-coupled energy system, ensuring energy security.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best Partner of Renewable Energy</strong>: Fast reactors can provide stable base power, compensating for the intermittency and volatility of renewable energy, complementing each other's advantages to build a more stable and reliable power system.</li>
                <li><strong>New Choice for Distributed Energy</strong>: Small modular fast reactors can be flexibly deployed to provide electricity supply for remote areas, islands, etc., and can also integrate with distributed energy systems to improve energy utilization efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Synergy with Energy Storage Technology</strong>: In a high-temperature environment, fast reactors can combine with high-temperature energy storage technology to realize the storage and release of thermal energy, providing new solutions for building a more flexible energy system.</li>
            </ul>
