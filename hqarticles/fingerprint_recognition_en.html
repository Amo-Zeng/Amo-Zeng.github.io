                    <p>The application of fingerprint recognition technology relies on the collection, storage, and usage of fingerprint data. However, the uniqueness of fingerprint data poses significant challenges in terms of security. Firstly, once fingerprint data is leaked, it is almost impossible to change or remedy. Unlike passwords, fingerprints cannot be frequently changed, meaning a single leak could lead to long-term privacy risks. Secondly, the storage and transmission of fingerprint data require high encryption, but even the most advanced security technologies cannot fully defend against hacker attacks and internal data breaches.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Privacy Concerns: Immutability and Discrimination Risks</strong>
                    <p>The uniqueness of fingerprints makes them an ideal tool for identity verification, but it also raises deep-seated privacy concerns. Once fingerprint information is leaked, individuals face the risk of identity theft, especially in areas such as financial transactions and medical records, where the consequences of misuse could be severe. Additionally, the leakage of fingerprint information could lead to discriminatory applications. For example, some companies may use fingerprint data during the hiring process to unfairly target specific groups, potentially leading to discrimination based on race, gender, or other factors.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Public Safety vs. Personal Privacy</strong>
                    <p>Governments and businesses often need to balance public safety with personal privacy when using fingerprint recognition technology. For instance, governments widely apply fingerprint recognition in criminal investigations and immigration management to enhance public safety. However, over-reliance on fingerprint recognition could lead to the infringement of personal privacy rights. For example, government biometric databases could be used to monitor citizens' daily behavior, raising questions about civil liberties.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Future Ethical Dilemmas: Abuse and Discrimination</strong>
                    <p>As fingerprint recognition technology becomes more widespread, future ethical dilemmas are worth considering. For example, the abuse of fingerprint information could lead to indefinite surveillance of individuals, and in extreme cases, governments might use fingerprint technology to create "holographic citizen profiles," tracking citizens' every move in real-time. Additionally, the discriminatory application of fingerprint recognition technology could exacerbate social inequality. For instance, certain legal systems in some countries might use fingerprint data to digitally discriminate against specific ethnic groups, intensifying social conflicts.</p>

            <h3>Case Analysis: Privacy Controversies in Reality</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Government Database Breaches: The Cost of Public Safety</strong>
                    <p>In 2016, India's "Aadhaar" project was hacked, resulting in the leakage of millions of citizens' fingerprint data. This incident sparked widespread privacy concerns, as many citizens worried that their fingerprint information could be used for illegal activities. Although the Indian government claimed it would enhance data security, the incident highlighted the difficult balance between public safety and personal privacy.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Corporate Misuse of Fingerprint Data: Employees' Privacy Dilemma</strong>
                    <p>In 2018, employees of a US tech company accused the company of abusing fingerprint recognition technology by requiring employees to scan their fingerprints when entering the office, using the data for internal monitoring. Although the company claimed this was for security purposes, employees argued that it infringed on their privacy rights. This case demonstrates that companies may overlook employee privacy when using fingerprint recognition technology.</p>
