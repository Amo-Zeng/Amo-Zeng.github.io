            <h2>A New Era in IoT Security: From Blockchain Integration to Behavioral Analysis</h2>
            <p>The widespread use of IoT (Internet of Things) devices has brought unprecedented convenience but has also exposed significant security vulnerabilities. Traditional security measures are no longer sufficient to handle increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks. Therefore, integrating multiple advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, privacy computing, biometric authentication, and device behavior analysis has become key to addressing IoT security issues. The convergence of these technologies not only enhances the security of IoT devices but also innovatively addresses the evolving security challenges.</p>

            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <h4>Integration of AI and Blockchain</h4>
            <p>The primary role of AI in IoT security is real-time monitoring and anomaly detection. Through machine learning algorithms, AI can analyze device behavior patterns and identify abnormal activities. However, standalone AI monitoring risks data tampering and falsification. Here, the introduction of blockchain technology becomes crucial. Blockchain ensures that all interactions and data transfers between devices are recorded on an immutable public ledger. This feature makes any unauthorized access or data tampering immediately detectable and traceable.</p>
            
            <h4>Privacy Computing and Data Sovereignty</h4>
            <p>IoT devices often collect a large amount of personal data, and traditional security measures might not be enough to protect the privacy of this data. By introducing privacy computing technologies (like federated learning, secure multi-party computation, etc.), devices can perform collaborative computation and data analysis without exposing raw data. Additionally, emphasizing data sovereignty ensures that data is processed within the country or region it was generated, complying with different regional laws and regulations, and reducing the risks associated with data transfer across borders.</p>
            
            <h4>Biometric Authentication and Behavior Analysis</h4>
            <p>Aside from traditional passwords and two-factor authentication, using biometrics (like fingerprints, facial recognition, voice recognition, etc.) and device behavior analysis (such as user usage patterns, device activity times) enhances IoT device security. This approach not only improves the convenience and security of authentication but can also detect anomalies by learning user behavior patterns, preempting potential security threats. For instance, if a smart home system detects unusual device usage patterns during atypical times, it can take immediate protective measures or alert the user.</p>
