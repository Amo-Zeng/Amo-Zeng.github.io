            <h3>I. Basic Concepts and Architecture of WebRTC</h3>
            <h4>1.1 Core Components of WebRTC</h4>
            <p>The core components of WebRTC mainly include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MediaStream</strong>: Responsible for capturing and processing audio and video data, allowing developers to obtain media streams from cameras and microphones.</li>
                <li><strong>RTCPeerConnection</strong>: Used to establish peer-to-peer connections and manage the transmission of audio and video data.</li>
                <li><strong>RTCDataChannel</strong>: Supports the transfer of arbitrary data (such as files, messages, etc.) within a peer-to-peer connection, providing an efficient communication channel.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.2 WebRTC Workflow</h4>
            <p>The workflow of WebRTC can be broken down into the following key steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Media Stream Acquisition</strong>: Obtain media streams from cameras and microphones via the `getUserMedia` API.</li>
                <li><strong>Signaling Exchange</strong>: Exchange session description protocol (SDP) and network information (ICE Candidate) through a server or other signaling mechanisms to establish a peer-to-peer connection.</li>
                <li><strong>Connection Establishment</strong>: Use `RTCPeerConnection` to establish a peer-to-peer connection for audio and video data transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Transmission</strong>: Use `RTCDataChannel` to transmit files, messages, or other arbitrary data.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>1.3 WebRTC Network Architecture</h4>
            <p>WebRTC employs the ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) framework to automatically select the best network path. ICE handles NAT traversal and network address translation issues through STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) and TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) servers, ensuring stable connections in complex network environments.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>II. WebRTC Development Practice</h3>
            <h4>2.1 Establishing Peer-to-Peer Connections</h4>
            <p>Below is a simple WebRTC peer-to-peer connection example, demonstrating how to implement audio-video calls:</p>
            <pre><code>// Obtain local media stream
const localStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true });
document.getElementById('localVideo').srcObject = localStream;

// Create RTCPeerConnection object
const pc = new RTCPeerConnection();

// Add local media stream
localStream.getTracks().forEach(track => pc.addTrack(track, localStream));

// Listen for remote media stream
pc.ontrack = event => {
    document.getElementById('remoteVideo').srcObject = event.streams[0];
};

// Signaling exchange part (assume signaling exchange via WebSocket)
const signalingChannel = new WebSocket('wss://your-signaling-server.com');

signalingChannel.onmessage = async message => {
    const data = JSON.parse(message.data);
    if (data.sdp) {
        await pc.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(data.sdp));
        if (pc.signalingState !== 'stable') {
            const answer = await pc.createAnswer();
            await pc.setLocalDescription(answer);
            signalingChannel.send(JSON.stringify({ sdp: pc.localDescription }));
        }
    } else if (data.candidate) {
        await pc.addIceCandidate(new RTCIceCandidate(data.candidate));
    }
};

pc.onicecandidate = event => {
    if (event.candidate) {
        signalingChannel.send(JSON.stringify({ candidate: event.candidate }));
    }
};

// Create offer and send to the other peer
const offer = await pc.createOffer();
await pc.setLocalDescription(offer);
signalingChannel.send(JSON.stringify({ sdp: pc.localDescription }));</code></pre>
            <h4>2.2 Implementing Audio-Video Calls</h4>
            <p>In the example above, we have implemented the basic functionality of audio-video calls. We use `getUserMedia` to obtain the local media stream, and `RTCPeerConnection` to establish a peer-to-peer connection, finally rendering the remote media stream into a `<video>` element.</p>
            <h4>2.3 Transferring Files and Other Data</h4>
            <p>WebRTC can not only be used for audio-video calls but also for transferring files or other data through `RTCDataChannel`. Below is a simple file transfer example:</p>
            <pre><code>const dataChannel = pc.createDataChannel('fileTransfer');

dataChannel.onmessage = event => {
    const file = new Blob([event.data], { type: 'application/octet-stream' });
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(file);
    const a = document.createElement('a');
    a.href = url;
    a.download = 'receivedFile';
    document.body.appendChild(a);
    a.click();
    document.body.removeChild(a);
};

document.getElementById('fileInput').addEventListener('change', event => {
    const file = event.target.files[0];
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onload = () => {
        dataChannel.send(reader.result);
    };
    reader.readAsArrayBuffer(file);
});</code></pre>
            <p>In this example, we create an `RTCDataChannel` for file transfer, listen to the `onmessage` event to receive files, and use `FileReader` to read the file as an `ArrayBuffer` before sending it.</p>

            <h3>III. Advanced Features of WebRTC</h3>
            <h4>3.1 Audio-Video Processing</h4>
            <p>WebRTC provides a rich set of audio-video processing APIs, allowing developers to perform operations such as clipping, compressing, and mixing on audio-video streams. For example, `MediaStreamTrack` can be used to process individual audio and video tracks:</p>
            <pre><code>const audioTrack = localStream.getAudioTracks()[0];
audioTrack.applyConstraints({ echoCancellation: true });</code></pre>
            <h4>3.2 Network Quality Monitoring</h4>
            <p>WebRTC has built-in network quality monitoring features. Developers can obtain network status information via the `getStats` method of the `RTCPeerConnection` object:</p>
            <pre><code>pc.getStats(null).then(stats => {
    stats.forEach(report => {
        if (report.type === 'candidate-pair' && report.selected) {
            console.log('Round trip time:', report.currentRoundTripTime);
        }
    });
});</code></pre>
            <h4>3.3 Integration with Other Web Technologies</h4>
            <p>WebRTC can seamlessly integrate with other web technologies such as WebSocket, WebAssembly, WebGL, etc., to extend its functionality. For example, signaling exchange via WebSocket, 3D rendering via WebGL, and high-performance computing via WebAssembly.</p>

            <p>When debugging WebRTC applications, you can use browser developer tools, especially the Network and Media tabs, to monitor network traffic and media streams. Additionally, `console.log` and `debugger` statements can help developers locate issues.</p>
            <h4>4.2 Optimizing WebRTC Applications</h4>
            <p>Optimizing WebRTC applications can be approached from the following aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduce Bandwidth Consumption</strong>: Adjust video encoding parameters via the `setParameters` method of `RTCRtpSender` to reduce bandwidth consumption.</li>
                <li><strong>Handle Packet Loss</strong>: Obtain packet loss information via the `getContributingSources` method of `RTCRtpReceiver` and adjust video quality accordingly.</li>
                <li><strong>Use TURN Servers</strong>: In complex network environments, using TURN servers can improve connection success rates.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>V. WebRTC and Privacy Security</h3>
            <p>Although WebRTC has shown great potential in the field of real-time communication, it still faces some security risks during data transmission. Below are some strategies to enhance WebRTC security:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use HTTPS and WSS Protocols</strong>: Ensure that data is always encrypted during transmission to prevent interception and tampering.</li>
                <li><strong>Implement Strict Access Control</strong>: Use authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authenticated users can access WebRTC services.</li>
                <li><strong>Conduct Regular Security Audits</strong>: Regularly audit WebRTC applications to identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>VI. Conclusion</h3>
