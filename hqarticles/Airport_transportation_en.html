            <h2>Airport Transportation: A Multidimensional Narrative Connecting the World</h2>
            <p>Airports, as the hubs of modern society, are not only transition nodes in geographical space but also the convergence points of social inclusiveness, environmental protection, and urban cultural expression. The airport transportation system, as the critical link connecting airports and cities, profoundly influences the travel experiences of different groups, environmental sustainability, and the shaping of the city's brand. This article explores the multifaceted significance of airport transportation from three dimensions: social inclusiveness, climate change response, and urban cultural expression, and seeks to envision a future transportation system that is more inclusive, green, and culturally expressive.</p>

            <h3>Social Inclusiveness: Who Is Excluded from Air Travel?</h3>
            <p>The convenience of the airport transportation system directly affects the accessibility of air travel; however, many groups are marginalized within this system. Low-income individuals face high 'last-mile' costs, people with disabilities face insufficient accessibility facilities, and the elderly struggle with both the digital divide and physical limitations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low-Income Groups:</strong> Excluded from air travel due to the high cost of airport transportation.</li>
                <li><strong>People with Disabilities:</strong> Many obstacles remain in external transportation connections at airports.</li>
                <li><strong>Elderly:</strong> Struggling with the dual challenges of the digital divide and physical limitations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Climate Change: The Path to a Greener Future for Airport Transportation</h3>
            <p>Airport transportation systems are not only crucial indicators of social inclusiveness but also key areas for addressing climate change. The high carbon emissions from traditional modes of transportation such as private cars and taxis have become drivers of climate change, while the exploration of green transportation models offers new possibilities for the future of airport transportation.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Traditional Airport Transportation Modes:</strong> High carbon emissions from private cars and taxis.</li>
                <li><strong>Green Transportation Modes:</strong> Electrification, shared mobility, and technological applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Applications:</strong> Hydrogen buses, autonomous electric vehicles, and smart transportation systems.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Building an Inclusive, Green, and Culturally Expressive Future Airport Transportation</h3>
            <p>To construct a more inclusive, green, and culturally expressive airport transportation system requires the joint efforts of governments, businesses, and the public.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Social Inclusiveness:</strong> Governments increase infrastructure investment, businesses introduce preferential policies.</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Change Response:</strong> Governments implement incentive policies, businesses increase investment in green infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>Urban Cultural Expression:</strong> Designs incorporate urban cultural traits, conveying the city's story.</li>
            </ol>
