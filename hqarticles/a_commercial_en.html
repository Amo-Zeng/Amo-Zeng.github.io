            <h2>The Evolution of Advertising: From Information Delivery to Social Interaction and Value Formation</h2>
            <p>Under the impetus of the digital wave, the narrative style of advertising has undergone a profound transformation from "straightforward presentation" to "storytelling." This transformation is not merely an update of advertising strategies but also a reflection of the shift in social values. Traditional advertisements often present product functions and advantages directly and aggressively to consumers, attempting to guide consumption decisions through direct information delivery. However, with the rise of new generations of consumers such as Gen Z, this unidirectional advertising model gradually loses its appeal and influence.</p>

            <h3>From "Unidirectional Transmission" to "Bidirectional Interaction"</h3>
            <p>The rise of social media has completely transformed the unidirectional transmission model of traditional advertising. Unlike traditional media, social media provides an open and interactive platform where interaction between brands and consumers becomes possible. Consumers are no longer mere audiences but creators and disseminators of information, expressing their opinions and needs through comments, sharing, and forwarding. Brands acquire consumer feedback through these interactions, thereby better understanding consumer needs and preferences, adjusting marketing strategies, and enhancing user experience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personalized Recommendations with AI Technology:</strong> Brands can use artificial intelligence technology to recommend personalized products and services based on consumers' browsing history, purchase records, and social behaviors, thereby increasing click-through rates and conversion rates.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration of Online and Offline Activities:</strong> Brands can enhance user engagement through online and offline activities, such as offline experience stores, online interactive games, and virtual reality experiences, allowing consumers to strengthen their brand identity during participation.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumer Participation in Product Design and Marketing Activities:</strong> Brands will increasingly value consumers' opinions and suggestions, inviting them to participate in product design, packaging design, and advertising creative processes, making consumers participants in brand building.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>From "Advertising Information" to "Social Issues"</h3>
            <p>In recent years, the functions and roles of advertising have undergone profound changes. Advertising is no longer limited to delivering product information; it increasingly carries the discussion of social issues and the transmission of values, such as environmental protection, gender equality, and more, becoming a barometer of social trends and values.</p>
            <p>From the brainwashing ads of "I don't care what you think, I only care what I think" to the touching stories like "She Finally Went to the Blind Date Corner," advertisers continuously explore new ways of expression, focusing on broader social issues. Environmental ads showcase the shocking pollution to awaken people's environmental awareness; gender equality ads break stereotypes and call for respect for diverse gender expressions; public service ads focus on vulnerable groups such as left-behind children and disabled individuals, calling for more care and respect from society.</p>

            <h3>Future Outlook: Advertising's Positive Interaction with Society</h3>
            <p>Looking to the future, with technological progress and social development, the roles and functions of advertising will become even more diversified. Advertising will continue to play the role of disseminator of social issues and guide of values, forming a closer interaction with social development.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the advertising industry needs to continuously reflect and improve, establishing more standardized industry standards to ensure the authenticity, objectivity, and value orientation of advertising content, avoiding excessive commercialization and hype. Only in this way can advertising truly become a force for social progress, contributing to the construction of a better society.</p>
