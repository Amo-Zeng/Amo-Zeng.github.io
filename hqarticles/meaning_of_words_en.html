            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In today's rapidly globalizing and digitizing world, language, as the core vehicle for culture, history, and social structures, is facing unprecedented challenges and opportunities. Language is not just a tool for conveying information; it also plays a crucial role in shaping cultural identity, power structures, and social realities. This article explores the interaction and conflict of cross-cultural semantics, the evolution of semantics in the digital age, and the role of semantics in political discourse in modern society.</p>

            <h2>I. Interaction and Conflict of Cross-Cultural Semantics</h2>
            <h3>Vocabulary Valence Differences</h3>
            <p>For instance, in Eastern and Western cultures, the term "Dragon" carries vastly different symbolic meanings. In China, the dragon symbolizes strength and good fortune, whereas in the West, it is often seen as a demon or threat. These differences not only affect daily communication but also reveal deep cultural values and historical contexts. Through such contrasts, we understand how culture is expressed and perpetuated through language.</p>

            <h3>Shifts in Symbolic Meaning</h3>
            <p>Similarly, "Peace" has different connotations across cultures. In East Asian cultures, peace is associated with harmony and stability, while in the West, peace is more linked with the cessation of war and the protection of individual rights. These shifts demonstrate the dynamic nature of language in adapting to social changes.</p>

            <h3>Dynamic Evolution of Semantics</h3>
            <p>Globalization has led to varied interpretations of "globalization" itself. Developing countries might see it as economic opportunity and technological progress, whereas developed nations might view it more as economic expansion and cultural exchange. Such evolution reflects the diversity and complexity of semantics in cross-cultural communication.</p>

            <h2>II. Evolution of Semantics in the Digital Age</h2>
            <h3>Semantic Creation in Digital Environments</h3>
            <p>The rise of social media, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR) technologies has spurred innovation and diversity in semantics. New terms like "going viral" or "screen-sweeping" on social media, and the expansion of semantics from 2D text and images to 3D spaces and interactive experiences through VR/AR, signify profound changes in semantics within digital environments.</p>

            <h3>Deconstruction and Recombination of Semantics</h3>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI), especially natural language processing (NLP), can understand and generate human language, contributing to the deconstruction and recombination of semantics. Technologies like Google Translate not only facilitate cross-cultural communication but also pose new challenges, such as issues with polysemy and ambiguity.</p>

            <h3>Impact of Technology on Human Thought and Communication</h3>
            <p>Digital technology expands the boundaries of human cognition, with AI and big data analytics aiding in more effective use and understanding of semantic information, yet also presenting challenges in establishing effective communication between technology and humans.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>III. Political Nature of Semantics and Power Structures</h2>
            <h3>Semantic Manipulation in Political Discourse</h3>
            <p>Politicians carefully choose words and expressions to shape public understanding of events. For example, by labeling and categorizing (like "radicals"), they simplify complex political stances to guide public emotions.</p>

            <h3>Semantic Control in Legal Texts</h3>
            <p>The ambiguity or clarity of legal texts directly affects power structures. Ambiguous legal provisions might give law enforcement more discretionary power, while clear provisions might limit the exercise of power.</p>

            <h3>Semantic Influence in Media Reporting</h3>
            <p>Media shape public opinion through selective reporting and framing effects. For example, framing the same event as a "protest" or "riot" can have different impacts on public perception and reaction.</p>

            <h3>Semantics and Social Justice</h3>
            <p>The choice and use of semantics can marginalize or empower certain social groups, affecting the realization of social justice. For instance, using labels like "illegal immigrant" or "environmental activist" to define and influence the status of social groups in public discourse.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Under the dual influence of globalization and digitalization, the role of language has become more complex and multifaceted. Through the interaction and conflict of cross-cultural semantics, we understand how cultural differences are expressed through language; through digital technology, we witness the rebirth and transformation of semantics in the information age; through political and legal contexts, we recognize semantics as a tool in power struggles. Understanding and leveraging these multiple functions of language will aid in promoting cultural coexistence and development, ensuring coordination between technology and human communication, and advancing social justice and equity. Ultimately, language will continue to serve as a key medium for understanding the world, building relationships, and forming cultural identities.</p>
