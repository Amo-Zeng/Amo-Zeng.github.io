            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Powered by the rapid advancements in precision medicine and genomics, microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as crucial tools in personalized medicine, serving as key gene regulatory molecules. miRNAs play a central role in gene expression regulation and are deeply influenced by environmental factors, which can be further analyzed through state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. This article delves into the applications of miRNAs in personalized cancer prognosis, the reprogramming effects of environmental factors on miRNA expression, and how AI is facilitating the functional analysis and clinical application of miRNAs, thereby ushering personalized medicine into a new era.</p>

            <h2>Application of miRNAs in Personalized Cancer Prognosis</h2>
            <p>The potential of miRNAs in cancer prognosis has been well-established. Their stability in body fluids enables non-invasive detection, and their high sensitivity and tissue specificity make them ideal biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis assessment. For instance, the overexpression of miR-21 in various cancers is closely associated with poor prognosis. Based on this, predictive models can accurately identify high-risk patients and tailor personalized treatment strategies. Additionally, miRNAs can be used to evaluate treatment efficacy and predict disease recurrence. By monitoring changes in miRNA expression levels in real-time, doctors can adjust treatment plans promptly to effectively prevent recurrence.</p>

            <h2>Reprogramming of miRNAs by Environmental Factors</h2>
            <p>The expression of miRNAs is not only driven by genetic factors but also significantly influenced by environmental factors. Various environmental factors such as air pollution, dietary habits, and lifestyle changes alter miRNA expression and function through complex mechanisms, impacting human health. For example, long-term exposure to high levels of PM2.5 may lead to the overexpression of pro-inflammatory miRNAs like miR-21 and miR-155, thereby inducing or exacerbating inflammatory diseases. An increased expression of miR-33 and miR-122 induced by a high-fat diet can lead to adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism disorders, promoting obesity. These environmentally induced miRNA changes are closely related to the occurrence and development of various diseases, providing new tools for environmental monitoring and health assessment.</p>

            <h2>Application of Artificial Intelligence in miRNA Research</h2>
            <p>The application of artificial intelligence in miRNA research is accelerating the development of the field. Deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), can extract complex patterns from large-scale biological data, enhancing the accuracy of miRNA target gene prediction. For example, databases like miRanda and TargetScan have integrated AI technologies to analyze the sequence complementarity, structural stability, and comprehensive biological information between miRNAs and mRNAs, achieving more precise target gene prediction.</p>
            <p>Moreover, AI-driven miRNA functional annotation and disease association analysis provide new clues for disease diagnosis and treatment. By analyzing miRNA expression profiles under different biological states, AI models can identify miRNAs associated with specific functions or diseases. For instance, machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Trees can construct networks of miRNA-disease associations, revealing the role of miRNAs in disease onset, progression, and prognosis.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>AI-Based miRNA Research Platforms and Databases</h2>
            <p>As miRNA research progresses, more platforms and databases are integrating AI technologies to enhance data processing and analysis efficiency. For example, miRBase, miRWalk, and miRDB have integrated AI algorithms to provide more comprehensive and accurate miRNA information. Particularly, deep learning-based miRNA-gene regulatory network models can construct complex regulatory networks from multi-dimensional biological data, revealing interactions between miRNAs and other molecules.</p>
            <p>AI technologies are also accelerating the clinical application of miRNAs. By analyzing miRNA expression profiles from a large number of clinical samples, AI models can identify miRNAs highly associated with specific diseases, improving diagnostic accuracy. For example, miRNA-based early cancer diagnosis models have shown high sensitivity and specificity in several studies. Additionally, AI technologies can optimize miRNA-targeted therapeutic strategies, predicting interactions between miRNAs and drugs to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce side effects.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>As an important biomarker, the role of miRNAs in personalized cancer prognosis, environmental reprogramming, and AI technology application is increasingly prominent. By constructing miRNA-based disease prediction models, researchers can achieve early diagnosis and prognosis assessment for various diseases. The reprogramming effects of environmental factors on miRNAs provide new tools for environmental monitoring and health assessment. The introduction of AI technologies, especially in machine learning and deep learning, provides powerful tools for miRNA functional analysis and disease association, accelerating the clinical application of miRNAs.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, miRNA research will continue to drive the development of precision medicine, providing strong support for a new era of personalized cancer prognosis. With technological advancements and data accumulation, the integration of miRNAs with environmental factors and AI will open new chapters in biomedical research, offering more precise and effective solutions for disease diagnosis and treatment.</p>
