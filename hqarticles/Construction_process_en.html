            <h3>Utilization of Bio-Based Materials</h3>
            <p><strong>Definitions and Types</strong></p>
            <p>Bio-based materials are sustainable materials extracted from plants, microorganisms, or other biological resources, intended to replace traditional petroleum-based materials. These materials have low carbon emissions and are biodegradable, including bioplastics (like PLA), biomass cement, mycelium panels, and algae materials.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bioplastics:</strong> Such as polylactic acid (PLA), can be used for manufacturing flooring, wall panels, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Mycelium Panels:</strong> Grown from mycelium, offering excellent insulation and soundproofing properties.</li>
                <li><strong>Algae Materials:</strong> Produced through photosynthesis by algae, suitable for transparent windows and curtain walls.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Application Examples</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mycelium Panels:</strong> Ecovative has used mycelium to produce panels widely applied in construction, like walls and ceilings. These materials not only have good physical properties but also reduce the demand for traditional wood, thus decreasing deforestation.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Case Study:</strong> In a pilot project in New York, mycelium panels were used to refurbish the interior walls of an old building, significantly reducing indoor temperature fluctuations and improving building efficiency.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Algae Materials:</strong> Algix has developed transparent algae materials for windows, providing natural light and temperature regulation.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Case Study:</strong> In a modern office building in California, the use of algae materials reduced air conditioning energy consumption by up to 20% while enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the building.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bioplastics:</strong> Like PLA, have been used in some projects for flooring and wall panels, reducing carbon footprints.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Case Study:</strong> In an eco-friendly housing project in the Netherlands, internal decorative panels made from PLA not only reduced the overall carbon footprint but also improved indoor air quality.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>3D Printing Construction Technology</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition and Principle</strong></p>
            <p>3D printing in construction uses computer-aided design (CAD) models and 3D printers to layer materials, creating the desired structural forms. Commonly used materials include concrete, plastics, metals, and composite materials.</p>

            <h3>Modernization of Construction Management</h3>
            <p><strong>Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong></p>
            <p>The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in construction management is changing traditional management practices:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Predicting Construction Progress:</strong> Through big data analysis, AI can predict project progress, optimize resource allocation, reduce delays, and cost overruns.</li>
