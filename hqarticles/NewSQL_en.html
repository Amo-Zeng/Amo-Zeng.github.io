            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the wave of global digital transformation, data has become the core resource driving innovation and decision-making. However, the exponential growth in data scale, variety, and complexity presents unprecedented challenges to traditional database technologies. Traditional relational databases (RDBMS) and NoSQL databases each have their strengths, but both show limitations when dealing with massive data volumes, high concurrency transactions, and diverse application scenarios. It is in this context that <strong>NewSQL databases</strong> have emerged, leveraging unique technological innovations and broad application scenarios to gradually break the "three-legged" dominance of traditional database markets and become a key technological force in the data-driven era.</p>

            <h2>The Rise of NewSQL: Disrupting Traditional Landscapes</h2>
            <p>For a long time, the database market has been perceived as a "three-legged" balance among relational databases, NoSQL databases, and NewSQL databases. However, with ongoing technological advancements and expanding application scenarios, NewSQL is gradually breaking this perception by leveraging its unique technological innovations and broad application scenarios, reshaping the database market landscape.</p>
            <p><strong>Relational databases</strong> have long dominated the market due to their strong consistency and extensive support. However, they struggle with performance in handling massive data and high concurrency, especially in distributed environments where scalability and performance are severely limited. <strong>NoSQL databases</strong>, with their high scalability and flexibility, have gained prominence in big data and unstructured data processing. However, NoSQL databases fall short in transaction processing and data consistency, making them unsuitable for industries like finance and e-commerce that require high data consistency.</p>
            <p>It is in this context that <strong>NewSQL databases</strong> have emerged. NewSQL aims to combine the strong consistency of relational databases with the high scalability of NoSQL databases, offering a solution that can handle large-scale data and high concurrency transactions while ensuring data consistency and integrity. Through distributed architectures, strong consistency transaction processing, and user-friendliness, NewSQL databases are gradually breaking the traditional dominance of database markets, becoming an important trend in future database technologies.</p>

            <h2>Core Competencies of NewSQL: Innovative Synergy of Strengths</h2>
            <p>NewSQL databases have successfully broken the established patterns of traditional relational and NoSQL databases through a series of technological innovations. Their core competency lies in the fusion of the strengths of relational databases and NoSQL, while overcoming the limitations of both.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Distributed Architecture and High Performance</strong>
                    <p>NewSQL databases usually adopt distributed architectures, allowing them to easily scale to hundreds or even thousands of nodes, thus maintaining high performance in handling massive data and high concurrency transactions. For example, Google's Spanner and CockroachDB have implemented strong consistency transaction processing on a global scale through distributed architectures. This distributed architecture not only enhances system scalability but also significantly improves system performance and reliability through data sharding and load balancing technologies.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Strong Consistency and Transaction Processing</strong>
                    <p>NewSQL databases ensure high scalability while still supporting ACID transactions, guaranteeing strong data consistency. This is particularly important for industries like finance and e-commerce that require high data consistency. NewSQL databases such as TiDB and YugabyteDB have successfully addressed performance bottlenecks in traditional relational databases in distributed environments through innovative distributed transaction processing mechanisms. For example, TiDB uses the Raft protocol and Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) technology, ensuring transaction consistency and improving concurrency processing efficiency.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>User-Friendliness and Compatibility</strong>
                    <p>NewSQL databases typically support SQL standards, allowing developers to seamlessly migrate existing applications and reducing learning and usage costs. Additionally, NewSQL databases offer rich management tools and automation features, simplifying database operations. For instance, CockroachDB provides a SQL interface compatible with PostgreSQL, enabling developers to easily migrate existing PostgreSQL applications to distributed environments.</p>

            <h2>Expanding Application Scenarios of NewSQL: Diversified Development</h2>
            <p>NewSQL databases not only excel in traditional OLTP scenarios but also show strong potential in data lakes, data warehouses, and real-time analysis.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Challenges and Breakthroughs in OLTP Scenarios</strong>
                    <p>In OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) scenarios, NewSQL databases challenge the dominance of traditional relational databases with their high performance, strong consistency, and user-friendliness. For example, real-time transaction systems in the financial industry and order processing systems in e-commerce platforms require high concurrency and low-latency transaction processing capabilities. NewSQL databases excel in these scenarios through distributed architectures and efficient concurrency control mechanisms.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Integration and Optimization with Data Lakes and Data Warehouses</strong>
                    <p>In data lakes and data warehouses, NewSQL databases integrate with NoSQL and data analysis platforms to provide more flexible and efficient data management and analysis solutions. For example, NewSQL databases like ClickHouse and Apache Doris optimize columnar storage and distributed query engines to support real-time analysis and large-scale data queries, meeting enterprise needs for data analysis and business intelligence.</p>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Empowering AI and Real-Time Analytics</strong>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning place higher demands on real-time processing capabilities for large-scale data. NewSQL needs to optimize its query and storage engines to support complex data analysis and machine learning algorithms. For example, NewSQL can enhance data processing efficiency through vectorized computing and GPU acceleration, and integrate with distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark and TensorFlow to achieve more efficient model training and inference.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Integration with Blockchain and Privacy Computing</strong>
                    <p>Data security and privacy protection are crucial in the data-driven era. NewSQL needs to deeply integrate with blockchain, privacy computing, and other technologies to build a safer and more trusted data ecosystem. For example, NewSQL can leverage blockchain's immutability and transparency to ensure data security and traceability; through privacy computing technologies like federated learning and homomorphic encryption, it can protect user privacy while enabling data sharing and value mining.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Supporting Multimodal Data and Mixed Workloads</strong>
                    <p>The diversity of data types and mixed workloads require NewSQL to have higher flexibility and adaptability. NewSQL needs to support the storage and querying of multimodal data, such as handling unstructured data like text, images, and videos. Additionally, NewSQL needs to optimize its resource scheduling and load balancing mechanisms to address performance challenges in mixed workloads (OLTP and OLAP) scenarios.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
