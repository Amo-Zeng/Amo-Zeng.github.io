            <p>The virtual singer "Luna" with 100,000 fans on Roblox has her signature purple long hair and fluorescent dance moves registered as a virtual trademark within the platform; in Decentraland, the pixel-art avatar of artist "CryptoKai" is used as an NFT avatar series valued at over $500,000. However, when Luna tried to migrate her image to Meta's Horizon Worlds, or when CryptoKai wanted to use his avatar on a Web3 social platform, they faced issues such as trademark invalidation, image rejection, and even account bans. This phenomenon reveals the most fundamental governance conflict in the Metaverse era: <strong>the disconnect between the need for digital identity portability and the reality of platform-dominated IP fragmentation</strong>.</p>

                <h3>1. Digital Identity: From "Platform Asset" to "Personality Extension"</h3>
                <p>In the modern Metaverse, users' digital identities have evolved beyond simple avatars into composites that include the following elements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visual Image</strong> (e.g., hairstyle, clothing, skin tone)</li>
                    <li><strong>Behavioral Data</strong> (e.g., interaction patterns, social graphs, movement trajectories)</li>
                    <li><strong>Virtual Brand</strong> (e.g., nickname, signature moves, virtual goods)</li>
                    <li><strong>Economic Assets</strong> (e.g., NFTs, virtual currency, social influence)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Meta's 2023 user agreement explicitly defines "User-Generated Content (UGC)" as "usage rights under platform license," not ownership. Roblox, through its "virtual goods transaction revenue sharing" mechanism, essentially controls the secondary commercialization of user images. More critically, platforms use algorithms to train on behavioral data (e.g., user preferences, social patterns), generating "behavioral pattern patents"—such as Meta's 2022 application for a "virtual social interaction optimization system," whose underlying data comes from user behavior.</p>
                <p>When users attempt cross-platform migration, these "derivative IPs" face three conflicts:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Trademark Ownership Conflict</strong>: Luna's virtual trademark registered on Roblox was rejected in Horizon Worlds due to "lack of platform-specific recognition";</li>
                    <li><strong>Image Usage Rights Conflict</strong>: CryptoKai's NFT avatar became invalid when connected to a Web3 social protocol because the original platform agreement did not authorize "cross-platform use";</li>
                    <li><strong>Behavioral Patent Infringement Risk</strong>: If a user replicates "signature dance moves" on a new platform, it may trigger behavioral pattern patent litigation from the original platform.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

                <h3>2. The Governance Gap Between Decentralized Identity (DID) and Centralized Platforms</h3>
                <p>Web3's vision is "user-owned data," but the reality is "platform-controlled identity." Current mainstream DID solutions (e.g., ENS, Verifiable Credentials), while enabling identity autonomy, face two major obstacles:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Platform Protocol Priority</strong>: Meta's 2023 "Horizon Worlds Policy Update" states that "all cross-platform use of UGC requires prior platform approval," which directly undermines DID autonomy.</li>
                    <li><strong>IP Registration Fragmentation</strong>: There is currently no unified registration system for virtual trademarks. In 2022, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) rejected 90% of "virtual clothing trademark" applications on the grounds of "lack of evidence of real commercial use"—precisely because usage within the Metaverse is considered "virtual."</li>
                </ol>
                <p>A typical case is the 2023 "Meta vs. AvatarX" lawsuit: Meta accused the decentralized platform AvatarX of allowing users to migrate their Horizon Worlds avatars, constituting "trademark infringement and unfair competition." Although the court has not yet ruled, it exposed the reality of <strong>centralized platforms building "digital identity fences" through user agreements</strong>.</p>
                <p>Another important case is the 2022 "Nike vs. StockX" NFT trademark dispute: Nike accused StockX of unauthorized NFTization and sale of its sneakers, although StockX argued it was "fair use of digital goods." The court tended to believe that virtual goods are also subject to trademark law. This case shows that traditional trademark law has ambiguous applicability in the Metaverse, exacerbating IP conflicts between platforms.</p>

                <h3>3. Governance Innovation: Building a Cross-Platform IP Mutual Recognition Framework</h3>
                <p>Resolving conflicts requires transcending platform logic and establishing a governance system centered on "digital personality rights":</p>
                <p><strong>1. Digital Personhood Right</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Acknowledge that digital identity is an extension of personality, and users have <strong>inalienable rights of attribution, modification, and migration</strong> over it.</li>
                    <li>Drawing on the EU's "Artificial Intelligence Act," require platforms to include clear "identity portability clauses" in user agreements, prohibiting the deprivation of user migration rights through agreements.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>2. Cross-Platform IP Recognition Protocol (CPIRP)</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Led by organizations like WIPO and IEEE, develop <strong>interoperability standards</strong> for virtual trademarks and behavioral patents:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Virtual Trademarks: Establish a "Metaverse Trademark Registration Interoperability Framework" (Meta-TradeMark), allowing mutual recognition of registrations across platforms;</li>
                            <li>Behavioral Patents: Set "cross-platform use exemption clauses for behavioral pattern patents," such as non-commercial migration not constituting infringement.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Use blockchain notarization to record the entire process of IP registration, use, and migration, ensuring traceability.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>3. Virtual IP Registration Interoperability Framework (V-IP Interop Framework)</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Build a decentralized IP registration system where users can register their digital identities and derivative IPs on-chain, obtaining <strong>globally verifiable IP credentials</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Platforms accessing this system must recognize the validity of these credentials, otherwise facing accusations of "digital identity discrimination."</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h3>4. Case Validation: From Conflict to Collaboration</h3>
                <p>In 2023, the Ethereum community launched the "Avatar Freedom" movement, promoting cross-platform mutual recognition of ENS domain names and NFT avatars. Currently, 12 Web3 platforms have signed the "Digital Identity Portability Declaration," allowing users to migrate avatars to different ecosystems with one click. Another case is the "Decentraland Virtual Trademark Pilot": in 2022, Decentraland collaborated with the USPTO, allowing users to submit platform-registered trademarks to the USPTO as evidence of "virtual commercial use," successfully registering three virtual clothing trademarks.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>5. Conclusion: The Core of Metaverse Governance is "People"</h3>
                <p>The true value of the Metaverse lies not in virtual land or NFTs, but in its ability to achieve "digital freedom for people." When users cannot freely migrate with their identities, the Metaverse becomes a "digital prison." We must establish a new IP system based on <strong>digital personality rights, with cross-platform mutual recognition as the path, and global governance as the framework</strong>. Only then can the Metaverse become a bridge connecting reality and virtuality, individuals and collectives, rather than a new battlefield for platform monopolies.</p>
