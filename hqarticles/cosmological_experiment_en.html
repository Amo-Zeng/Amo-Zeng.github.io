            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Cosmology, the scientific field that explores the origin, structure, and evolution of the universe, is at the forefront of technological innovation. With the rapid development of technology, scientists are no longer limited to traditional material observation methods but are beginning to explore the possibilities of non-material observation and participation. These innovative methods, including philosophical thinking, mathematical models, and virtual reality technology, have opened up new perspectives and tools for cosmology research. However, with the advancement of cosmology experimental technology, we also face a series of complex ethical issues, such as safety risks, data privacy and ownership, and resource allocation and fairness. At the same time, new models of global collaboration in this field, such as the coordination of international research projects, open science and data sharing, and deepening interdisciplinary cooperation, are collectively driving the rapid development of cosmology. This article aims to delve into the significance, methods, and potential impacts of non-material observation and participation in cosmology experiments, analyze the cutting-edge technology and ethical decision-making in cosmology experiments, and study new models of global collaboration in cosmology experiments.</p>

            <h3>Non-Material Observation and Participation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Philosophical Thinking</strong>: Philosophy not only provides a deep theoretical foundation for cosmology but also guides us in exploring the essence of the universe, the concepts of time and space, and the possible multidimensional structures in the universe. For example, philosophical interpretations of quantum mechanics help us understand the behavior of microscopic particles in the universe, and this expansion of thought brings new insights to cosmology.</li>
                <li><strong>Mathematical Models</strong>: Mathematics is not only the language of cosmology but also the foundation of its precise predictions. By building mathematical models, scientists can simulate the evolution of the universe and predict its future state. For example, the expansion of the universe can be described by the Friedmann equations, which are direct applications of general relativity, demonstrating the central role of mathematics in cosmology.</li>
                <li><strong>Virtual Reality Technology</strong>: Virtual reality (VR) technology provides cosmologists with unprecedented observational means. Through VR, scientists and the public can "personally experience" the magnificent scenes of the universe, such as the event horizon of black holes and the collision of galaxies. This immersive experience not only helps to understand complex cosmic phenomena more intuitively but also greatly enhances the public's interest and participation in cosmology.</li>

            <h3>Key Issues in Ethical Decision-Making</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Safety Risks</strong>: In high-energy physics experiments, there is a very small possibility of producing micro black holes or other dangerous particles. Although the scientific community generally believes that these risks are extremely low, strict safety assessments are still required. This is not only for the protection of researchers but also for the responsibility to all of humanity.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Privacy and Ownership</strong>: The large amount of data generated by astronomical observations involves issues of copyright and privacy. How to fairly and reasonably allocate and use this data has become a new challenge. This requires us to establish a fair data management mechanism to ensure the reasonable use and clear ownership of the data.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Allocation and Fairness</strong>: Cosmology research requires substantial investment. How to ensure fair resource allocation while meeting research needs and avoid exacerbating global wealth disparities is an important consideration in ethical decision-making. This requires us to establish a fair resource allocation mechanism globally to ensure the fairness and sustainability of research.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>New Models of Global Collaboration</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Coordination of International Research Projects</strong>: For example, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project, which involves the research efforts of over 20 countries, is a large-scale international cooperation model. This model not only accelerates research progress but also promotes technology sharing and talent development, setting a benchmark for global research cooperation.</li>
                <li><strong>Open Science and Data Sharing</strong>: In a globalized context, the open science movement is gradually emerging. Data sharing policies in cosmology research, such as the public release of data from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Planck satellite, have greatly promoted the dissemination of knowledge and in-depth research, providing a new platform for global research cooperation.</li>
                <li><strong>Deepening Interdisciplinary Cooperation</strong>: The development of cosmology requires the integration of multiple disciplines, including physics, astronomy, and computer science. Global interdisciplinary cooperation, such as collaboration between physicists and computer scientists, provides new perspectives and methods for solving complex problems in cosmology, promoting the diversification and in-depth development of research.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Non-material observation and participation, ethical decision-making, and global collaboration are the three pillars driving the development of the field of cosmology. Through philosophical thinking, mathematical models, and virtual reality technology, scientists can not only gain a deeper understanding of the essence of the universe but also effectively popularize cosmology knowledge to the public and promote interdisciplinary cooperation. At the same time, the resolution of ethical issues ensures the healthy development of scientific research, and the deepening of global collaboration provides a broader platform for cosmology research. With the advancement of technology and methodological innovation, cosmology research will continue to explore deeper and broader cosmic mysteries, opening up new paths for the future of humanity.</p>
