            <h3>Balancing Privacy Protection and Data Transparency</h3>
            <p>Enhancing data transparency aids both individual privacy protection and technological innovation. Clear data protection regulations, such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), enable individuals to better control their data and prevent misuse. Simultaneously, data openness and sharing support the development of technologies like artificial intelligence. Techniques such as differential privacy, encryption, and blockchain ensure data security and privacy in transmission and storage. Ethical considerations ensure data usage aligns with societal expectations, avoiding discrimination and injustice.</p>
