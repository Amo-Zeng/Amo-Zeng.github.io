            <h2>From Sigmoid to ReLU: The Evolution of Activation Functions and the Future of Deep Learning</h2>
            <p>In the rapid development of artificial intelligence, neural networks have emerged as the core technology in the field of machine learning due to their powerful nonlinear modeling capabilities. As the "heart" of neural networks, activation functions are not only a reflection of technological innovation but also a manifestation of humanity's deepening understanding of complex systems. This article will delve into the evolutionary journey of activation functions from three perspectives: the rise and fall of the Sigmoid function, the limitations of biological simulation, and the mathematical interpretation of probability and decision boundaries, while looking ahead to their future development directions.</p>

            <h3>1. The Glory and Limitations of Sigmoid: From Theoretical Breakthrough to Deep Learning Bottlenecks</h3>
            <p>The emergence of the Sigmoid function marked a significant breakthrough for neural networks, moving from linear to nonlinear models. Its smooth S-shaped curve not only mimicked the excitability changes of biological neurons but also enabled nonlinear mapping of input signals, allowing neural networks to handle complex pattern recognition tasks. From the 1980s to the 1990s, the Sigmoid function dominated almost all neural network models, becoming the cornerstone of early deep learning.</p>
            <p>However, the design inspiration for the Sigmoid function was drawn from the simplified simulation of biological neurons. The electrical potential changes in biological neurons are a complex dynamic process involving spatial-temporal integration, synaptic plasticity, and dynamic threshold regulation. The Sigmoid function simplified these complex mechanisms into a smooth curve following linear summation, which, while facilitating mathematical processing, lost the true reflection of key biological neuron characteristics. For instance, the output of biological neurons is "all-or-none" spike signals, whereas the output of the Sigmoid function is a continuous probability distribution. This simplification, although convenient in early neural networks, also laid the groundwork for subsequent performance bottlenecks in deep learning.</p>
            <p>As neural network scale expanded and deep learning emerged, the limitations of the Sigmoid function became increasingly apparent. Firstly, when the input values were large or small, the output of the Sigmoid function tended to 0 or 1, causing gradients to approach 0 and leading to severe gradient vanishing problems that hindered the training of deep networks. Secondly, the output distribution of the Sigmoid function within the (0,1) interval lacked diversity, limiting the model's expressive power. Additionally, the computation of the Sigmoid function involved complex exponential operations, significantly increasing computational burden in large-scale deep learning models and reducing training efficiency.</p>

            <h3>2. The Rise of ReLU: From Simple Efficiency to the New Foundation of Deep Learning</h3>
            <p>Facing the challenges posed by the Sigmoid function, researchers began exploring new activation functions. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), with its simple and efficient design, quickly rose to prominence, becoming the new foundation of deep learning. The definition of the ReLU function is:</p>
            <p>$$ \text{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z) $$</p>
            <p>The design philosophy of ReLU is fundamentally different from that of the Sigmoid function. It abandons the complex simulation of biological neurons in favor of computational efficiency and performance improvement. ReLU's nonlinear properties are achieved through a simple "truncation" operation, where its output equals the input when the input is positive and is 0 when the input is negative. This design not only avoids the gradient vanishing problem but also significantly improves computational efficiency.</p>
            <p>The success of ReLU validates the design philosophy of "simplicity and effectiveness." In deep neural networks, ReLU's linear region allows gradients to propagate quickly, while its nonlinear region grants the model powerful representational capabilities. Furthermore, derivative versions of ReLU (such as Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU) have further enhanced model performance, becoming standard components of modern deep learning architectures.</p>

            <h3>3. The Probabilistic and Decision Boundary Interpretation of Sigmoid: From Classification Problems to Model Optimization</h3>
            <p>Although the Sigmoid function has gradually fallen out of favor in deep learning, it still holds significant importance in classification problems. The output range of the Sigmoid function is (0,1), which can be interpreted as the probability that a sample belongs to the positive class. This makes the Sigmoid function a core component in logistic regression models, providing a probabilistic interpretation for classification problems.</p>
            <p>From a decision theory perspective, the decision boundary of the Sigmoid function corresponds to the output of the linear regression model $z=0$. When $z=0$, $ \sigma(z) = 0.5 $, meaning the predicted probabilities for the positive and negative classes are equal, and the input feature space is divided into two regions. This geometric interpretation reveals how the Sigmoid function transforms linear outputs into probability distributions and ultimately influences the decision boundaries of classification models.</p>
            <p>However, the probabilistic interpretation of the Sigmoid function also exposes its limitations. Because its output mean is 0.5 rather than zero-centered, the input distribution to the next layer of neurons deviates from zero, affecting model training efficiency. Additionally, the gradient vanishing problem inherent in the Sigmoid function also exists in classification problems, especially in multi-layer networks where gradients are difficult to propagate to deeper layers, making model training challenging.</p>

            <h3>4. From Historical Evolution to Future Prospects: Activation Function Innovation and the Future of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <p>The rise and fall of the Sigmoid function provide us with profound insights. Firstly, technological innovation is a critical driving force in the development of artificial intelligence. The evolutionary journey of activation functions demonstrates that only by continuously exploring new designs can we address more complex tasks and challenges. Secondly, the philosophy of simplicity and efficiency is crucial in deep learning. The success of ReLU confirms that while pursuing performance, simplicity and interpretability are equally important. Finally, the integration of theory and practice is the core path of AI research. The evolution of activation functions reflects not only technological progress but also an in-depth understanding of biological neuron mechanisms and ongoing exploration of mathematical theory.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, the design of activation functions will continue to evolve in the directions of efficiency, diversity, and biological inspiration. On one hand, researchers need to explore more efficient activation functions to further enhance the performance of deep learning models; on the other hand, the complex mechanisms of biological neurons provide rich inspiration for activation function design. Future activation functions may more closely mimic the dynamic characteristics of biological neurons, such as temporal dependencies and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, research on adaptive activation functions is also worth noting, such as functions that dynamically adjust activation characteristics based on input, which may bring new breakthroughs to deep learning.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>As a classic activation function in deep learning, the Sigmoid function played a significant role in its golden era. However, with the continuous advancement of deep learning technology, the limitations of the Sigmoid function have gradually become apparent, ultimately being replaced by new activation functions like ReLU. This journey is not only a reflection of technological innovation but also provides valuable lessons for exploring the future of artificial intelligence. In future research, we look forward to the emergence of more innovative activation functions, injecting new vitality into the development of AI technology and promoting its application in broader fields.</p>
