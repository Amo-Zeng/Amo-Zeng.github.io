            <h2>From "Passive Defense" to "Multidimensional Governance": Building a New Model for the Integrated Development of Food Safety and Healthy Cities</h2>
            <p>With the acceleration of urbanization and the increasing complexity of the food supply chain, food safety has become a global focus. Traditional food safety regulatory models are often reactive, focusing on post-event investigation, which is a "passive defense" approach, making it difficult to address the increasingly complex challenges of food safety. Meanwhile, food safety issues are not only related to the life and health of the people but also closely linked to the overall governance capabilities of the city and the well-being of its residents. Therefore, how to shift from "passive defense" to "proactive attack" and build an integrated development model that moves from "single dimension" to "multidimensional" has become a key path to enhancing the governance capabilities of food safety.</p>

            <h3>I. From "Passive Defense" to "Proactive Attack": Building a Food Safety Risk Early Warning System</h3>
            <p>Traditional food safety regulatory models predominantly focus on post-event investigation, emphasizing "passive defense," which involves emergency response and accountability after food safety incidents. However, this model has obvious lags and limitations, failing to effectively prevent and control food safety risks. Therefore, building a food safety risk early warning system to achieve a shift from "passive defense" to "proactive attack" has become a key path to enhancing food safety governance capabilities.</p>
            <h4>1.1 Concept and Significance of the Food Safety Risk Early Warning System</h4>
            <p>The food safety risk early warning system is an intelligent system that integrates multi-source data and employs big data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other technological means to monitor, analyze, warn, and predict food safety risks in real-time. Its core goal is to identify potential risks in advance, prevent them from happening, and thereby eliminate food safety hazards at the source.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proactive Risk Identification</strong>: Through real-time monitoring and data analysis, the early warning system can identify potential risks before they manifest and issue warning signals, providing decision-making support for regulatory authorities.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Regulatory Efficiency</strong>: Through big data analysis, the early warning system can quickly locate the source of problems, reducing the workload of regulatory authorities and improving regulatory efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimized Resource Allocation</strong>: The early warning system can dynamically adjust regulatory resource allocation based on risk levels, focusing on high-risk areas to prevent resource waste.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.2 Pathways for Building the Food Safety Risk Early Warning System</h4>
            <p>Building a food safety risk early warning system is a complex system engineering project, requiring systematic planning and implementation from three aspects: data integration, technology application, and mechanism design.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Integration and Sharing of Multi-Source Data</strong>: Comprehensive monitoring of food safety risks relies on various data sources, including regulatory data, public opinion data, consumer data, and environmental data. Building the early warning system first requires establishing a unified data sharing platform to integrate and share multi-source data. Additionally, relevant standards and privacy protection regulations need to be formulated to ensure data security and usability.</li>
                <li><strong>Application and Innovation of Technology</strong>: The application of big data analysis, artificial intelligence, and machine learning is the core support of the food safety risk early warning system. For example, big data analysis can reveal potential risk patterns and trends; artificial intelligence can automatically identify food safety-related information in public opinion; machine learning can predict future food safety risks. Furthermore, blockchain technology can provide technical support for food safety regulation. For instance, blockchain's tamper-proof characteristics can enable full traceability of food production processes, ensuring data authenticity and transparency.</li>
                <li><strong>Establishment and Optimization of Early Warning Mechanisms</strong>: The early warning system can effectively respond to different levels of risks by establishing risk level classification, warning signal issuance, and emergency预案制定,预警系统可以实现对不同等级风险的有效应对。例如,风险等级可以划分为低风险、中风险和高风险,并制定相应的响应措施；预警信号可以通过短信、邮件、APP推送等多种渠道发布；应急预案可以针对不同等级的风险制定相应的应急处理方案。</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. From "Single Combat" to "Collaborative Governance": Building a Food Safety Social Governance Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>Traditional food safety regulatory models overly rely on government departments in a single-combat approach, making it difficult to effectively address increasingly complex food safety risks. In this context, building a food safety social governance ecosystem has become a key path to enhancing food safety governance capabilities.</p>
            <h4>2.1 Corporate Self-Regulation: Strengthening the First Line of Defense for Food Safety</h4>
            <p>Enterprises are the primary responsibility holders for food safety. Only when enterprises conscientiously fulfill their food safety responsibilities can potential safety hazards be fundamentally eliminated. The government should encourage enterprises to establish and improve food safety management systems, implement standardized production, and publicly disclose food safety information through policy guidance and incentive mechanisms, accepting social supervision. At the same time, industry associations should play a bridging role, formulating self-regulatory norms, promoting experience sharing and mutual audits among enterprises, and fostering a good atmosphere of industry self-regulation.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Government Regulation: Transitioning from "Post-Event Investigation" to "Pre-Event Prevention"</h4>
            <p>The government still plays a central role in food safety governance, but its regulatory approach needs to shift from "post-event investigation" to "pre-event prevention." By constructing a food safety risk early warning system, the government can use big data and artificial intelligence technologies to monitor risks in food production, circulation, and consumption in real-time, promptly warning and addressing potential issues. Additionally, the government should strengthen support and standardization for third-party testing institutions to enhance the scientific and authoritative nature of food safety testing, providing technical support for social governance.</p>
            <h4>2.3 Social Collaboration: Expanding Participation Channels for Food Safety Governance</h4>
            <p>The participation of social forces is an important component of food safety social governance. For example, developing third-party food safety testing institutions to provide independent and impartial testing services, making up for the shortcomings of government regulatory resources; establishing food safety volunteer teams to encourage public participation in food safety advocacy, supervision, and reporting; using internet platforms to build food safety information sharing platforms, enabling real-time interaction among the government, enterprises, and the public. Furthermore, internet platforms can serve as important vehicles for social collaboration by creating food safety information sharing platforms that enable real-time interaction among the government, enterprises, and the public, enhancing transparency and participation in food safety governance.</p>
            <h4>2.4 Public Participation: Shifting from "Passive Acceptance" to "Active Involvement"</h4>
            <p>The public is both the ultimate beneficiary and an important supervisor of food safety. The government and enterprises should enhance public food safety awareness and identification capabilities through various forms of food safety public education. At the same time, channels for public participation in food safety governance should be streamlined, such as establishing a convenient food safety reporting platform to encourage public reporting of food safety violations, with appropriate rewards for effective reports. Widespread public participation can not only form a powerful social supervision force but also promote the government and enterprises to continuously improve food safety management levels.</p>

            <h3>III. From "Single Dimension" to "Multidimensional": Building an Integrated Development Model of Food Safety and Healthy Cities</h3>
            <p>Food safety is not only an important part of urban governance but also closely related to the health of the people. Therefore, the creation of food safety cities should be organically combined with healthy city creation, building an integrated development model of food safety and healthy cities.</p>
            <h4>3.1 New Model of "Food Safety + Cultural Tourism"</h4>
            <p>Combining local specialty food culture, creating food safety demonstration blocks or restaurants, promoting safe and healthy food consumption concepts, and attracting tourists to experience the organic combination of food safety and culture. For example, by promoting food safety certified local specialty foods, the safety of the food can be improved while also promoting local economic development, forming a virtuous interaction between food safety and cultural tourism.</p>
            <h4>3.2 New Experience of "Food Safety + Transparent Consumption"</h4>
            <p>Promoting the "Open Kitchen" project, through real-time livestreaming or transparent glass displays, allows consumers to witness the kitchen operations of catering enterprises, enhancing their知情权 and supervision rights, and increasing the transparency of food safety management. For example, by making the food processing process transparent, consumers can directly understand the production process of the food, increasing their trust in food safety. This not only enhances consumer experience but also pressures enterprises to improve their food safety management levels.</p>
            <h4>3.3 New Platform of "Food Safety + Health Education"</h4>
            <p>Combining schools, communities, and other venues, conducting food safety public education activities to enhance the public's food safety literacy and health awareness, fostering a good social atmosphere of caring for food safety. For example, through various forms of public education activities, such as food safety lectures, food safety knowledge competitions, and other activities, public awareness of food safety can be raised, increasing self-protection awareness. Through multidimensional and holistic integrated development, food safety can become a new business card for urban development, enhancing urban quality and residents' happiness.</p>
