            <h3>1. Digital Twin Transportation: An Intelligent and Digitalized Transportation Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>Digital twin transportation accurately replicates the physical world's transportation system in the digital world, utilizing big data, artificial intelligence, IoT, and other technologies to achieve real-time monitoring, analysis, and prediction of the transportation system. Its core lies in "omni-sensing, precise prediction, and intelligent regulation," optimizing traffic flow, reducing energy consumption, and emissions through comprehensive and multi-dimensional sensing and analysis.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Omni-Sensing</strong>: Employing sensors, cameras, radars, and other devices on roads to collect data in real-time, such as traffic flow, road conditions, and weather, to build an "omni-sensing" traffic brain.</li>
                <li><strong>Precise Prediction</strong>: Based on historical and real-time data, machine learning algorithms predict traffic flow accurately, preemptively identifying congestion hotspots and providing decision support for traffic management.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Regulation</strong>: Through vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle communication, vehicles are guided to travel safely, efficiently, and energy-savingly. The gradual implementation of autonomous driving technology will further enhance traffic efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and emissions.</li>
            </ul>
