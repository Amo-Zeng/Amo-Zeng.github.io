            <h3>Nature: The Cradle of Convergence and Innovation</h3>
            <p>Nature is the cradle of all things' convergence and the source of innovative thinking. In the first article, it mentions that plants connect through their roots, forming a vast underground network that shares nutrients and information, jointly resisting external invasions. This cooperative and win-win model showcases the most basic survival law of nature and inspires the cooperative spirit in human society. In the second article, it mentions that ants build complex social structures through pheromone communication, with clear division of labor and astonishing efficiency. This inspires us that in today's fast-developing technology, we need to break down information barriers and establish efficient communication mechanisms to achieve true collaborative innovation.</p>

            <h3>Human Civilization: The Driving Force of Convergence and Innovation</h3>
            <p>The progress of human civilization also relies on convergence and innovation. In the third article, it mentions that the "harmonious unity" thought in traditional Chinese culture emphasizes the exchange and collision between different cultures, ultimately achieving convergence and innovation. This thought has significant practical significance for today's world. Under the background of globalization, exchanges between different cultures are becoming more frequent. Only by adopting an open and inclusive attitude can we spark new ideas in collision and promote the continuous development of human civilization.</p>

            <h2>Ibsen: Multidimensional Exploration of Modernity, Cultural Integration, and Stage Art</h2>
            <p>In the vast literary universe, Henrik Ibsen, with his profound thoughts and unique artistic style, became the founding father of modern drama. His works not only broke the shackles of traditional drama but also infused theatrical art with new vitality through his strong modern elements. Ibsen's drama is not only a deep exploration of individual freedom, social critique, psychological depth, moral confusion, and reality reflection but also a timeless artistic charm across space and time.</p>

            <h3>Exploration of Modernity: Ibsen's Social Critique and Psychological Depth</h3>
            <p>Ibsen's modernity is first reflected in his deep concern for individual freedom. In "A Doll's House," Nora's transformation from a family doll to her eventual awakening and choice to leave her husband and children to bravely pursue her own self is a strong call for individual freedom. Through Nora's awakening, Ibsen reveals the contradictions between the individual and family and society in modern society, as well as the difficulty and necessity of pursuing freedom.</p>

            <h3>Perspective of Cultural Integration: Ibsen and Modern Chinese Theater</h3>
            <p>In 1918, Lu Xun's "The Ibsenism" was published in "New Youth,"震动震撼了整个中国文化界. This article not only represents Chinese intellectuals' admiration for Ibsen's drama but also opens a deep dialogue between Chinese theater art and Western modern drama. In this cross-cultural encounter between East and West, Ibsen's Nora became the most dazzling symbol on the modern Chinese theater stage and a symbol of Chinese women's pursuit of independent personality.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Ibsen's drama, from the exploration of modernity, to the perspective of cultural integration, and then to the multidimensional interpretation of stage art, showcases a harmonious and progressive world of diversity. His works not only deeply explore individual freedom, social critique, psychological depth, moral confusion, and reality reflection but also possess a timeless artistic charm.
