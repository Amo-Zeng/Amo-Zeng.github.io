            <p>When art no longer resides within a frame or pedestal, when creation is no longer the work of a single subject, and when memory no longer depends on stone tablets or archives, we are forced to ask: <strong>is it still an artwork?</strong> In today’s era, where digital technologies deeply infiltrate artistic practice, artworks have long surpassed the realm of static aesthetic objects, evolving into dynamic, participatory, and even self-evolving entities. They are no longer the pure crystallization of a "creator's will," nor passive vessels of cultural memory, nor mere objects of observation—they are increasingly becoming <strong>algorithmically co-produced entities, anti-monumental ephemera, and co-evolving cognitive interfaces</strong>. These three trajectories do not run in isolation but form a spiraling network of critical thought: from the algorithmicization of creation, to the destabilization of cultural meaning, and ultimately, to the neural reconstruction of cognition. Together, they point to a fundamental proposition—<strong>the contemporaneity of artworks is undergoing a triple reconfiguration</strong>.</p>

            <h2>I. The Transformation of Subjectivity: The "Post-Author" Ghost in Algorithmic Collaboration</h2>
            <p>In traditional art, "the death of the author" (Barthes) was once seen as a declaration of liberation. Today, the author is not only "dead," but has been <strong>parasitized</strong> by algorithmic collaboration. AI-generated art, such as Refik Anadol’s <em>Machine Hallucinations</em>, is not "created" by humans but "generated" by neural networks trained on massive datasets, producing visual dreams in latent space. Here, the author is no longer the creator, but the <strong>curator of data, the tuner of models, and the selector of outputs</strong>. Subjectivity does not vanish—it becomes <strong>distributed</strong> across the entanglement of humans and algorithms.</p>
            <p>This resonates with the core insight of posthumanism: subjectivity is no longer the exclusive privilege of humans, but a <strong>co-constructed process across species, media, and intelligences</strong>. Donna Haraway’s "cyborg" is no longer merely a metaphor, but a reality in art production—humans and algorithms together form a "creative subject," a <strong>non-dualistic, non-centralized, non-intentional</strong> "post-author." This subjectivity is not lost, but <strong>diluted</strong>, reconfigured as a relational existence. As media philosopher Friedrich Kittler stated: "Media determine our situation." When algorithms become the medium of creation, subjectivity is no longer "I think" (cogito), but "I calculate" (calculo)—a <strong>techno-cognitive hybrid</strong> that evolves within data streams and feedback loops.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>II. The Resistance of Memory: The "Politics of Ephemerality" in Anti-Monuments</h2>
            <p>If algorithms reconfigure the creative subject, then the <strong>ephemerality</strong> of digital art challenges the fixed logic of cultural memory. Traditional monuments—made of stone, permanent, and centralized in narrative—seek to freeze history into authoritative discourse. Contemporary art, however, employs "self-destruction" as a strategy, enacting a <strong>resistance to monumentality</strong>.</p>
            <p>The sharpest example is artist <strong>Kevin Abosch</strong>'s 2021 NFT work <em>IAMA COIN</em>, which was programmed with a "self-destruction protocol"—once sold, its digital file would be permanently erased from the blockchain. This is not a negation of value, but a provocation against the <strong>commodification of memory</strong>. NFTs are designed to affirm "ownership," yet this work completes its meaning through "destruction": <strong>only in disappearance does memory truly belong to the public sphere</strong>. It is no longer "possessed," but "experienced"; no longer "preserved," but "revisited."</p>
            <p>This echoes Paul Ricoeur’s theory of "narrative memory": memory is not archival storage, but a <strong>continuous practice of retelling</strong>. The self-destruction of digital art liberates memory from the authority of monuments, transforming it into a <strong>fluid, participatory, and decentralized cultural practice</strong>. It refuses to be archived, deified, or capitalized upon. As Giorgio Agamben said: "True memory is that which is not remembered."—In the digital flood, <strong>ephemerality itself becomes a political stance against memory monopolization</strong>.</p>

            <h2>III. The Leap of Cognition: The "Cognitive Interface" in the Fracture of Perception</h2>
            <p>As subjectivity is diluted by algorithms and memory is restructured by ephemerality, art’s function no longer ends at "seeing" or "remembering," but ascends to a <strong>cognitive interface</strong>—a <strong>co-thinking apparatus</strong> connecting human perception with external intelligent systems.</p>
            <p>The most revolutionary example is <strong>brain-computer interface (BCI) art</strong>. In 2023, artist <strong>Neri Oxman</strong> collaborated with neuroscientists to create <em>Neural Canvas</em>, using EEG devices to capture viewers’ brainwaves in real time, driving generative AI to produce dynamic images. Here, art is no longer "seen," but "thought"—the viewer’s neural activity directly becomes a creative parameter. Perception and cognition, inner and outer, neural and algorithmic, achieve <strong>real-time co-creation</strong>. This is no longer "human-machine interaction," but <strong>human-machine co-thinking</strong>.</p>
            <p>The cognitive science theory of "extended mind" finds artistic validation here: the mind does not reside solely in the brain, but extends outward through technological media. When neural signals are transformed into images, art becomes an <strong>exosomatic organ of cognition</strong>—not reflecting thought, but <strong>participating in its generation</strong>. This overturns Kantian "transcendental cognition," pointing toward a new paradigm of cognition—<strong>embodied, technological, and environmentally coupled</strong>. Art thus shifts from "aesthetic object" to "cognitive infrastructure."</p>

            <h2>IV. The Philosophical Intertextuality of the Triple Variation: From Posthumanism to Cognitive Ecology</h2>
            <p>The three trajectories—algorithmic collaboration, anti-monumentality, and cognitive interface—are not parallel, but form a <strong>spiraling structure of critical thought</strong>. They share a common philosophical foundation: <strong>the thorough deconstruction of anthropocentrism</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In <strong>algorithmic collaboration</strong>, subjectivity is diluted by posthumanism—humans are no longer the sole intelligences;</li>
                <li>In <strong>anti-monumentality</strong>, memory is restructured by media philosophy—history is no longer the monologue of stone;</li>
                <li>In <strong>cognitive interface</strong>, cognition is expanded by cognitive science—thinking is no longer a closed theater within the skull.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Together, they point toward a vision of <strong>cognitive ecology</strong>: art is no longer isolated from society, but embedded in complex networks of technology, memory, and cognition. It is both a <strong>mediator of technology</strong>, a <strong>resister of memory</strong>, and a <strong>co-thinker of thought</strong>. This triple variation is the <strong>meta-paradigm</strong> of contemporary art—no longer asking "what is art?" but "how does art reconfigure our relationship with the world?"</p>
            <p>Deeper still, these three form a <strong>paradoxical symbiosis</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Algorithmic collaboration <strong>dissolves</strong> the author, yet <strong>generates</strong> a more complex creative subject;</li>
                <li>Anti-monumentality <strong>denies</strong> permanence, yet <strong>activates</strong> a more authentic politics of memory;</li>
                <li>Cognitive interface <strong>externalizes</strong> thought, yet <strong>deepens</strong> the subject’s sense of existence.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is the true power of contemporary art: it does not seek stability, but embraces <strong>uncertain generation</strong>; it does not cling to form, but explores <strong>revolutionary function</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: The Ultimate Paradox—When Art Is No Longer "Seen," Can It Still Be "Thought"?</h2>
            <p>We stand at a cognitive singularity: art no longer needs to be "seen," but can be "thought"; no longer needs to be "preserved," but can be "co-created"; no longer needs to be "interpreted," but can be "participated in." Yet, in this process, a fundamental <strong>cognitive paradox</strong> emerges:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>When art becomes a cognitive interface, when the artwork and thought co-generate in real time, can we still distinguish between "art" and "cognition"? When algorithms, neural signals, and blockchain together form the creative system, has art ceased to be a "work" and become a "process" itself?</strong></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Further: if art’s function is to reconfigure cognition, then when it succeeds, does it <strong>self-abolish</strong>?—Just as anti-monuments become new forms of memory through resistance, cognitive interfaces blur the boundaries of art through co-creation.</p>
            <p>This may be the deepest fate of contemporary art: it does not seek eternity, but <strong>continuous self-negation through reconfiguration</strong>; it does not define itself, but through each technological intervention, each act of memory resistance, and each cognitive co-creation, <strong>re-asks "what is art?"</strong></p>
            <p>Thus, the ultimate question is no longer "what is art?" but:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>When art no longer exists as an "object," does it not, in fact, more authentically reveal—who we are, and how we think?</strong></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Within the undercurrents of algorithms, in the ashes of memory, and in the tremors of neurons, contemporary art, through its triple variation, is sounding a <strong>cognitive revolution</strong> about existence, memory, and thought. This is its true mission in the digital age—not to provide answers, but to <strong>constantly open new questions</strong>.</p>
