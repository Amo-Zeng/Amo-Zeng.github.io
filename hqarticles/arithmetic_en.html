            <h2>Data Bias and Algorithmic Fairness</h2>
            <p>Data bias is one of the main reasons for algorithmic unfairness. The training data of algorithms often reflects historical inequalities and biases. For example, crime prediction algorithms may unfairly target certain communities due to historical racial biases. This bias not only affects individuals but can also exacerbate social inequalities.</p>
            <p>To reduce data bias, researchers have proposed various methods such as data debiasing, algorithm debiasing, and fairness metrics. Data debiasing aims to clean up biases in training data, while algorithm debiasing adjusts algorithm parameters to reduce bias. Fairness metrics are used to evaluate the fairness of algorithms, such as statistical bias and equal opportunity gaps. However, these methods still face challenges in practical applications, especially in complex social systems where the definition and evaluation criteria for fairness are diverse and controversial.</p>
