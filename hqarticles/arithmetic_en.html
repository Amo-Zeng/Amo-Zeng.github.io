            <h2>The Collision of Algorithms and Humanity: The Interplay of Technological Rationality and Human Sentiment</h2>
            <p>In the digital age, algorithms have become an integral part of our lives. They recommend information in search engines, shape our social networks on social media, determine investment strategies in financial markets, and even assist in diagnosis in the medical field. However, with the widespread application of algorithms, the clash between technological rationality and human sentiment has increasingly come to the fore. This collision not only changes human behavioral patterns and decision-making methods but also poses profound challenges to our values and ethical standards.</p>

            <h3>The Roots of Algorithmic Bias</h3>
            <p>The core of algorithms lies in data processing and pattern recognition, yet their outcomes inevitably bear the biases of human society. Algorithmic bias does not arise from malicious intent but from the limitations of design and data. For example, the accuracy differences in facial recognition technology across different races expose the racial bias in training datasets; the preferences of hiring algorithms for certain genders or educational backgrounds reflect the inherent social biases of gender and class.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Bias:</strong> Algorithms rely on historical data for learning and prediction, which often reflects the structural inequalities of human society.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithm Design Bias:</strong> Algorithm designers may unintentionally embed their own biases into the logic of the algorithm.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Core Issues of Algorithmic Dependency</h3>
            <p>As the precision and efficiency of algorithms continue to improve, human reliance on them deepens. This dependency manifests not only in daily life but also in decision-making processes. For instance, the popularity of autonomous vehicles fosters a high level of trust in machine judgment, while content recommendations on social media platforms trap us in "filter bubbles," making it difficult to access diverse perspectives.</p>
            <p><strong>The core issue of algorithmic dependency</strong> is: <strong>Can humans maintain sufficient autonomy and critical thinking when faced with complex decisions?</strong></p>

        <section>
            <h3>Algorithmic Ethics Dilemmas</h3>
            <p>Algorithms often face complex ethical dilemmas when dealing with significant issues such as human life, freedom, and privacy. Should autonomous vehicles prioritize protecting passengers or pedestrians in the event of an accident? How should social media platforms balance freedom of speech with the spread of misinformation? The answers to these questions not only relate to the application boundaries of technology but also to the values and ethical standards of human society.</p>

            <h2>The Story Behind Algorithms: The Fusion of Science and Humanities</h2>
            <p>The inventors of algorithms are often scientific giants whose creativity and wisdom not only drive scientific progress but also profoundly influence human lifestyles and thinking patterns.</p>
            <h3>Alan Turing</h3>
            <p>Alan Turing is one of the founding fathers of computer science. He proposed the concept of the "Turing machine," a theoretical computational model that later became the basis of modern computers. The Turing machine, with its simple yet powerful computing capabilities, laid the foundation for modern algorithms.</p>
            <h3>John von Neumann</h3>
            <p>John von Neumann is another pioneer in computer science. In 1945, he proposed the "von Neumann architecture," which became the foundation of modern computers. Von Neumann was not only an outstanding mathematician and computer scientist but also a versatile scientist who made significant contributions in quantum mechanics, fluid dynamics, and game theory.</p>
