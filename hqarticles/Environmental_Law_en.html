            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Under the theoretical framework of the "Risk Society" proposed by Beck (1992), paradigm breakthroughs in digital revolution and biotechnology are generating a "dual deconstruction effect": dissolving the established "technology-law" boundary cognition in modern environmental law while disturbing the spatiotemporal coordinate system of traditional ecological ethics...</p>

            <h2>I. Digital Governance Evolution: Environmental Element Rights Revolution and Governance Efficacy Restructuring</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Quantum Entitlement Mechanism for Environmental Rights</h3>
            <p>According to the "Algorithmic Empowerment" theory proposed by Fisch et al. (2023), when carbon accounting parameters are embedded in smart contract code layers, individual behaviors generating environmental positive/negative externalities are transformed in real-time into tradable digital assets (NTF-Carbon)...</p>
            
            <h3>1.2 Topological Restructuring of Regulatory Power</h3>
            <p>Digital governance no longer represents a simple extension of Foucauldian panopticism, but evolves into a topological network of state actors-smart contracts-DAO communities...</p>
            
            <h3>1.3 Algorithmic Implementation Mechanism for Value Balancing</h3>
            <p>Aligning with Lessig's (2006) proposition of "Code is Law", the privacy compliance algorithm established by the German Federal Court in the "Connected Vehicle Data Case" (BGH XII ZR 403/21) transcends passive compliance frameworks...</p>

            <h2>II. Technological Risk Restructuring: Temporal Scale Disruption and Spatial Dispersion Regulation</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Reverse Engineering of Technology Control Parameters</h3>
            <p>The "Three-Tier Failure Mechanism" established by the EU's Daedalus Act essentially operationalizes Jonas' (1984) ethics of responsibility through technological transformation...</p>
            
            <h3>2.2 Dynamic Adaptive Framework for Liability Systems</h3>
            <p>Bayer AG's Centennial Liability Trust Mechanism dynamically adjusts reserve curves through parameterized Risk Distribution Functions (RDF)...</p>
            
            <h3>2.3 Elastic Response Framework for Tech Ethics</h3>
            <p>The "Dual Scientific Standard" liability rule established in FFA v. Biotech Corp (9th Cir. 2022)...</p>
