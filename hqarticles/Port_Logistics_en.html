            <h2>Triple Revolution in Power, Human Resources, and Finance of Ports Under Supply Chain Transformation</h2>
            <h3>Introduction: Triple Revolution in Ports Amid Global Supply Chain Transformation</h3>
            <p>As global supply chains shift from "efficiency-first" to "resilience-first," the traditional role of ports as logistics nodes is undergoing fundamental changes. Vietnam's Haiphong Port is restructuring industrial chain power through data alliances, India's Mundra Port achieves geopolitical arbitrage via multimodal transport networks, while Rotterdam Port in the Netherlands is reshaping financial logic with climate bonds... These cases reveal a systemic revolution involving power structures, human resources, and financial mechanisms.</p>
