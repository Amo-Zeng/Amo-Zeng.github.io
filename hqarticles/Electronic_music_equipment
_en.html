The term "数甲" (shù jiǎ) typically refers to "Math Level A," an advanced mathematics course in some high school curricula. For precise translation, please provide the full context or sentence you want to translate. Examples:  
- 学校开设数甲课程 → Schools offer Math Level A courses.  
- 他选修数甲 → He elected to take Advanced Mathematics.  

If you meant "数学" (shù xué) instead:
