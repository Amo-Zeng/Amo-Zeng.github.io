            <h2>Data Scientist: The "Alchemist" of the Digital Age and Shaper of Future Society</h2>
            <p>Throughout human history, alchemists were a group shrouded in mystery, attempting to transform base metals into precious metals through complex experiments and rituals. Though their efforts were ultimately proven futile by science, these experiments laid the foundation for the development of modern chemistry. In today's digital age, data scientists are performing a similar "alchemy" in a modern form. By collecting, cleaning, modeling, and analyzing data, they transform seemingly disordered numbers into "digital gold" that drives decision-making and creates value. Data scientists are not just practitioners of technology but also "alchemists" of the new era, using wisdom and creativity to turn data into a powerful force for social progress.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>I. From "Turning Lead into Gold" to "Transforming Data into Value"</h3>
            <p>Historically, alchemists sought to turn ordinary metals into gold through complex chemical and physical experiments. However, scientific advancements revealed the essence of matter, proving this goal unattainable. Although alchemists failed to achieve their ultimate dream, their experiments paved the way for modern chemistry. In contrast, the goal of data scientists is not to convert data into physical wealth but to transform data into profound insights that guide business decisions, improve efficiency, and even change industries through analysis and modeling.</p>
            <p>Data scientists begin with processing complex, large-scale data, which may come from social media, sensors, transaction records, or experimental data, appearing chaotic at first glance. Like alchemists, data scientists must first "purify" this raw data through careful preparation and processing. In this process, noise is eliminated, outliers are removed, and structured information is extracted. This "data cleaning" process is the modern equivalent of the alchemical practice of "purifying substances." Next, data scientists use tools such as statistics and machine learning to analyze and model the data, seeking patterns and regularities within it. Similar to the alchemist's pursuit of element transformation in experiments, data scientists attempt to convert data into actionable insights through algorithms.</p>
            <p>However, the challenges and limitations faced by data scientists are somewhat analogous to those of alchemists. First, the quality and quantity of data determine the accuracy of the final analysis results. Like alchemists relying on the purity of experimental materials, data scientists must also depend on high-quality data; otherwise, the "alchemy" will fail. Second, the selection and tuning of models are crucial, as different algorithms and parameters can lead to vastly different results. Furthermore, data scientists' "alchemy" does not always guarantee success; models may fail to capture the complexity of the data or perform poorly in practical applications, similar to the failures faced by alchemists.</p>
