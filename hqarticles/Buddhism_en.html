        <h1>Buddhism as a Meta-Cognitive and Ethical Operating System for the 21st Century</h1>
        <h2>— Reconstructing Subjectivity, Understanding, and Ethical Agency Amid Digital Alienation, Post-Truth, and Systemic Crisis</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <p>In the triple convergence of technological acceleration, information explosion, and global crises, humanity faces an unprecedented <strong>modern cognitive and ethical crisis</strong>: we are defined by digital identities, manipulated by emotionalized narratives, and ensnared by invisible structural violence. Technology, meant to expand freedom, has become a new form of alienation; information, meant to lead to truth, has become a weapon in cognitive warfare; society, meant to uphold justice, is mired in invisible causal entanglements. Confronted with this "triple alienation," dominant Western paradigms—techno-optimism, liberal individualism, and rationalist epistemology—have all shown their limits. Yet in this context, Buddhist philosophy, with its profound insights into <strong>non-self (anattā), dependent origination (paṭiccasamuppāda), and karma (karma)</strong>, is quietly emerging as a <strong>non-Western, non-techno-deterministic, non-individualistic meta-cognitive and ethical operating system</strong>. It not only diagnoses the deep pathologies of modernity but also offers a <strong>holistic response framework</strong>—from cognition to understanding to action.</p>

            <p>This article argues: <strong>the core value of Buddhist philosophy in the 21st century lies precisely in its function as a "meta-operating system"—not providing direct technologies or policies, but reconstructing the foundational logic through which we understand the world, locate ourselves, and assume responsibility</strong>. This system consists of three interdependent modules: <strong>"non-self" to counter digital identity alienation and rebuild subjectivity; "dependent origination and emptiness" to dismantle post-truth cognitive paralysis and reconstruct understanding; and "systemic karma" to reframe causal ethics and rebuild moral agency</strong>. These three layers progress from cognitive awakening, to deepened understanding, to ethical practice, together forming a <strong>Buddhist critique of modernity</strong>—offering a non-alienated path of human existence in the digital age, ecological crisis, and cognitive disarray.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>I. Non-Self: Rebuilding Subjectivity from the Digital Cage</h2>
            <p>We live in an era defined by data. Social media reduces "the self" to likes, followers, and algorithmic profiles; platform economies reify the self as consumer tags, attention commodities, and behavioral data streams. This <strong>digital identity alienation</strong> distorts self-perception and fundamentally undermines agency and dignity—we are no longer "actors," but "respondents shaped by algorithms."</p>
            <p>Buddhism's doctrine of <strong>non-self (anattā)</strong> does not deny existence but reveals that the "self" is not a fixed, independent, or substantial entity, but a transient aggregate of the five aggregates (form, sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness) in constant flux through dependent conditions. In the digital age, this insight is revolutionary: <strong>when platforms claim "this is who you are," non-self reminds us: there is no 'you'—only 'how you are constructed'</strong>. Every click, every pause, every emotional fluctuation participates in the temporary generation of "self." Algorithms capture these moments, solidifying the fluid "non-self" into static labels, thus enabling control over human beings.</p>
            <p>Non-self thus becomes a <strong>cognitive vaccine</strong> against digital alienation. It does not reject data but refuses to be defined by it; it does not flee platforms but resists internalizing their logic. Through mindfulness, we can recognize during video scrolling: "This is not me, only a temporary manifestation of desire"; in social anxiety: "This is not me, only a conditioned habit of comparison." This <strong>decentered awareness</strong> allows the subject to step back from algorithmic automation, restoring <strong>the freedom of choice</strong>—not by rejecting technology, but by refusing technological colonization.</p>
            <p>More importantly, non-self provides the <strong>subjective foundation</strong> for the next module: "dependent origination and emptiness." Without deep recognition of the self's illusoriness, we cannot truly grasp "all phenomena are empty of self-nature"; without loosening attachment to the ego, we cannot release the fixation on "absolute truth." <strong>Non-self is the gateway to emptiness, the starting point of cognitive liberation</strong>. In the digital age, it is not a passive philosophy of escapism, but a <strong>wakeful resistance</strong>: in the flood of data, preserving the absence of "I" is precisely to protect the presence of "human."</p>

        <section>
            <h2>II. Dependent Origination and Emptiness: Reconstructing Understanding in the Fog of Post-Truth</h2>
            <p>Having deconstructed the substantiality of the self, "dependent origination and emptiness" further deconstructs the substantiality of the world. The core crisis of the post-truth era is not a lack of information, but the <strong>collapse of cognitive frameworks</strong>: we no longer believe in "truth," only in "positions"; we no longer seek "understanding," only "resonance." Algorithmic feeds, emotionalized narratives, and echo chambers on social media swallow "facts" into "meaning," replacing "evidence" with "belief." We enter a state of <strong>cognitive paralysis</strong>: the more we know, the less we understand.</p>
            <p>Buddhism's <strong>dependent origination (paṭiccasamuppāda)</strong> teaches that all phenomena arise from interdependent conditions and lack independent self-nature; <strong>emptiness (śūnyatā)</strong> further reveals that because of dependent origination, all things are empty of inherent existence. This is not nihilism, but a <strong>dynamic, relational ontology</strong>: the world is not composed of "substances" but of "relations"; events are not determined by "single causes" but by "multiple interwoven conditions."</p>
            <blockquote>
                - <strong>There are no "pure facts"</strong>: every "fact" is embedded in specific contexts, perspectives, interests, and narrative structures—a temporary manifestation of dependent conditions;<br>
                - <strong>There is no "absolute truth"</strong>: so-called "truth" is only a temporary consensus from a particular viewpoint, not an eternal, unchanging essence;<br>
                - <strong>There are no "independent events"</strong>: every social event (war, pandemic, election) is the result of countless individual, institutional, historical, and cultural conditions—never reducible to "someone said," "a party did," or "a country is evil."
            </blockquote>
            <p>This "cognitive emptiness" liberates us from fixation on "who is right and who is wrong," shifting toward "<strong>how to understand</strong>"—understanding complexity, the mechanisms behind positions, and the construction of narratives. It encourages us to move beyond "either/or" binaries into "<strong>both/and</strong>" dialectical thinking. For example, in the Russia-Ukraine war, instead of choosing between "justice vs. aggression," we might ask: What historical conditions led to this conflict? What structural pressures trap both sides in zero-sum logic? What discursive mechanisms amplify polarization?</p>
            <p>"Dependent origination and emptiness" is thus not just philosophy, but a <strong>cognitive practice</strong>. It requires:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Suspending judgment</strong>: refrain from taking sides until conditions are fully understood;</li>
                <li><strong>Tracing context</strong>: inquire into the multiple causes behind phenomena;</li>
                <li><strong>Reflecting on perspective</strong>: examine the limitations and biases of one's own cognition.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This reconstruction of understanding depends precisely on the prior completion of "non-self"—<strong>only when the "I" no longer clings to its own view can we see the full picture of dependent origination</strong>. Without non-self, "dependent origination" is still distorted by egoic fixation into "the truth I see."</p>

        <section>
            <h2>III. Systemic Karma: Reconstructing Ethical Responsibility Amid Structural Violence</h2>
            <p>When non-self liberates the subject, and dependent origination expands understanding, Buddhism's <strong>karma (karma)</strong> points toward <strong>ethical action</strong>. Traditional karma is often misunderstood as "individual moral retribution," but in the modern context, we must elevate it to "<strong>systemic karma</strong>"—the <strong>chain-like, delayed, and asymmetrical consequences</strong> of individual actions within complex social systems.</p>
            <p>Ecological crisis, economic inequality, algorithmic bias, war violence—none of these are "someone's fault" alone, but the <strong>long-term accumulation of countless small choices, institutional inertia, and technological pathways within a web of conditions</strong>. Each of us participates in <strong>collective karma (sādhāraṇa-karma)</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consumers choosing fast fashion participate in global exploitation chains;</li>
                <li>Users clicking on hate content reinforce algorithmic bias;</li>
                <li>Citizens remaining silent in the face of injustice condone systemic violence.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>"Systemic karma" reminds us: <strong>responsibility is not "who is to blame," but "how I participate"</strong>. It does not deny structural power, but refuses to externalize responsibility entirely. Buddhist karma is not fate, but a <strong>dynamic, transformable process</strong>—every present choice reshapes future conditions. Deforestation is karma, but refusing to buy illegally harvested wood is also karma; sharing inflammatory speech is karma, but reporting misinformation is also karma.</p>
            <p>"Systemic karma" thus offers a <strong>non-individualistic, non-deterministic ethics of action</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Acknowledge structural constraints</strong>: we are not free, but still have agency;</li>
                <li><strong>Recognize personal participation</strong>: even small, my actions affect the system;</li>
                <li><strong>Actively transform conditions</strong>: through mindfulness, empathy, and institutional innovation, break vicious cycles.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For example, in the climate crisis, we need not wait for global treaties, but can act on specific conditions: "reduce carbon footprint," "support green policies," "join community initiatives"—gradually reshaping the system. This "<strong>micro-karma intervention</strong>" is the modern practice of Buddhist ethics.</p>
            <p>The possibility of "systemic karma" rests precisely on the framework of "dependent origination": <strong>only by understanding the world as relational, dynamic, and non-substantial can we see how "small actions" might leverage "large systems"</strong>. Without dependent origination, karma becomes mechanical retribution; without non-self, we cannot release the despair of "nothing I do matters," abandoning action.</p>

            <h2>IV. A Buddhist Critique of Modernity: A Non-Western Path for Civilization</h2>
            <p>The three principles—<strong>non-self, dependent origination and emptiness, systemic karma</strong>—are not isolated doctrines, but a <strong>coherent operating system</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Non-self is the <strong>subject module</strong>, deconstructing digital alienation and rebuilding cognitive freedom;</li>
                <li>Dependent origination and emptiness is the <strong>understanding module</strong>, dismantling post-truth and expanding cognitive depth;</li>
                <li>Systemic karma is the <strong>ethical module</strong>, reframing responsibility and guiding transformative action.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Together, they form a <strong>Buddhist critique of modernity</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It critiques techno-determinism, asserting <strong>technology is condition, not destiny</strong>;</li>
                <li>It critiques individualism, asserting <strong>responsibility is collective karma, not sole blame</strong>;</li>
                <li>It critiques Western rationalism, asserting <strong>understanding is relational, not substantial</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At a time when human civilization faces digital totalitarianism, ecological collapse, and cognitive fragmentation, Buddhist thought offers a <strong>non-Western, non-techno, non-anthropocentric path of reflection</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It does not rely on "more advanced algorithms" or "stronger regulation," but calls for <strong>a fundamental shift in cognitive paradigm</strong>;</li>
                <li>It does not seek to "control nature" or "conquer others," but advocates <strong>wisdom of coexistence through dependent origination</strong>;</li>
                <li>It does not place hope in "saviors" or "final solutions," but emphasizes <strong>each moment of awareness and choice</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is a <strong>sustainable civilizational operating system</strong>: it does not promise utopia, but offers the capacity to remain wakeful in crisis, understanding in chaos, and active in despair. It teaches: <strong>true freedom is not escape from systems, but non-attachment within them; true responsibility is not changing the world, but not becoming a condition of harm</strong>.</p>
            <p>In the flood of data, we may not stop algorithmic control, but we can choose not to be defined by it; in the fog of information, we may not find absolute truth, but we can choose not to be carried away by emotion; in systemic violence, we may not instantly change structures, but we can choose not to replicate them.</p>
            <p>Buddhism, as an ancient wisdom, is re-emerging in a new form as a <strong>meta-cognitive and ethical operating system for the 21st century</strong>—not replacing science, but correcting its blind spots; not rejecting technology, but guarding its human boundaries; not fleeing modernity, but offering its redemption.</p>
            <p>At the crossroads of human civilization, we do not need more technology, but deeper wisdom. And this path of wisdom may begin with an ancient reminder: <strong>non-self, dependent origination, karma can be transformed</strong>.</p>
