            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Transcriptomics, as a discipline studying gene expression, has evolved from merely describing gene expression levels to becoming an essential "metadata" for understanding the complexity of biological systems, thanks to the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies. Transcriptomic data not only reveal dynamic changes in gene expression but also correlate with other omics data such as genomics, epigenomics, and proteomics, constructing more comprehensive biological system models. This article explores the applications of transcriptomics from multiple dimensions, including its role as "metadata," dynamic changes under time resolution, and its applications in precision medicine, showcasing its profound implications and broad prospects in biomedical research.</p>

            <h3>Transcriptomics as "Metadata"</h3>
            <p>Transcriptomic data plays the role of "metadata" in the study of biological systems, providing a novel perspective on understanding the complex mechanisms of gene expression regulation through integrated analysis with genomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Correlation of Transcriptomics with Genomic Data:</strong> Genomic data provides static information about genes, while transcriptomic data reveals dynamic changes in gene expression.</li>
                <li><strong>Correlation of Transcriptomics with Epigenomic Data:</strong> Epigenomics studies the epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression regulation, such as DNA methylation and histone modification.</li>
                <li><strong>Correlation of Transcriptomics with Proteomic Data:</strong> Proteomics studies the expression and function of proteins, while transcriptomic data provides information on gene expression.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrated Analysis of Multi-Omics Data:</strong> Transcriptomic data, as "metadata," can be integrated with genomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data to construct a more comprehensive biological system model.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Transcriptomics Under Time Resolution</h3>
            <p>Transcriptomics not only focuses on static changes in gene expression but also reveals dynamic changes in gene expression over time and space through improved time resolution, providing new insights into physiological and pathological processes of organisms.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Single-Cell Transcriptomics and Time Resolution:</strong> Single-cell transcriptomics technology can analyze dynamic changes in gene expression at the single-cell level.</li>
                <li><strong>Spatial Transcriptomics and Time Resolution:</strong> Spatial transcriptomics technology can analyze spatial distribution of gene expression at the tissue and cellular levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Application of Time-Series Transcriptomic Data:</strong> Time-series transcriptomic data can analyze dynamic changes in gene expression at different time scales.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Model Construction Based on Time Resolution:</strong> Based on time-resolved transcriptomic data, dynamic models of biological systems can be constructed to predict future gene expression patterns.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Transcriptomics-Driven Precision Medicine</h3>
            <p>Transcriptomic data plays a significant role not only in basic research but also in precision medicine. By correlating transcriptomic data with genomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data, disease risk prediction models tailored to individual patients can be developed, guiding the development of personalized drugs and the formulation of precision medical plans.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personalized Disease Risk Prediction:</strong> Using transcriptomic data, disease risk prediction models for individual patients can be developed.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized Tumor Immunotherapy:</strong> Based on transcriptomic data, personalized tumor immunotherapy plans can be developed.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep Learning and Discovery of Disease Biomarkers:</strong> Using deep learning algorithms, large-scale transcriptomic data can be analyzed to discover new disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Transcriptomics, as a discipline studying gene expression, has gained widespread attention and application in recent years. With the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, transcriptomic data is no longer merely a description of gene expression levels but has become essential "metadata" for understanding the complexity of biological systems. By correlating transcriptomic data with genomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data, more comprehensive biological system models can be constructed to deepen the understanding of gene expression regulation mechanisms. In the future, with the advancement of multi-omics data integration analysis technologies, transcriptomic data will play an increasingly important role in biomedical research.</p>
