            <h3>From "Observation" to "Manipulation": The Dual Revolution of Particle Detector Technology</h3>
            <p>The development of particle detectors is, in essence, a history of mankind's deepening understanding of the microscopic world. From early cloud chambers and bubble chambers to the CMS and ATLAS detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), particle detectors have evolved from mere "observation" tools to "bridges" that decode the quantum world and build the universe's map. By accurately measuring particle energy, momentum, charge, and other properties, they verify theoretical models, explore unknown fields, reveal the intrinsic mechanisms of particle interactions, and help us understand the origin, evolution, and structure of the universe.</p>
            <p>However, the mission of particle detectors does not stop here. With rapid technological advancements, they are shifting from "tracking" particle trajectories to "manipulating" particle behavior, initiating a dual revolution from "observation" to "manipulation." High-precision, high-sensitivity particle detector technology offers possibilities for breakthroughs in frontier fields such as quantum computing and quantum communication. The fragility of quantum bits makes them highly susceptible to interference, but particle detectors can monitor and correct errors in real-time, ensuring the reliability of quantum computing. In quantum communication, particle detectors can detect eavesdropping, providing real-time defense and ensuring the security of information transmission. Additionally, quantum sensors based on particle detector technology are leading a revolution in ultra-high-precision physical measurements, with applications ranging from biomagnetic field detection to environmental monitoring, offering limitless potential.</p>
