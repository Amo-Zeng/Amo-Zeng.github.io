            <h2>Surrealism: A Visual Revolution Across Boundaries</h2>
            <p>Surrealism, an artistic and literary movement initiated by André Breton in the early 20th century, is more than just a painting genre; it is a visual revolution that spans across art, literature, film, and other fields.

Surrealist works often lack clear plot development, replaced by juxtapositions of seemingly unrelated images and scenes. This non-linear narrative challenges the audience's habitual thinking, forcing them to interpret and understand the work from different angles. For instance, Magritte's "The Treachery of Images" uses the contradiction between the text "This is not a pipe" and the image to subvert the audience's perception of the relationship between images and reality.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, in color usage, Surrealist artists break traditional color rules.
