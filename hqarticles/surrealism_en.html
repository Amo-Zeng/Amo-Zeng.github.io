In China's college entrance examination system (the National Unified Examination for Admissions to General Colleges and Universities), "Math A" typically refers to the **science track mathematics paper** (also known as "Mathematics (Science)") in the Gaokao, while the humanities track mathematics paper is referred to as "Math B" (some provinces or regions may use different names). Below is a detailed explanation:

### 1. **Differences Between Math A (Science) and Math B (Humanities)**
- **Math A (Science)**:  
  - Targeted at science track students, it is more challenging and covers more advanced content.  
  - Includes all the foundational content of Math B, with additional topics such as:  
    - Calculus (derivatives, definite integrals)  
    - Advanced applications of spatial vectors and solid geometry  
    - Probability distributions and expectations in statistics  
    - Complex numbers and more intricate plane geometry problems, etc.  

- **Math B (Humanities)**:  
  - Targeted at humanities track students, it focuses on fundamentals and practical applications, with a lower difficulty level.  
  - Does not include topics exclusive to the science track, such as calculus and spatial vectors.

### 2. **Other Possible Meanings**
- **Shanghai Gaokao Mathematics Papers**:  
  Shanghai once divided its mathematics papers into "Math A" and "Math B" (prior to and including 2017), where "Math A" corresponded to the science track paper and "Math B" to the humanities track paper. However, since 2017, Shanghai has abolished the division between science and humanities tracks, and mathematics is now unified under a single paper.  
- **Competitions or Independent Admissions**:  
  Some schools' independent admissions exams or mathematics competitions may use "Math A" to refer to higher-difficulty mathematics questions. The specific context of the exam should be confirmed.

### 3. **Recommendations**  
If your question pertains to Gaokao preparation:  
- Confirm whether your province still divides the exam into science and humanities tracks.  
- Refer to the syllabus issued by the Ministry of Education or the local examination authority.  

If the context is different (e.g., competitions, textbooks, etc.), please provide additional details.
