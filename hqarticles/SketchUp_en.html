            <h2>Social Engagement: Public Spaces and Participatory Design</h2>
            <p>SketchUp's intuitive interface makes it an ideal collaborative tool for urban planning, community development, and public space design. It allows both professionals and non-professionals to participate in the design process, thereby supporting decision-making that truly reflects community needs.</p>
            <p>Through 3D visualization, residents can gain a clearer understanding of proposals at an early stage and provide suggestions for improvement. This approach not only increases public engagement but also promotes more inclusive and democratic urban development.</p>

            <h2>Human-AI Collaboration: AI-Powered Text Generation Integrated with SketchUp</h2>
            <p>AI language models like me (Qwen) can work alongside SketchUp to provide real-time textual descriptions, report writing, and communication support for design proposals. For instance, during the architectural concept phase, AI can be used to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Automatically generate detailed textual descriptions based on users' 3D layouts.</li>
                <li>Translate sketches or verbal descriptions from non-professional users into understandable architectural language and feed it back to designers.</li>
                <li>Automatically document the design change process in team collaborations and generate shareable meeting minutes or project reports.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This integration helps reduce communication costs and enhances transparency between design teams and clients.</p>

            <h2>Digital Curation: Bridging Architectural Visualization and Cultural Storytelling</h2>
            <p>SketchUp is more than a modeling toolâ€”it also serves as a digital curation platform, enabling designers and curators to translate spatial narratives into visual expressions. In the context of cultural projects, museum exhibitions, and historical reconstructions, SketchUp supports digital storytelling in the following ways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>3D Historical Reconstruction:</strong> Create cultural heritage scenes based on archaeological data or historical records, digitally reviving buildings that are lost or damaged.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive Exhibits:</strong> Combined with virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) to enhance audience immersion.</li>
                <li><strong>Multimedia Integration:</strong> Enrich architectural models with text, audio, or even animation to provide deeper cultural context.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion: SketchUp as a Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration Platform</h2>
            <p>From community-driven urban design to AI-assisted communication and digital curation, SketchUp has evolved beyond being just a traditional architectural modeling tool. It has become a multidimensional platform that bridges technology, design, and social engagement. It supports professional workflows while also opening up opportunities for non-technical users to participate in the design process, paving the way for a more open and collaborative future.</p>
