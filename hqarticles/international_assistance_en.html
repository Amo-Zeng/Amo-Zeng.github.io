            <h2>Building a New International Aid Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>The traditional international aid system has long faced severe challenges such as inefficiency, lack of transparency, and poor sustainability. However, driven by the global digital wave, emerging technologies like blockchain, skill training, and micro-aid are providing unprecedented opportunities for the transformation of international aid.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Part One: Blockchain – The Foundation for Trust and Efficiency</h3>
            <p>In the traditional international aid system, the flow of funds often requires multiple intermediaries, leading to inefficiency, high administrative costs, and difficulty in tracing the flow of funds. The advent of blockchain technology offers a revolutionary solution to these problems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decentralized Nature:</strong> Bypasses cumbersome intermediary steps, significantly enhancing the efficiency of fund transfers.</li>
                <li><strong>Distributed Ledger Technology:</strong> Ensures that every transaction is recorded on an immutable ledger.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> Automatically disburse seed and fertilizer subsidies, ensuring funds are used for their intended purposes.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Part Two: Skill Training – Teaching to Fish and Empowering Inner Drive</h3>
            <p>While traditional material and financial aid can alleviate the immediate困境 of recipient countries, it does not address poverty at its root. Skill training empowers the people of recipient countries by enhancing their self-development abilities, helping them acquire skills to escape poverty and realize their self-worth.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Agricultural Training:</strong> Improves agricultural productivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial Training:</strong> Enhances manufacturing levels and drives industrial transformation and upgrading.</li>
                <li><strong>Entrepreneurship Cultivation:</strong> Encourages self-employment and stimulates economic growth.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Part Three: Micro-Aid – The Microscopic Force of the Butterfly Effect and Social Change</h3>
            <p>Micro-aid may seem insignificant, yet it holds the power to change the world. Through forms such as entrepreneurial funds and skill training, micro-aid helps people gain the ability to sustain themselves, stimulating their inner drive.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Empowerment而非施舍:</strong> Promotes individual脱贫, injecting social vitality.</li>
                <li><strong>Chain Reaction:</strong> Encourages more people to participate in aid actions, creating a role model effect.</li>
                <li><strong>Information Sharing and Resource Integration:</strong> Generates greater social benefits and drives policy implementation.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Part Four: Building a New International Aid Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>Blockchain, skill training, and micro-aid interact and complement each other. The construction of this new international aid ecosystem not only enhances the efficiency and transparency of aid but also truly achieves the goal of "teaching to fish."</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion: Moving Towards a More Equitable, Inclusive, and Sustainable Future</h3>
            <p>In today's world where the digital wave is sweeping across the globe, the international aid system is facing unprecedented opportunities for transformation. The combination of blockchain technology, skill training, and micro-aid offers the possibility of building a fairer, more transparent, and sustainable international aid ecosystem.</p>
