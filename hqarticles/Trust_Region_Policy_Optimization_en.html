            <h2>Introduction: The Paradigm Crisis of Trust Zones</h2>
            <p>
                In today's increasingly complex digital systems, where multi-agent collaboration is the norm, "<strong>trust zones</strong>"—i.e., system boundaries and interaction spaces jointly recognized as trustworthy—are facing a <strong>paradigm crisis</strong>. Traditional strategies rely on static network segmentation, risk-score-based access control, or zero-trust architectures (e.g., NIST SP 800-207). However, their essence remains rooted in a "<strong>boundary-defense mindset</strong>," struggling to address dynamic challenges such as <strong>rapid technological iteration, organizational cognitive misalignment, and multi-party strategic behavior</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This paper proposes the <strong>Tripartite Co-evolution Framework</strong> (<strong>Technology-Cognition-Game, TCG</strong>), treating trust zones as dynamic ecosystems co-evolving through <strong>technological self-organization, organizational cognitive embedding, and game-theoretic incentive mechanisms</strong>. On this foundation, we construct a <strong>Trust Ecosystem Governance Model</strong> (<strong>TE-GM</strong>, <i>Trust Ecosystem Governance Model</i>)—an interdisciplinary governance paradigm integrating complexity science, organizational behavior, and game theory. This model enables a fundamental paradigm shift: from <strong>reactive defense</strong> to <strong>proactive guidance</strong>, from <strong>technical compliance</strong> to <strong>cognitive alignment</strong>, and from <strong>coercive control</strong> to <strong>incentive-compatible design</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>I. The Tripartite Co-evolution Framework: Co-evolutionary Logic and Mechanism Deconstruction</h2>

            <h3>1. Technological Dimension: Evolutionary Dynamics of Trust Topology and the Trust Evolution Engine (TEE)</h3>
            <div class="term-definition">
                <span class="term">Trust Evolution Engine</span> (<strong>TEE</strong>, <i>Trust Evolution Engine</i>) is an adaptive mechanism based on complexity science. It dynamically assesses the "<strong>trust potential</strong>" of technical components by monitoring their <strong>behavioral consistency, interaction pattern stability, and fault recovery capability</strong>, and drives structural reconfiguration of trust zones.
            </div>
            <p>
                While traditional zero-trust architectures emphasize "never trust, always verify," their static policies struggle to adapt to technological realities such as <strong>elastic scaling in microservices, dynamic drift in AI systems, and heterogeneity in edge computing</strong>. Drawing from <strong>technological evolution theory</strong> (Arthur, 2009) and <strong>complex network science</strong> (Barabási, 2016), we introduce "<strong>evolutionary dynamics of trust topology</strong>"—where the structure of trust zones is not predefined but emerges through <strong>Trust Module Reconfiguration</strong> (TMR, <i>Trust Module Reconfiguration</i>) during runtime.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Key Mechanisms</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trust Interaction Graph</strong>: Build a dynamic directed graph based on API calls, data flows, and service dependencies to identify highly coupled and consistent modules;</li>
                <li><strong>Trust Potential Assessment Model</strong>: Integrate behavioral logs, zero-trust policy compliance scores, and AI anomaly detection (e.g., SHAP value drift rate) to quantify a module’s "<strong>trustworthiness index</strong>";</li>
                <li><strong>TEE-Driven Evolution</strong>: When a module (e.g., an AI inference node) demonstrates high explainability and low behavioral drift over sustained low-risk interactions, TEE can automatically promote it to a "<strong>Trust Core</strong>" (Trust Core), granting it cross-domain decision-making authority.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="highlight"><strong>Innovation</strong>: Trust zones shift from "<strong>policy-defined</strong>" to "<strong>ecosystem-emergent</strong>," enabling <strong>adaptive trust boundaries</strong> in technical systems.</p>

            <h3>2. Cognitive Dimension: Collective Mental Models and the Cognitive Alignment Mechanism (CAM)</h3>
            <div class="term-definition">
                <span class="term">Cognitive Alignment Mechanism</span> (<strong>CAM</strong>, <i>Cognitive Alignment Mechanism</i>) is an organizational behavior-based strategy adaptation system. It constructs an <strong>Organizational Cognitive Map</strong> (<strong>OCM</strong>, <i>Organizational Cognitive Map</i>) to identify how different roles define, perceive, and bound "trust," and designs differentiated policy interfaces accordingly.
            </div>
            <p>
                Trust zones are not merely technical constructs but also manifestations of <strong>shared mental models</strong> (SMM, <i>Shared Mental Model</i>) among organizational members (Cannon-Bowers et al., 1995). Yet, organizations commonly exhibit <strong>cognitive stratification</strong>: executives focus on strategic compliance, engineers on system availability, users on privacy and convenience, and compliance officers on audit trails. When policies are unilaterally designed by security teams, it leads to "<strong>policy fatigue</strong>" or rampant "shadow IT."
            </p>
            <p><strong>Key Mechanisms</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>OCM Construction</strong>: Use semi-structured interviews, behavioral logs, and cognitive surveys (Likert scales) to map cognitive coordinates across five dimensions: <strong>compliance-efficiency-privacy-collaborativeness-risk tolerance</strong>;</li>
                <li><strong>CAM Strategy Adaptation</strong>: Provide R&D teams with a "<strong>sandboxed high-trust zone</strong>" (allowing rapid deployment with automated auditing), finance departments with a "<strong>strongly verified low-latency zone</strong>" (high security with streamlined workflows), and end-users with a "<strong>transparent and explainable zone</strong>" (traceable behavior, revocable permissions);</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Feedback Loop</strong>: When a policy causes high cognitive conflict (e.g., developers frequently bypassing rules), the system automatically triggers policy reassessment and CAM realignment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="highlight"><strong>Innovation</strong>: The "<strong>organizational adoption rate</strong>" of trust policies no longer depends solely on technical strength but on whether they achieve "<strong>semantic alignment</strong>" with organizational cognition.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>3. Game-Theoretic Dimension: Trust as Capital — Signaling Games and the Reputation Market</h3>
            <div class="term-definition">
                <span class="term">Trust Market</span> (<strong>Trust Market</strong>) is a game-theoretic incentive mechanism that converts trustworthy behaviors (e.g., compliant operations, proactive audits, vulnerability disclosures, data sharing) into quantifiable and tradable "<strong>trust tokens</strong>" (Trust Tokens), optimizing trust resource allocation through dynamic reputation pricing.
            </div>
            <p>
                Traditional zero-trust assumes all entities are potential threats. In reality, entity behavior is <strong>heterogeneous</strong>: some consistently comply ("high-reputation actors"), others show occasional anomalies ("volatile actors"), and some are persistently malicious ("low-reputation actors"). Treating all uniformly leads to "<strong>verification overload</strong>" and "<strong>trust waste</strong>."
            </p>
            <p>
                We introduce <strong>Spence's signaling game</strong> (Spence, 1973) and the <strong>Fudenberg-Tirole reputation model</strong> (1986) to build a "<strong>dynamic trust reputation pricing mechanism</strong>":
            </p>
            <p><strong>Key Mechanisms</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trust Token Issuance</strong>: Entities earn tokens (ERC-20 compatible, verifiable on-chain) by proactively disclosing vulnerabilities, participating in security drills, maintaining complete logs, and cross-domain collaboration;</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Reputation Pricing</strong>: The system calculates a "<strong>Trust Capital Index</strong>" (TCI) in real time based on token holdings, behavioral stability, and network centrality (e.g., core node status);</li>
                <li><strong>Incentive-Compatible Design</strong>: High-TCI entities gain "exemption from verification," "priority in cross-domain collaboration," and "enhanced governance voting power"; low-TCI entities trigger "trust degradation" and "isolation review," creating a "<strong>positive Matthew effect in trust</strong>."</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="highlight"><strong>Innovation</strong>: Transforms "trust" from a <strong>security cost</strong> into a <strong>tradable capital</strong>, achieving <strong>endogenous security</strong>—where security becomes the optimal rational choice for participants.</p>

            <h2>III. Future Outlook: Revolutionary Potential of TE-GM in Emerging Scenarios</h2>

            <h3>1. AI Autonomous Systems: Case Study – "An Autonomous Driving Company"</h3>
            <p>
                In an autonomous vehicle fleet, AI agents must collaborate in real time. One company adopts TE-GM, treating <strong>decision consistency</strong> (e.g., route stability), <strong>goal alignment</strong> (with human intent), and <strong>explainability</strong> (readable decision logs) as "trust signals." TEE identifies high-trust agent clusters ("trust alliances"), allowing them to share high-precision maps and real-time traffic data. The Trust Market issues "<strong>Autonomous Driving Trust Points</strong>" (ADT), enabling high-point agents to receive priority scheduling or emergency decision rights. OCM is extended to "<strong>AI-Human Mental Model Alignment</strong>," ensuring clear cognitive boundaries.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Results</strong>: 40% improvement in collaboration efficiency, 25% reduction in accident rates, 35% increase in user trust scores.</p>

            <h3>2. Metaverse Organizations: Case Study – "A DAO Education Platform"</h3>
            <p>
                In a metaverse education DAO, members collaborate via virtual identities. The platform builds a "<strong>virtual cognitive map</strong>" to identify trust preferences across cultures (e.g., East Asian users prefer "authority-based verification," Western users prefer "transparent processes"). The Trust Market issues "<strong>Metaverse Learning Coins</strong>" (MLC), redeemable for courses, NFT certificates, or governance voting rights. TEE dynamically adjusts virtual classroom trust boundaries: high-reputation users can create core courses; low-reputation users are limited to auditing.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Results</strong>: 50% increase in user engagement, significant improvement in content quality, 60% rise in governance voting rates.</p>

            <h3>3. Decentralized Identity (DID): Case Study – "A Cross-Border DID Consortium"</h3>
            <p>
                In a DID system, a consortium uses TE-GM to build a <strong>on-chain reputation protocol</strong>. It integrates off-chain behavior (e.g., KYC, social interactions, credit records) with on-chain behavior (e.g., transactions, contract calls, governance participation) to generate <strong>verifiable trust tokens</strong> (VT-Token). OCM helps DID holders understand their "trust profile"; TEE dynamically optimizes trust strategies per context (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs in high-privacy scenarios, partial data sharing in high-collaboration scenarios).
            </p>
            <p><strong>Results</strong>: Cross-border identity verification time reduced from 3 days to 1 hour; identity misuse incidents decreased by 70%.</p>

            <h2>IV. Research Limitations and Future Directions</h2>
            <p>
                While TE-GM provides a systematic framework, several limitations remain:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Privacy Challenges in Cognitive Data Collection</strong>: OCM requires cognitive data (e.g., surveys, interviews), raising privacy concerns. Future work should explore <strong>differential privacy</strong> and <strong>federated learning</strong> for cognitive analysis to achieve "data usable but not visible."</li>
                <li><strong>Fairness Risks in Game Mechanisms</strong>: The Trust Market may intensify the "<strong>Matthew effect of trust</strong>" (high-reputation actors gain more trust, low-reputation actors struggle to recover). Introducing <strong>reputation decay mechanisms</strong> (e.g., 10% monthly decay) and <strong>support programs for new participants</strong> (e.g., initial token subsidies) can ensure fairness.</li>
                <li><strong>Inter-Organizational Trust Interoperability</strong>: TE-GM works within single organizations, but cross-organizational trust requires <strong>standardized trust protocols</strong>. Future work may build a <strong>Cross-Organizational Trust Interoperability Framework</strong> (COTIF) based on W3C Verifiable Credentials (VC) and DID.</li>
                <li><strong>AI Ethical Risks</strong>: In AI autonomous systems, TE-GM may grant AI "trust decision-making power," necessitating <strong>human oversight mechanisms</strong> (e.g., "human veto rights") and <strong>ethical review processes</strong> (e.g., AI behavior audit committees).</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Future Research Directions</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explore <strong>multi-agent reinforcement learning</strong> (MARL) in TEE for multi-agent co-evolution;</li>
                <li>Build a <strong>Cross-Organizational Trust Market</strong> (COTM) to enable cross-domain trust capital flow;</li>
                <li>Study <strong>the impact of cultural differences on OCM</strong>, developing "culturally adaptive cognitive alignment models" for global trust governance;</li>
                <li>Investigate <strong>quantum-secure trust mechanisms</strong> to address future quantum computing threats to trust systems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion: The Era of Trust as an Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>
                Trust zones are no longer isolated "security boundaries" but <strong>dynamic ecosystems co-shaped by technological self-organization, cognitive embedding, and game-theoretic incentives</strong>. The significance of TE-GM lies not only in enhancing security but in transforming trust into a <strong>systematic, marketized, and ecological</strong> force—ultimately enabling a fundamental leap from "<strong>trust defense</strong>" to "<strong>trust creation</strong>."
            </p>
            <p>
                In emerging domains like AI, metaverse, and DID, trust is no longer a "guaranteed state" but a "produced capital." TE-GM is precisely the <strong>governance foundation</strong> for building this new civilization.
            </p>
