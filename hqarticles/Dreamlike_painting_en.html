Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought about significant advancements in social efficiency, but it has also raised serious concerns regarding personal data privacy. AI systems rely heavily on vast amounts of data, often containing sensitive user information such as location and behavioral preferences, which can lead to three main risks: covert infringement during data collection, misuse for commercial or illegal gain, and the re-identification of anonymized data through multi-source correlation.

To address these issues, a multi-faceted approach is necessary. Technically, the principle of data minimization should be appliedâ€”collecting only the essential data needed for core functions. Differential privacy techniques can protect individual information by adding mathematical noise without compromising overall data utility. Federated learning is another promising approach, where models are trained locally on users' devices, thereby avoiding the centralization of raw data.

Regulatory frameworks also play a crucial role. Policies such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandate informed consent and enforce strict controls over data handling throughout its lifecycle.

Data privacy protection is a systemic endeavor requiring coordination between technological innovation, regulatory oversight, and corporate responsibility, alongside enhanced public awareness of data rights. Only by building an ecosystem of shared governance can we unlock the potential of AI while ensuring robust privacy safeguards.
