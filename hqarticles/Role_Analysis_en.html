            <h2>Character Analysis: Multidimensional Interpretation from Symbol to Subject</h2>
            <p>In literary works, characters are not only the drivers of plot but also the bearers of meaning. They serve as the medium for the writer's thoughts, a microcosm of social reality, and a materialized representation of the human spiritual world. Through multidimensional analysis of characters, we can not only glimpse the deep structure of literary works but also touch upon the essential dilemmas of human existence and the spiritual landscape. This article will explore characters in classic literary works from three dimensions: social environment, narrative structure, and psychological subjectivity, revealing the complex interaction of characters as symbols and subjects, and how they reflect the human spiritual landscape in the mirror of literature.</p>

            <h3>I. Character and Social Interaction: Survival Struggles in "Camel Xiangzi"</h3>
            <p>"Camel Xiangzi" by Lao She, with its profound depiction of the living conditions of the lower class, constructs a picture of the intense collision between the individual and society in a modern context. Xiangzi is not just a rickshaw puller in Lao She's narrative but a symbol of the "atomized individual" alienated in the process of modernization. His fate is not solely determined by personal choice but is a result shaped by social structures and historical processes.</p>
            <p>When Xiangzi first arrives in Beijing, his physical characteristics—"strong, silent, and full of vitality"—symbolize the primitive vitality conferred by rural civilization. However, this vitality gradually disintegrates under the crushing force of urban civilization. The city is not just a physical space but also a social field composed of capital logic and class stratification. Xiangzi's choice to pull rickshaws for a living is, in fact, a passive choice, a coercive arrangement of social structures on individual survival methods. Pulling rickshaws is not just the consumption of physical strength but also the continuous erosion of personal dignity and value.</p>
            <p>Under the operating mechanism of a capitalist society, Xiangzi's labor is commodified, becoming an object of trade. His labor achievements—income and vehicles—are his only "property," but these are always in an unstable state. Xiangzi's two failed attempts to purchase a vehicle are not just personal setbacks but systemic squeezing of the living space of lower-class laborers by social institutions. His body is gradually worn out under the excessive labor, becoming an insignificant part of the social machine, losing its initial vitality.</p>
            <p>Xiangzi's downfall is not just the collapse of personal will but also the inevitable result of social alienation. His simple nature gradually disintegrates in the cold urban interpersonal relationships, eventually becoming vulgar and instrumentalized. Xiangzi's fate reveals the deep contradictions between the individual and society in a modern context: in the pursuit of survival and development, individuals are often forced to abandon themselves, becoming appendages of the social machine. Xiangzi's downfall is not just a personal tragedy but also a metaphor for the alienation of human nature in modern society.</p>

            <h3>II. Character and Narrative Intertextuality: Multiple Mirrors and Life Networks in "Dream of the Red Chamber"</h3>
            <p>"Dream of the Red Chamber" by Cao Xueqin, through its complex narrative structure and character network, constructs a historical canvas about human nature, fate, and society. Jia Baoyu, as the central character, is not just an individual but also a multiple mirror of the entire narrative structure. His existence forms an intertextual relationship with the entire narrative network, revealing the multidimensionality of human nature and the complexity of society.</p>
            <p>Jia Baoyu's multiple mirrors are manifested in his complex relationships with the jade of spiritual transcendence, the女儿国 in the Grand View Garden, and the rise and fall of the Jia family. The jade of spiritual transcendence symbolizes the transcendental dimension; it is both a symbol of Jia Baoyu's soul and a philosophical metaphor of the entire story. The女儿国 in the Grand View Garden is a concrete representation of Jia Baoyu's ideal and real conflicts, where he experiences pure emotions and ideal interpersonal relationships, but this ideal is eventually shattered by the cruelty of reality. The rise and fall of the Jia family is the macro backdrop of Jia Baoyu's fate, symbolizing the historical changes of the family and society.</p>
            <p>The opposition between Daiyu and Baochai is a classic example of narrative intertextuality. Daiyu symbolizes poetry and spirituality, representing the individual's pursuit of freedom and ideals; Baochai symbolizes practicality and worldliness, representing the individual's survival strategies in society. This opposition is not just the opposition of characters but also the internal tension of the narrative structure. Readers see the fragility and tragedy of idealism in Daiyu and the coldness and inevitability of realism in Baochai.</p>
            <p>The temporal structure of the narrative is not linear but circular, serving as a tragic rehearsal. The successive deaths of Qin Zhong, Qingwen, and Daiyu form a "circular pattern of death," where each character's demise is a rehearsal of the fate of others and a confirmation of the tragedy structure of the entire story. This multiple mirroring of time makes the relationship between characters and narrative more complex, revealing the inevitability of fate and the fragility of life.</p>

            <h3>III. Character Psychology and Ideological Subjectivity: Spiritual Alienation in "1984"</h3>
            <p>"1984" by George Orwell, with its profound critique of totalitarian society, reveals the process of spiritual alienation of individuals under high-pressure environments. Winston Smith, as the protagonist of the novel, is not just a victim of totalitarianism but also a symbol of the spiritual困境 of individuals in extreme social environments. By analyzing Winston's psychological state and ideology, we can gain a deeper understanding of the destruction of human nature by totalitarianism and the survival strategies of individuals under oppression.</p>
            <p>Winston's initial psychological state is filled with resistance to reality, but this resistance is fragile and ambiguous. He writes "Down with Big Brother" in his diary, symbolizing the individual's challenge to authority but also exposing his fear and helplessness. Winston's resistance is not based on a clear ideological framework but is rooted in his disgust for reality and an instinctive desire for freedom. However, this resistance appears pale and powerless in the harsh social environment, eventually being swallowed by the totalitarian ideology.</p>
            <p>Winston's romance with Julia is a brief attempt to find humanity and freedom in the extreme social environment. Julia symbolizes vitality and rebellion against totalitarianism, bringing Winston temporary emotional solace. However, this romance is ultimately destroyed by the Party's violent machinery, becoming the spark for Winston's mental collapse. Winston's ideology gradually disintegrates during this process, realizing that individuals cannot resist the entire totalitarian system and ultimately choosing compromise.</p>
            <p>Winston's tragedy reveals the comprehensive suppression of individuals by totalitarianism. It not only destroys individuals through external violence and control but also thoroughly dismantles individual independent thought through psychological manipulation and the reshaping of ideology. Winston's downfall is not just the failure of personal resistance but also the complete alienation of human nature by totalitarianism. His story shows that in a society completely dominated by totalitarianism, individual freedom and dignity are so fragile and insignificant.</p>
