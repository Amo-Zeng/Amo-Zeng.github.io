            <h3>Ecological Education View: Harmony between Humans and Nature</h3>
            <h4>Deep Integration of Education with Nature</h4>
            <p>Tao Xingzhi's concept of "Teaching, Learning, and Doing as One" is not just an educational method but the core spirit of ecological education. He advocated that education should be closely integrated with the natural environment and social life, allowing students to understand the dynamic balance and fragility of ecosystems through interaction with nature. For example, at Xiaozhuang Normal College, students not only planted in the schoolyard but also participated in farming activities, which was not only educational practice but also cultivated students' respect and sense of responsibility towards nature.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Experiential Learning:</strong> Students learn in nature, gaining not only knowledge but also fostering awe and care for the environment. This educational approach emphasizes emotional experiences, encouraging students to develop a lifestyle in harmony with nature.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Awareness and Action:</strong> Students under Tao's education learned about waste sorting, recycling, and other environmental behaviors from an early age, developing a sense of responsibility and action as global citizens.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Social Engagement and Civic Consciousness</h4>
            <p>Tao Xingzhi believed that education is a vital path for social reform. He encouraged students to engage in community service, social surveys, and other activities to understand the complexities of social issues and practice civic responsibilities in real life. This extends education and puts social justice into practice.</p>

            <h3>Maker Spirit: Innovation Practice and Interdisciplinary Learning</h3>
            <h4>Education Philosophy of "Learning by Doing"</h4>
            <p>Tao Xingzhi's "Unity of Knowledge and Action" aligns closely with the core ideas of modern maker education. Students learn through designing, making, and sharing projects, fostering their hands-on capabilities, innovative thinking, and problem-solving skills.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cultivation of Innovation:</strong> Through project-based learning and design thinking, students learn from iterations of failure and success, understanding the uncertainties and importance of continuous improvement in the innovation process.</li>
                <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Skills:</strong> When completing projects, students integrate knowledge from various disciplines to solve technical, collaborative, and design problems, embodying Tao's idea of "Life is Education."</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Practice of Interdisciplinary Education</h4>
            <p>Tao Xingzhi's advocated "Holistic Education" emphasizes the comprehensive development of students' morality, intelligence, physicality, aesthetics, and labor, which complements the interdisciplinary learning in maker education.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Integration and Application of Knowledge:</strong> Students apply knowledge from mathematics, physics, arts, etc., in projects, enhancing their overall qualities. This learning method is not just an accumulation of knowledge but the growth of wisdom.</li>
                <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Project Learning:</strong> Through project-driven learning and the construction of maker spaces, students naturally engage in interdisciplinary thinking, promoting multidimensional ability cultivation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Educational Equity and Social Justice</h3>
            <h4>Deepening Rural Education</h4>
            <p>Tao Xingzhi dedicated his life to promoting rural education, emphasizing equal educational opportunities. Through Xiaozhuang Normal College, he aimed to address the lack of educational resources in rural areas, providing children from impoverished regions with the chance to change their destinies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resource Allocation and Educational Equity:</strong> In modern education, the state and society should increase investment in education for impoverished areas to ensure equitable distribution of educational resources, promote educational equity, and realize the ideal of "Education for All."</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Educational Perspective on Social Reform</h4>
            <p>Tao Xingzhi was not only concerned with education but also with social justice. Through educational reform, he cultivated students' sense of social responsibility and justice, making education a crucial tool for social mobility.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Course Content and Social Reality:</strong> Course content should reflect social realities, fostering students' sense of justice and encouraging them to play a positive role in future society.</li>
                <li><strong>Education Promotes Social Mobility:</strong> High-quality education can elevate individuals' socio-economic status, promote social justice, and reduce inequality.</li>
            </ul>

His thoughts provide us with a comprehensive educational view, emphasizing that education is not merely about imparting knowledge but is key to shaping a just society and advancing social progress.
