            <h2>Reconstructing Carrying Capacity: From Ecological Carrying Capacity to the Anthropocene</h2>
            <p>As human activities increasingly exert profound impacts on the Earth system, we are gradually entering a new geological era known as the "Anthropocene." In this context, the traditional concept of carrying capacity based on ecological carrying capacity has exposed significant limitations, necessitating a broader, multidimensional redefinition. This article will delve into the new definition of carrying capacity and its central role in sustainable development from perspectives such as social-ecological systems, planetary boundaries theory, and the multidimensional view of the Anthropocene.</p>

            <h3>1. Challenges of the Anthropocene and Limitations of Traditional Carrying Capacity Concepts</h3>
            <p>In the Anthropocene, human activities have become the dominant force shaping the Earth's environment, with issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental pollution rapidly spreading globally. Traditional, region-based carrying capacity concepts struggle to address these cross-border, global challenges. Their main limitations include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lack of a global perspective:</strong> Traditional concepts overlook the profound impacts of globalization factors such as human migration, trade, and resource sharing on carrying capacity.</li>
                <li><strong>Insufficient consideration of comprehensive benefits:</strong> Excessive focus on population size, while neglecting the complex interactions between population structure, consumption patterns, technological levels, and resource consumption and environmental impacts.</li>
                <li><strong>Ineffective response to dynamic changes:</strong> The Earth system itself undergoes continuous dynamic changes, and traditional static capacity concepts are ill-equipped to handle future uncertainties.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. The Perspective of Social-Ecological Systems: Complexity and Dynamic Balance</h3>
            <p>Exploring carrying capacity from the perspective of social-ecological systems means we need to consider it within the broader network of intertwined social, economic, cultural, and ecological factors. Social factors play a crucial role in determining the carrying capacity of a region or country, as human societies do not exist in isolation but are the result of interactions with the natural environment and other social systems.</p>
            <h4>2.1 Social Systems and Policies</h4>
            <p>Social systems and policies are core determinants of carrying capacity. Government policies, such as birth policies, immigration policies, land use policies, and resource management policies, directly influence population growth and distribution. For example, a country's birth policy may restrict population growth, while immigration policies may promote population inflows or outflows. Additionally, resource allocation is closely related to social systems, and fair resource distribution can enhance overall social welfare, thereby increasing carrying capacity.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Economic Structure and Technological Advancement</h4>
            <p>Economic structure and technological advancement significantly impact carrying capacity. The type of economic activity in a region determines its demand for and reliance on natural resources. For instance, agricultural and industrial societies utilize natural resources in截然different ways, affecting their carrying capacities. Furthermore, technological progress can improve resource use efficiency, reduce environmental pressures, and expand carrying capacity.</p>
            <h4>2.3 Culture and Values</h4>
            <p>Culture and social values also play an important role in determining carrying capacity. Different cultures have varying approaches to resource use, attitudes toward reproduction, and awareness of environmental protection. For example, some cultures may encourage large families, while others may emphasize resource conservation and environmental protection.</p>
            <h4>2.4 Social Capital and Social Cohesion</h4>
            <p>Social capital and social cohesion are soft factors within social-ecological systems but play a critical role in maintaining carrying capacity. Social capital includes elements such as trust, cooperation, and networks, which facilitate resource sharing and rational use, enhancing the society's resilience to risks.</p>

            <h3>3. Planetary Boundaries Theory: The Integrity of Earth's Life Support Systems</h3>
            <p>"Planetary boundaries" is a concept proposed by an international team of scientists to identify and quantify nine critical Earth system parameters. Exceeding these boundaries could lead to irreversible changes in the Earth system, threatening human survival. These nine boundaries include: climate change, ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, freshwater use, land system change, atmospheric aerosol loading, chemical pollution, and ozone layer depletion.</p>
            <p>Based on the planetary boundaries theory, carrying capacity can be redefined as: the maximum population Earth can support while maintaining the stability of the Earth's life support systems. This definition emphasizes the following points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Carrying capacity is a dynamic range:</strong> It depends on various factors such as technological level, resource use efficiency, and environmental management, rather than a fixed number.</li>
                <li><strong>Carrying capacity requires a global perspective:</strong> Global issues such as climate change, ocean acidification, and biodiversity loss require global collaboration, as no country or region can address them in isolation.</li>
                <li><strong>Carrying capacity requires intergenerational fairness:</strong> Our generation's development must not come at the expense of future generations' living environments, and we must leave a healthy Earth for future generations.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>4. Practical Pathways Toward Human Development Capacity</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Support:</strong> Establish a globally unified ecological, social, and economic data platform to provide precise data support for carrying capacity assessments.</li>
                <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Collaboration:</strong> Integrate the strengths of ecology, demography, economics, and sociology to build comprehensive assessment models.</li>
                <li><strong>Policy Guidance:</strong> Incorporate carrying capacity assessments into national development strategies, formulating policies to guide rational population distribution and optimize resource allocation.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Participation:</strong> Enhance public awareness of carrying capacity issues and guide the formation of sustainable consumption and lifestyle habits.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In the context of the Anthropocene, the redefinition of carrying capacity is not only a transcendence of the traditional ecological carrying capacity perspective but also a profound reflection on the relationship between humanity and the Earth. From the complexity and dynamic balance of social-ecological systems to the global perspective of planetary boundaries theory, we need a broader vision, a more systematic approach, and a longer-term perspective to explore new paths for harmonious coexistence between humanity and the Earth. Only by respecting natural laws and developing within the safe operating space of the Earth can humanity achieve true prosperity and sustainability, creating a future of sustainable development for future generations.</p>
