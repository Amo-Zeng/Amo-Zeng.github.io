            <h2>Evolution and Integration of Economic Schools: From Historical Evolution to Interdisciplinary Innovation</h2>
            <p>Economics, as a core discipline studying resource allocation and benefit distribution in human society, has its theories and thoughts not only as subjects of academic discussion but also as significant forces influencing social and economic development. The evolution and innovation of economic schools are akin to "genetic mutations" in biological evolution, continuously adjusting and innovating themselves in response to challenges of the times and complex problems. Meanwhile, interdisciplinary integration and the struggle for discourse power have become new trends in the development of economic schools, driving the diversification of economic thoughts and the deepening of practical applications. This article will explore the evolutionary journey of economic schools and its profound impact on social development from three dimensions: historical evolution, interdisciplinary integration, and the struggle for discourse power.</p>

            <h3>The Evolution of Economic Schools: From Classical to Modern "Genetic Mutations"</h3>
            <p>The history of economics is one of continuous ideological evolution, with each significant economic event and social change driving the innovation of economic schools. From classical to modern economic schools, economic thought has undergone transformations from laissez-faire to government intervention, and from rational analysis to behavioral research.</p>
            <p><strong>Classical economic schools</strong>, represented by Adam Smith and David Ricardo, emphasize the self-regulating role of markets, proposing the labor theory of value and laissez-faire ideas. However, with the rise of the marginal revolution, <strong>neoclassical economic schools</strong> introduced mathematical tools to construct more refined equilibrium analysis frameworks, emphasizing the assumption of rational individuals and utility maximization, becoming the mainstream economic thought of the 20th century. Yet, the Great Depression of the 1930s shattered the myth of market omnipotence, leading to the emergence of <strong>Keynesianism</strong>, which introduced the theory of effective demand and advocated government intervention through fiscal and monetary policies to address economic crises and unemployment.</p>
            <p>Entering the 21st century, the development of globalization and information technology brought new challenges, further diversifying and innovating economic schools. <strong>Experimental economics and behavioral economics</strong> revealed the irrational factors in human behavior through experimental data and psychological research, challenging the traditional assumption of rational individuals. <strong>Complexity economics</strong> introduced complex system theory into economics, exploring nonlinear and self-organizing phenomena in economic systems, providing new perspectives for understanding financial crises and economic cycles. Meanwhile, <strong>green economics and sustainable development theories</strong> incorporated environmental factors into economic analysis frameworks, proposing new models such as circular and low-carbon economies, offering theoretical support for addressing global environmental issues.</p>

            <h3>Interdisciplinary Integration: Breaking Disciplinary Barriers for Comprehensive Economic Analysis</h3>
            <p>A notable feature of modern economic research is interdisciplinary integration, which not only injects new vitality into economics but also provides diverse perspectives and tools for solving complex economic problems. The cross-disciplinary integration of neuroscience, computer science, and sociology is reshaping the theoretical system and practical applications of economics.</p>
            <p><strong>The dialogue between neuroscience and economics</strong> offers new insights into understanding human economic behavior. The traditional assumption of rational individuals disregards the role of emotions and intuition in decision-making, while neuroscience research reveals the roles of dopamine, amygdala, and other neural mechanisms in reward expectation, risk preference, and loss aversion. These findings not only challenge traditional economic assumptions but also provide new explanatory frameworks for studying market fluctuations and investor behavior.</p>
            <p><strong>The collaborative innovation between computer science and economics</strong> has revolutionized economic research through big data and artificial intelligence technologies. The real-time and multidimensional nature of big data enables economists to extract micro factors affecting economic behavior from sources such as social media, traffic flow, and e-commerce platforms. The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies has made economic forecasting and policy simulation more accurate and efficient.</p>
            <p><strong>The cross-disciplinary research between sociology and economics</strong> reveals the significant impact of social networks on economic behavior. Social network analysis shows that individual economic behavior is not only influenced by market mechanisms but also constrained by social relationships and resource allocation.</p>

            <h3>The Struggle for Discourse Power: The Debate among Economic Schools and Its Dialectical Relationship with Social Development</h3>
            <p>The debate among economic schools is not merely an academic dispute but a struggle for economic policy-making power and discourse power. Different economic schools represent different interests and value orientations, and their interpretations and policy recommendations directly influence the direction of social and economic development.</p>
            <p><strong>The relationship between economic schools and government decision-making</strong> is particularly close. During past economic crises, the policy proposals of different economic schools have served as important references for government decisions. For example, following the 2008 global financial crisis, the government interventionist ideas of the Keynesian economic school once again became mainstream, with governments around the world implementing fiscal stimulus plans and accommodative monetary policies to address the crisis.</p>
            <p><strong>The interaction between economic schools and public opinion</strong> further amplifies their influence. Economic schools influence public perceptions and attitudes towards economic issues through media and academic dissemination.</p>
            <p><strong>The shaping of international economic order by economic schools</strong> reflects their global influence. The differing understandings and policy stances of economic schools on globalization, trade liberalization, and international economic governance directly impact the evolution of the global economic landscape.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Evolution of Economic Schools and the Future of Social Development</h3>
            <p>The evolution, interdisciplinary integration, and struggle for discourse power of economic schools collectively form the dynamic landscape of economic development. Economic schools continue to drive the innovation of economic theories and practical applications by adapting to the challenges of the times. Interdisciplinary integration injects new vitality into economics, providing diverse perspectives and tools. The struggle for discourse power highlights the profound impact of economics on social and economic development.</p>
            <p>However, the debate among economic schools also reveals the limitations of economic theories. Economic issues are complex and multidimensional, and no single economic school can comprehensively explain and solve all problems. Therefore, when formulating economic policies, it is necessary to consider the perspectives of different economic schools comprehensively to avoid falling into the trap of a single theory.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, economic schools will continue to advance through integration and innovation, providing more effective solutions to global challenges and promoting sustainable development of human society.</p>
