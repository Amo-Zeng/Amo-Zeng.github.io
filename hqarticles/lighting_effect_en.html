            <h2>Light and Shadow: The Magician Breaking "Reality"</h2>
            <p>Light and shadow, fundamental phenomena in the physical world, are also core elements in artistic creation. They break our inherent perceptions of "reality" in a unique way, shaping spatial forms, telling silent stories, and serving as the bridge connecting science and art.</p>

            <h3>Light and Shadow in Illusion Art</h3>
            <p>The magic of light and shadow is first reflected in its ability to create illusions beyond physical reality. Using projectors and silhouette techniques, artists can create a sense of three-dimensional space on flat walls.</p>

            <h3>Light and Shadow in Virtual Reality</h3>
            <p>In the field of virtual reality (VR), the role of light and shadow is equally significant. Traditional VR technology often relies on simple lighting models, which struggle to simulate the complex light and shadow changes in the real world.</p>

            <h2>Light and Shadow: The Silent Narrator</h2>
            <p>In the world of films and stage plays, light and shadow are a silent language. Without dialogue, they strike the heart, create atmosphere, shape characters, and drive the plot.</p>

            <h3>Contrast of Light and Dark: The Strength of Emotion</h3>
            <p>The contrast between light and dark is the most direct and intense expression in light and shadow storytelling. Bright light is like a spark of hope, illuminating the bright side of a character's inner world and conveying positive, optimistic emotions.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Layers of Light and Shadow: The Complexity of the Heart</h3>
            <p>The layers of light and shadow are as complex and varied as the human heart. A single light and shadow cannot express the ebb and flow within a character, while layered light and shadow can reveal the character's inner world more three-dimensionally and delicately.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Flow of Light and Shadow: The Passage of Time</h3>
            <p>The flow of light and shadow is like the passage of time, silent yet irreversible. Directors use the flow of light and shadow to represent the passage of time, the development of the plot, and the changes in a character's inner world.</p>
