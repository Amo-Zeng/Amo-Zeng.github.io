            <h2>Ecosystem and Social Capital Perspectives on Social Policy: Dual Challenges for Sustainable Development</h2>
            <p>In contemporary social governance, the formulation and implementation of social policies are not merely the products of administrative management but also a dual reflection of social psychology and ecosystems. With the intensification of global ecological crises and the deepening of structural inequalities, traditional policy evaluation methods are no longer sufficient to address complex social and environmental challenges. This article aims to re-examine the effectiveness, fairness, and sustainability of social policies from the dual perspectives of ecosystems and social capital, and to construct a new framework for policy evaluation towards addressing the dual challenges of sustainable development.</p>

            <h3>I. The Interaction of Policy Mirroring and Ecosystems: The Deep Mechanism of Social Governance</h3>
            <p>Social policies are not only the concrete expression of social psychology but also the product of ecosystem feedback. They function like a mirror, reflecting both collective social psychology and shaping our perceptions of society and nature through the process of implementation. For example, the minimum living guarantee system not only embodies care for vulnerable groups but also directly impacts the fairness of resource distribution; educational policies not only respond to societal expectations for educational equity but may also indirectly influence the utilization of ecological resources. The interaction between policies and ecosystems constitutes the deep mechanism of social governance.</p>

            <h3>II. Social Capital and Network Structure: The Dual Pillars of Policy Implementation</h3>
            <p>Social capital and network structure are two key foundations for policy implementation. Social capital, accumulated through social relationship networks, enhances community cohesion, increases civic participation, and improves policy execution efficiency. Network structure determines the distribution and connectivity of social relationships, with different structures suitable for different policy needs. The success of policy implementation largely depends on the accumulation of social capital and the optimal configuration of network structures.</p>

            <h3>III. Social Policy Evaluation from an Ecosystem Perspective: Dual Challenges for Sustainable Development</h3>
            <p>Traditional social policy evaluations typically focus on economic indicators, social welfare, and governance, often neglecting the fundamental role of ecosystems in societal development. A policy evaluation framework from an ecosystem perspective should encompass the following key elements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Ecological Footprint Analysis</strong>: Assess the policy's impact on natural resource consumption and its environmental effects, avoiding unsustainable resource exploitation and environmental damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Biodiversity Protection</strong>: Measure the policy's impact on biodiversity, promoting ecosystem stability and resilience.</li>
                <li><strong>Carbon Emissions and Climate Change Mitigation</strong>: Evaluate the policy's effectiveness in controlling greenhouse gas emissions, driving low-carbon economic development, and enhancing climate change adaptation.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological Equity</strong>: While addressing social policy equity, attention must also be given to the fair distribution of ecological resources, preventing the exacerbation of ecological inequalities.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>IV. Case Study: The Practice of Social Capital and Ecosystems in Policies</h3>
            <p>Taking the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States as an example, social capital played a significant role in this policy. Community organizations, through dense social networks, effectively disseminated policy information, helping low-income groups understand and apply for health insurance. Meanwhile, decentralized network structures ensured that information spread rapidly across various parts of society, achieving widespread coverage of the policy. However, the implementation of this policy also needs to consider its impact on ecosystems, such as the consumption of medical resources and the disposal of waste.</p>

            <h3>V. Conclusion and Outlook: Constructing a New Policy Evaluation Framework for the Future</h3>
            <p>Social policies are not only the concrete expression of social psychology but also the dual interaction of ecosystems and social capital. By integrating the ecosystem perspective with social capital theory, policymakers can more comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness, fairness, and sustainability of policies. In the future, policy evaluation needs to be optimized in the following aspects:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Strengthening Interdisciplinary Collaboration</strong>: Policymakers and evaluators in social policies need to collaborate closely with ecologists, environmental scientists, and others to jointly develop eco-friendly social policies.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting Public Participation</strong>: Encourage public involvement in policy evaluation, enhancing citizens' ecological awareness and participation, and fostering societal commitment to sustainable development.</li>
                <li><strong>Developing Comprehensive Evaluation Indicators</strong>: Create a comprehensive evaluation system that includes ecological, economic, and social dimensions, providing a scientific basis for policy evaluation.</li>
            </ol>
