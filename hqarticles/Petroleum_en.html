        <section>
            <h2>Oil: The Underestimated Civilizational Variable</h2>
            <p>Oil is far more than a simple fossil fuel. It is the <span class="emph">metabolic core</span> of modern civilization—the blood of industrial society, the lubricant of global networks, and a deep-seated code embedded in the human psyche. Since the dawn of the internal combustion engine in the late 19th century, oil has quietly woven itself into every fiber of technological systems, financial orders, and daily life. It is not merely "energy," but a <span class="emph">civilizational variable</span>—its presence and flow directly determine the rhythm of modernity, the structure of power, and the patterns of human cognition.</p>
            <p>Yet, as the global climate crisis grows ever more urgent and carbon neutrality becomes a shared goal, we face a perplexing reality: <span class="highlight">renewable energy installations are surging year after year, yet oil demand continues to rise</span>. In 2023, global oil demand reached <span class="emph">102 million barrels per day</span>, surpassing pre-pandemic levels; an additional increase of 1.5 million barrels is expected in 2024. This "paradox of speed"—the more urgent decarbonization becomes, the more resilient oil appears—reveals a deeper <span class="emph">triple lock-in</span> within the energy transition: <strong>systemic inertia at the technological level, financial channels at the monetary level, and addictive memory at the psychological level</strong>.</p>
            <p>These three forms of lock-in are not isolated; they are deeply nested and mutually reinforcing, forming a <span class="emph">civilization-scale self-sustaining mechanism</span>. Only by deconstructing oil in three dimensions—from infrastructural path dependence, to the reconfiguration of global financial power, to the subconscious encoding of cultural psychology—can we truly understand that: <strong>energy transition is, at its core, a civilizational self-revolution</strong>.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>First Deconstruction: Systemic Inertia — Why "Greener Means More Oil"?</h2>
            <p>The expansion of renewable energy should reduce reliance on fossil fuels, yet the reality is a paradoxical phenomenon of "green dependency on oil." In 2023, global wind and solar capacity additions reached <span class="emph">510 gigawatts</span>, accounting for over 80% of new power investments. Yet, at the same time, demand for oil in peak load balancing has been rising. Germany increased its oil-fired peak capacity to <span class="emph">12 GW</span> during the 2022 energy crisis; Japan restarted 12 oil-fired plants in 2023 to cope with heatwaves; in California, diesel generator use surged by <span class="emph">300%</span> during the 2020 heatwave.</p>
            <p>The root of this paradox lies in the <span class="emph">"temporal mismatch" of infrastructure</span>. Renewables are intermittent and volatile, requiring power grids to be highly flexible, with sufficient storage and rapid response capabilities. Yet, global energy storage deployment lags at just <span class="emph">one-third the growth rate</span> of wind and solar. In 2022, curtailment of wind and solar power totaled <span class="emph">150 terawatt-hours</span>—equivalent to Germany's entire annual electricity consumption. To maintain grid stability, nations are forced to "use oil to protect green power"—oil has become the "shadow guardian" of renewables.</p>
            <p>Even deeper lies the <span class="emph">"cognitive resurgence" of energy security anxiety</span>. The Russia-Ukraine conflict shattered the illusion of "energy globalization," forcing nations to re-evaluate energy autonomy. In 2023, U.S. shale oil production exceeded <span class="emph">13 million barrels per day</span>, a historic high; India and China accelerated strategic reserve construction; the EU, despite pledging to phase out Russian oil by 2030, allowed member states to temporarily increase refined product imports. This logic of "short-term supply security overriding long-term decarbonization" has transformed oil from a "transitional energy" into a "security asset."</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the <span class="emph">"lock-in effect" in end-use sectors</span> is slowing decarbonization. Aviation, shipping, and heavy-duty trucks—sectors difficult to electrify—remain dependent on oil-based fuels. In 2023, global jet fuel consumption recovered to <span class="emph">95%</span> of 2019 levels, while sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) accounted for less than <span class="emph">0.5%</span>. Even more intractable is the petrochemical industry: globally, <span class="emph">16% of oil is used to produce plastics, synthetic fibers, and fertilizers</span>, with demand growing at an average of <span class="emph">2.3% annually</span>—driven by fast fashion, food packaging, and electronic consumption, all deeply embedded in modern lifestyles.</p>
            <p>Oil is no longer just an energy source—it has become a <span class="emph">"metabolic necessity"</span> embedded in the very fabric of modernity. It sustains the fluidity of global supply chains, the mobility of urban sprawl, and the immediacy of consumer society. As the Fraunhofer Institute's <strong>"Triple Synchronization Model"</strong> suggests: <span class="highlight">the expansion of renewables, grid intelligence, and deep electrification in end-uses must progress in tandem</span>, or else we fall into a negative feedback loop of "greener means more oil."</p>
            <p>China's "Gobi Desert" wind and solar mega-bases, paired with ultra-high-voltage transmission and storage systems, achieved a utilization rate of <span class="emph">97%</span> in 2023—a model of systemic unlocking. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that if global storage investment grows at 25% annually through 2030, oil-based peak load demand could be reduced by <span class="emph">40%</span>.</p>
            <p>Yet the real challenge lies in the <span class="emph">conflict of time scales</span>: climate science demands a 45% emissions cut by 2030, but energy system transformation takes 30–50 years. We cannot skip systemic inertia, but we can <span class="emph">reshape the rhythm</span>—acknowledging oil's short-term irreplaceability in peaking, shipping, and chemicals, while accelerating its exit through carbon pricing, green hydrogen subsidies, and circular economy legislation.</p>
            <p>"Decoupling" is not an instant rupture, but a <span class="emph">carefully designed deceleration</span>: embedding transformation anchors within systemic inertia, and infusing confidence into security anxieties. Only by facing the paradox can we transcend it.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="transition">
            <strong>Transition: From "Technological Lock-in" to "Financial Lock-in" — When Oil Becomes a Settlement Asset</strong><br><br>
            Systemic inertia is difficult to break not only due to its technical complexity, but because it conceals a <span class="highlight">financial channel</span>: over 90% of global oil trade is denominated and settled in U.S. dollars, forming the "petrodollar" cycle of "oil → dollars → U.S. Treasury bonds." This mechanism transforms oil from a "commodity" into a "financial anchor," endowing it with power beyond its physical properties. When nations increase oil reserves amid energy security fears, they simultaneously <span class="highlight">reinforce dollar hegemony</span>—because reserves must be valued in dollars, and transactions rely on SWIFT.<br><br>
            Yet, it is precisely this "security-finance" entanglement that is sparking a countercurrent: the quiet rise of <strong>de-dollarized oil</strong>. The systemic inertia of energy transition thus resonates with the transformation of the global financial order. Oil's resilience no longer depends solely on its physical function, but on who controls the settlement channel. A silent monetary revolution is unfolding beneath the surface of the energy system.
        </div>

        <section>
            <h2>Second Deconstruction: Financial Channels — De-Dollarized Oil and the Reconfiguration of Geopolitical Power</h2>
            <h3>From "Petrodollars" to "Local Currency Settlement": The Awakening of Financial Channels</h3>
            <p>Since the 1974 "petrodollar" agreement between Saudi Arabia and the U.S., over 90% of global oil trade has been priced and settled in U.S. dollars, anchoring dollar hegemony to commodities. Yet in 2023, Saudi Arabia accepted <span class="emph">Chinese yuan</span> for part of its crude exports to China—marking a crack in the petrodollar system.</p>
            <p>This is not an isolated case:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>China's oil trade with Iran, Russia, and Venezuela now commonly uses yuan or local currencies. In 2023, <span class="emph">12%</span> of China's crude imports were paid in yuan—triple the 2020 level;</li>
                <li>After the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict, India used rupees to settle Russian oil imports, evading Western sanctions;</li>
                <li>The BRICS bloc, expanded to 10 members (with Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, UAE, and Saudi Arabia joining in 2024), now accounts for over <span class="emph">40% of global oil exports</span>, and is advancing a <span class="emph">local currency settlement network</span>, aiming for <span class="emph">80%</span> of intra-BRICS energy trade to be settled in local currencies by 2030.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Together, these actions point to a core logic: <span class="emph">energy power is shifting from "who controls the well" to "who controls the settlement channel"</span>. When oil trade no longer relies on the dollar-based SWIFT system, the dollar's monopoly as a "global public good" is weakened.</p>

            <h3>The Decentralization of Financial Channels: INSTEX, CIPS, and Multilateral Bridging</h3>
            <p>The essence of "de-dollarized oil" is <span class="emph">the parallelization of financial infrastructure</span>. Key examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>INSTEX</strong> (Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges): Established in 2019 by France, Germany, and the UK to sustain non-dollar trade with Iran. Though initially limited, it provided Europe with an institutional template for de-dollarization;</li>
                <li><strong>CIPS</strong> (Cross-Border Interbank Payment System): By 2023, CIPS had connected <span class="emph">182 countries</span>, processing over <span class="emph">500 billion yuan per day</span>—China's "financial expressway" for local currency settlement;</li>
                <li><strong>BRICS Payment System</strong> (BRICS Pay): Piloted in 2023, supporting digital currencies and local currency settlement among members, aiming to build a "de-dollarized multilateral clearing network."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These systems do not merely replace SWIFT; they enable <span class="emph">"bridging mechanisms"</span> for financial channel diversification—e.g., direct AED-CNY exchange, INR-RUB clearing in third markets like Singapore. <span class="highlight">Financial power is shifting from a "single center" to a "multi-node network"</span>, with energy trade as a key application.</p>

            <h3>Geopolitical Reconfiguration: From "Dollar-Security" to a "Multipolar Financial Order"</h3>
            <p>Dollar hegemony has long relied on the "petrodollar cycle": oil priced in dollars, petrodollars recycled into U.S. Treasuries, and the U.S. using financial dominance to maintain global security. Now, this closed loop is fracturing:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Security autonomy drives financial autonomy</strong>: Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, having diversified security ties post-Ukraine crisis, now seek deeper defense cooperation with China and Russia, providing political cover for yuan and ruble settlements;</li>
                <li><strong>Sanctions backlash spawns alternatives</strong>: U.S. financial sanctions on Russia exposed SWIFT's weaponization risks, accelerating the Global South's construction of "financial firewalls";</li>
                <li><strong>BRICS expansion reshapes the energy-finance axis</strong>: New members (e.g., Iran, Saudi Arabia) give BRICS control of nearly <span class="emph">50% of global proven oil reserves</span> and <span class="emph">40% of exports</span>. Once its local currency network matures, BRICS could form a parallel "energy-finance pole" to the G7.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Challenges and Limits: The Resilience of Dollar Hegemony</h3>
            <p>Despite the rising tide of de-dollarized oil, dollar hegemony remains resilient: the dollar accounts for <span class="emph">58% of global foreign exchange reserves</span> (IMF 2023), and remains the primary financing currency. But the key shift is: <span class="highlight">the dollar is transitioning from "the only option" to "one of many"</span>. When China, India, and Saudi Arabia establish "local currency first" mechanisms in energy trade, the dollar's usage scenarios are systematically narrowed.</p>
            <p>Even more profound: <span class="emph">energy power is no longer monopolized by a single nation, but defined collectively by "financial channel coalitions"</span>. The future global order may no longer be about "who has the oil," but "who controls settlement, clearing, and credit networks."</p>
        </section>

        <div class="transition">
            <strong>Transition: From "Financial Lock-in" to "Psychological Lock-in" — When Oil Becomes Cultural Subconscious</strong><br><br>
            While financial channel transformation can weaken dollar hegemony, if social psychology remains trapped in the "default settings" of oil-based modernity, the transition will remain superficial. We replace gas cars, but still consume plastic-packaged food, chase fast fashion, and race down highways.<br><br>
            Oil has long transcended its physical form to become a <span class="highlight">cultural subconscious</span>—internalized through daily practices like highways, plastics, and fast fashion, shaping an "addictive memory" in modern humans. This memory is harder to dismantle than technological inertia, and more difficult to replace than financial channels. The final battlefield of energy transition is not the power grid or the settlement system, but <span class="highlight">the human mind and soul</span>.
        </div>

        <section>
            <h2>Third Deconstruction: Addictive Memory — The Petrochemical Subconscious in Modern Psychological Structures</h2>
            <h3>Highways: The Neural Circuit of Speed Worship and Spatial Compression</h3>
            <p>Highways are the totem of modernity. From the U.S. Interstate System to China's "Eight Horizontal and Eight Vertical" high-speed rail network (still reliant on petroleum-based asphalt and machinery), highway systems reshape human spatial perception through <span class="emph">linearity, speed, and directness</span>. Sociologist David Harvey calls this "time-space compression"—geographic distance collapsed by velocity, the world "flattened."</p>
            <p>But this compression depends on the <span class="emph">"speed contract" of internal combustion engines and oil</span>: every press of the accelerator reaffirms the metabolism of oil. Psychological studies show that driving activates the brain's reward circuit, releasing dopamine, forming a "speed-control-pleasure" feedback loop. Highways thus become <span class="emph">addictive rituals</span>: every journey unconsciously repeats the metaphor "oil is freedom."</p>
            <p>Even deeper, this spatial experience fosters <span class="emph">individualized survival modes</span>. Private cars replace walking and public transit, urban sprawl depends on oil, and humans evolve from "community beings" to "wheel people." Oil becomes complicit in modern loneliness.</p>

            <h3>Plastics: The Illusion of Convenience and the Construction of the "Disposable Self"</h3>
            <p>Over <span class="emph">400 million tons</span> of plastic are produced annually, 99% derived from oil. From takeout containers to phone cases, plastics—<span class="emph">lightweight, cheap, non-biodegradable</span>—construct an "illusion of convenience," as if the world can be endlessly replicated and casually discarded.</p>
            <p>Social psychologists note that this "throwaway culture" fosters <span class="emph">psychological de-responsibilization</span>: consumption means ownership, disposal means release. We no longer form long-term relationships with objects, but treat them as replaceable "temporary organs." Plastic becomes the material embodiment of the modern <span class="emph">fragmented self</span>—we discard promises, relationships, and memories as easily as plastic bottles.</p>
            <p>More dangerously, this culture internalizes <span class="emph">linear thinking</span>: resources are inexhaustible, waste "out of sight, out of mind." Plastic is not just a material, but <span class="highlight">the excrement of modern psychological structure</span>—exposing our detachment from the future and objectification of nature.</p>

            <h3>Fast Fashion: The Fuel of Identity Anxiety and the Accelerator of Desire</h3>
            <p>Fast fashion is the product of oil-based synthetics (polyester, acrylic) and global logistics. In a Zara shirt's carbon footprint, <span class="emph">70% comes from petroleum-derived materials</span>. Through "weekly new arrivals" and "limited-time discounts," it pushes consumption frequency to extremes.</p>
            <p>Psychologically, fast fashion is <span class="emph">fuel for identity anxiety</span>. Consumption is not about need, but about constructing a "symbolic self." Fast fashion cheaply manufactures "fashion illusions," keeping individuals chasing the next "new me" in cycles of fleeting satisfaction. This cycle is essentially <span class="highlight">oil-driven identity addiction</span>—we wrap ourselves not in fabric, but in the desire to be seen.</p>
            <p>Deeper still, this model reinforces <span class="emph">immediate gratification preferences</span>, weakening delayed gratification. Neuroscience shows that frequent fast fashion consumption reduces prefrontal cortex activity, impairing long-term planning. Oil thus becomes a <span class="emph">chronic inhibitor of cognitive capacity</span>.</p>

            <h3>Deconstructing "Addictive Memory": The Psychological Revolution of Energy Transition</h3>
            <p>These three cultural practices—highways, plastics, fast fashion—together form oil's "addictive memory": it internalizes oil as the default setting of modernity through <span class="emph">sensory stimulation, identity construction, and spatial experience</span>.</p>
            <p>True transformation must be a <span class="emph">psychological revolution</span>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Rebuild a "slow-speed ethic"</strong>: through urban planning, public transit, and walkable design, restore "slowness" as a value;</li>
                <li><strong>Promote "material consciousness"</strong>: legislate against single-use plastics, promote biodegradable materials, and launch "material education";</li>
                <li><strong>Reframe "identity narratives"</strong>: replace "update, possess, own" with "durability, repair, sharing";</li>
                <li><strong>Develop "psychological detox" mechanisms</strong>: tools like carbon footprint labels and digital minimalism to help individuals identify and break oil-dependent mental habits.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>From Triple Deconstruction to Civilizational Rebirth</h2>
            <p>The triple deconstruction of oil reveals a profound truth: <span class="highlight">energy transition is not a technical issue, but a civilizational one</span>. Systemic inertia is its <span class="emph">body</span>, financial channels its <span class="emph">blood</span>, and addictive memory its <span class="emph">soul</span>. Together, they form a self-sustaining civilizational loop—only by deconstructing all three simultaneously can it be broken.</p>
            <p>We stand at a threshold: the climate crisis demands we <span class="emph">slow down</span>, yet modernity demands we <span class="emph">speed up</span>; the Global South yearns for financial autonomy, yet the dollar system remains entrenched; we call for sustainable living, yet our psychological structures remain addicted to immediacy.</p>
            <p>True civilizational rebirth is not about inventing more efficient batteries or safer nuclear plants, but about <span class="emph">rebuilding a way of life in sync with Earth's rhythms</span>—a new ethic of respecting matter, valuing time, and embracing relationships.</p>
            <p>When oil's status as a "metabolic necessity" is deconstructed, when financial channels are no longer monopolized by a single currency, and when "addictive memory" is replaced by "mindful practice," we gain not only carbon neutrality, but a <span class="highlight">new way of being</span>: from "metabolism" to "symbiosis," from "possession" to "sharing," from "acceleration" to "awareness."</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>This is the ultimate meaning of energy transition.<br>From triple deconstruction, to civilizational rebirth.</strong></p>
