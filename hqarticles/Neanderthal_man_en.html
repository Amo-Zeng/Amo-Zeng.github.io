            <h2>Neanderthals: Our Shared Ancestors and Witnesses to Evolution</h2>
            <p>In the long course of human evolution, Neanderthals are an inescapable presence. Their skeletal fossils are scattered across Europe and West Asia, their stone tools are found in archaeological sites, and their genetic sequences are hidden within our DNA. For a long time, we were told that Neanderthals had completely gone extinct, but the truth is far more complex. The bloodline of Neanderthals never truly vanished; instead, it continued in a subtle and profound way to the present day.</p>

            <h3>I. Genetic Code: The Eternal Mark of Neanderthals</h3>
            <p>In 2010, a groundbreaking genetic sequencing result shocked the scientific community: the genomes of modern Eurasians contain an average of about 2% Neanderthal DNA. This discovery overturned our understanding of human evolution: Neanderthals were not completely replaced but rather had genetic exchanges with Homo sapiens, passing their genetic code to us today.</p>
            <p>Archaeological evidence shows that around 60,000 years ago, Homo sapiens left Africa and entered Neanderthal territory. The two human species overlapped in their ecological niches, inevitably leading to contact. Scientific studies suggest that this genetic exchange may have lasted tens of thousands of years, until the disappearance of Neanderthals about 40,000 years ago.</p>

            <h3>II. Evolution's Gift: Neanderthal's Life-Giving Genes</h3>
            <p>The genes of Neanderthals not only remain in our DNA but also leave deep impressions on the physiology and health of modern humans. Research has found that some Neanderthal genes are related to our immune systems, skin diseases, and even susceptibility to depression.</p>
            <p>In terms of the immune system, Neanderthal genes help modern humans adapt better to cold climates and different pathogens. For example, the red hair gene is a gift from Neanderthals, closely related to skin pigmentation and vitamin D metabolism. Regarding mental health, some Neanderthal genes are believed to be associated with depression and addictive behaviors, possibly adaptive traits arising from long-term coexistence between the two human species.</p>

            <h3>III. Cultural Continuity: Neanderthal's Spiritual Legacy</h3>
            <p>Beyond the genetic level, Neanderthals also left a profound impact on the cultural level. Archaeological discoveries indicate that Neanderthals had complex cultural systems and social structures. They used pigments for artistic creation, held some form of funeral ceremonies, and possibly engaged in music and dance.</p>
            <p>These cultural traits likely influenced or inspired Homo sapiens in some way. During the genetic exchanges between the two human species, cultural exchanges and integrations were quietly occurring. While we cannot ascertain whether Neanderthal thoughts and art were inherited and developed by Homo sapiens, it is certain that the cultural interactions between the two human species laid the foundation for the birth of modern human civilization.</p>

            <h3>IV. Future Enlightenment: Reconciliation with Our "Cousins"</h3>
            <p>Acknowledging that Neanderthals did not truly disappear is, in fact, a profound reflection on human evolutionary history. It reminds us that evolution is not a simple process of replacement and elimination but a complex process of fusion. Neanderthals exist in our genome in a special way, becoming part of the human whole.</p>
            <p>This perception has profound social implications. It challenges anthropocentrism and prompts us to view different groups and cultures with more inclusiveness. In this sense, Neanderthals remain our "cousins," reminding us of the connections and interactions between different human groups during the evolutionary process.</p>

            <h3>V. The Slash Generation of the Ice Age: Neanderthal's Multiple Identities</h3>
            <p>In modern society, the "slash generation" refers to young people with multiple identities and skills. They are not content with single careers but pursue diversified development and showcase their talents in different fields. Surprisingly, there was such a group of "slash generation" in the distant Ice Age—the Neanderthals.</p>
            <p>Neanderthals, often considered as simple-minded and physically strong "barbarians," have had their perceptions overturned by recent archaeological discoveries and research. They were not primitive but rather a group of the "slash generation" with multiple identities and skills.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identity One: Master Technicians</strong> - Neanderthals were exceptional toolmakers.</li>
                <li><strong>Identity Two: Musicians</strong> - They created music using bone flutes in a cave in France.</li>
                <li><strong>Identity Three: Artists</strong> - They left exquisite cave paintings on the walls.</li>
                <li><strong>Identity Four: Warriors</strong> - They had robust physiques and excellent combat skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Identity Five: Tribal Members</strong> - They lived in small tribes with close connections.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The multiple identities and skills of Neanderthals show that they were not the "primitive humans" we imagined but rather a group of the "slash generation" with wisdom, creativity, and emotions. Like us, they pursued diversified development and showcased their talents in different fields.</p>

            <h3>VI. Empathetic Perspective: Writing the Epic of Human Evolution</h3>
            <p>Viewing Neanderthals as "us" rather than "them" is not only a respect for history but also a profound understanding of ourselves. Each of us carries Neanderthal blood, and their stories are our stories; their evolution is our shared evolutionary journey. This perception helps us transcend racial, cultural, and geographical boundaries, viewing humanity's past, present, and future with more inclusiveness and empathy.</p>
            <p>Let us abandon the binary opposition of "us" and "them" and view human history from a broader perspective. Neanderthals are not "them" but "us"—our shared ancestors and indispensable heroes in the epic of our evolution. Only by writing history with this empathetic mindset can we truly understand the essence of humanity and create a glorious chapter together in our future journey.</p>
