            <h3>Revolutionary Role of AI and ML in Drug Analysis</h3>
            <p>The application of AI and ML technologies in drug analysis is not just an optimization of traditional methods but a profound revolution. These technologies, by processing and analyzing vast amounts of chemical and biological data, can quickly identify potential drug candidate molecules, significantly shortening the drug discovery cycle. For instance, deep learning models can predict the biological activity of compounds, reducing cumbersome testing steps in the laboratory. Additionally, AI can simulate the interaction between drugs and targets within the body, enhancing the precision of drug design and thereby predicting its effects and possible side effects early in the development stage. The combination of AI and ML not only improves the efficiency of drug discovery but also enhances the scientific basis and predictability of drug design, providing new impetus for innovation in drug development.</p>

            <h3>Environmental Sustainability and Drug Analysis</h3>
            <p>In terms of environmental sustainability, the field of drug analysis is gradually reducing its reliance on harmful chemical reagents and exploring more environmentally friendly analytical methods. Solvent-free or low-solvent analysis techniques, such as Solid-Phase Microextraction (SPME) and electrochemical methods, not only reduce environmental pollution but also enhance operational safety. The application of biosensors, utilizing the specific binding of biomolecules to target substances, provides highly selective and sensitive detection methods, further reducing the need for chemical reagents. Additionally, the optimization of laboratory waste management through waste classification, efficient treatment technologies, and the adoption of energy-saving equipment, implements the circular economy concept, significantly lowering the environmental burden of drug analysis activities. These environmentally friendly technological innovations not only align with the principles of sustainable development but also present new opportunities for growth in the field of drug analysis.</p>
