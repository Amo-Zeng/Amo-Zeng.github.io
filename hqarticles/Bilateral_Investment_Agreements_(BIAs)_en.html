            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) are important tools for international economic cooperation, not only influencing the global economic landscape but also having profound impacts on areas such as environmental protection, the digital economy, and the internationalization of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This article will delve into the multiple impacts of BITs in these areas through case studies, discussions on challenges and opportunities, and predictions of future trends.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Bilateral Investment Treaties on Environmental Protection</h2>
            <h3>Case Studies</h3>
            <p>Successful cases demonstrate that BITs can promote environmental investments. For example, the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) between China and the EU includes clauses on sustainable development and environmental protection, driving the development of renewable energy and green infrastructure. The bilateral investment treaty between the US and Mexico also requires investment projects to comply with local environmental regulations, promoting the application of advanced environmental technologies.</p>
            <h3>Challenges and Opportunities</h3>
            <p>Despite successful cases, BITs also face many challenges in environmental protection. Firstly, how the clauses in the treaties affect environmental standards and enforcement is a key issue. Many treaties lack specific environmental protection clauses or have overly broad clauses that are difficult to enforce effectively. Additionally, dispute settlement mechanisms (ISDS) can have negative impacts on environmental protection, such as multinational corporations using ISDS to sue governments for economic losses caused by environmental policies.</p>
            <p>However, BITs also bring many opportunities. By including specific environmental protection clauses in the treaties, the transfer and application of environmental technologies can be promoted. For example, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the EU and Canada includes specific clauses on environmental protection, driving cooperation between the two countries in the environmental field.</p>
            <h3>Future Trends</h3>
            <p>In the future, BITs may include more specific environmental protection clauses to better balance economic development with environmental protection. The treaties may explicitly require investment projects to comply with international environmental standards and adopt advanced environmental technologies. Additionally, future treaties may strengthen enforcement of environmental protection, establish specialized environmental protection agencies and funds, and incorporate environmental protection considerations into dispute settlement mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Challenges and Opportunities of Bilateral Investment Treaties in the Digital Economy Era</h2>
            <h3>Characteristics of the Digital Economy</h3>
            <p>The rise of the digital economy is changing the global economic landscape. Compared to the traditional economy, the digital economy is characterized by cross-border data flow, platform economy, technology-driven, and a combination of globalization and localization.</p>
            <h3>Limitations of Existing Treaties</h3>
            <p>Existing BITs were mainly formulated in the context of the traditional economy and are inadequate in dealing with the new forms of investment and challenges posed by the digital economy. Specifically, existing treaties have limitations in areas such as data sovereignty and cross-border flow, regulation of the platform economy, protection of technological innovation, and network security and privacy protection.</p>
            <h3>Innovative Clauses</h3>
            <p>To meet the demands of the digital economy era, BITs need to introduce innovative clauses, such as clarifying rules on cross-border data flow and data sovereignty, formulating specific regulatory clauses for the platform economy, strengthening intellectual property protection for technological innovation, including specific clauses on network security and privacy protection, and establishing bilateral cooperation and coordination mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Bilateral Investment Treaties on SMEs</h2>
            <h3>Challenges of SME Internationalization</h3>
            <p>In the process of globalization, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face numerous challenges, such as market access and legal risks. Different countries and regions have varying market access conditions, and SMEs may lack sufficient resources and experience to cope with these complex requirements.</p>
            <h3>Supportive Role of Treaties</h3>
            <p>BITs play a crucial role in supporting the internationalization of SMEs. Firstly, BITs provide legal guarantees, offering a more stable and predictable environment for SMEs' overseas investments. Secondly, BITs reduce trade barriers, helping SMEs enter international markets more smoothly.</p>
            <h3>Policy Recommendations</h3>
            <p>Although BITs provide important support for the internationalization of SMEs, there are still many areas for further improvement. Governments and relevant agencies can provide more information and consulting services, establish specialized support mechanisms, strengthen international cooperation, and offer training and education to help SMEs better utilize BITs.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Bilateral Investment Treaties have profound impacts on areas such as environmental protection, the digital economy, and the internationalization of SMEs. By including specific environmental protection clauses in the treaties, strengthening enforcement, and incorporating environmental protection considerations into dispute settlement mechanisms, a better balance between economic development and environmental protection can be achieved. Additionally, to meet the demands of the digital economy era, BITs need to introduce innovative clauses related to data sovereignty and cross-border flow, regulation of the platform economy, protection of technological innovation, and network security and privacy protection. Lastly, by providing legal guarantees and reducing trade barriers, BITs can significantly lower the risks and costs for SMEs in the internationalization process. Only in this way can BITs truly become powerful tools for promoting sustainable development and global economic prosperity.</p>
