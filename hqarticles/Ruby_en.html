            <h2>Ruby and Modern Web Development: The Synergy of JAMstack and Ruby</h2>
            <h3>JAMstack: A New Paradigm in Modern Web Development</h3>
            <p>JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) is a modern web development architecture that focuses on building web applications using pre-built static files and APIs. The three core components of JAMstack include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: Used for handling dynamic content and interactions on the client side.</li>
                <li><strong>APIs</strong>: Used for handling backend logic and data operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Markup</strong>: Pre-built static HTML files used to provide content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The advantages of JAMstack lie in its high performance, security, and scalability. Since static files can be served directly from a CDN (Content Delivery Network), the loading speed is extremely fast. Additionally, because backend logic is handled through APIs, JAMstack applications can be easily scaled and maintained.</p>
            <h3>The Role of Ruby: Building Efficient and Secure APIs</h3>
            <p>Although JAMstack primarily relies on frontend technologies, the implementation of backend logic remains crucial. Ruby and its powerful web frameworks (such as Sinatra and Hanami) excel in building efficient and secure APIs, providing robust backend support for JAMstack applications.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Handling Complex Business Logic</strong>: Ruby is known for its concise and elegant syntax, which allows developers to write and maintain complex business logic more efficiently. For example, the Sinatra framework provides a lightweight environment for web application development, enabling developers to quickly build APIs. The Hanami framework, on the other hand, offers a more comprehensive MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, suitable for building large and complex web applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Persistence</strong>: Ruby on Rails (RoR) is one of the most famous web frameworks in Ruby, and it comes with a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool called ActiveRecord, which makes data persistence simple and efficient. With ActiveRecord, developers can easily interact with databases, perform complex queries, and handle transactions. This provides reliable data support for JAMstack applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Security</strong>: Security is a critical aspect of web development. Ruby and its frameworks offer various security mechanisms to protect applications from common security threats. For example, the Rails framework includes built-in CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection, SQL injection prevention, and password encryption. Additionally, the Ruby community is active, continuously updating and improving security libraries to ensure the security of applications.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Case Studies: The Synergy of Ruby and JAMstack</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shopify</strong>: Shopify is a leading global e-commerce platform that uses JAMstack architecture for its frontend and Ruby on Rails for its backend. Shopify provides high-performance static pages through JAMstack, while using Rails to build powerful APIs that handle complex business logic and data operations. This architecture not only improves application performance but also ensures system scalability and security.</li>
                <li><strong>GitHub Pages + Jekyll</strong>: GitHub Pages is a free static website hosting service that supports generating static pages using Jekyll, a static site generator written in Ruby. Many developers and organizations use GitHub Pages and Jekyll to build personal blogs, project documentation, and small websites. With Jekyll, developers can easily generate static pages and write custom plugins and templates in Ruby to achieve more complex functionalities.</li>
                <li><strong>Netlify + Ruby on Rails</strong>: Netlify is a popular JAMstack platform that supports the deployment and management of static websites. Many developers use Netlify to host JAMstack applications while leveraging Ruby on Rails to build backend APIs. This combination not only provides a high-performance frontend experience but also ensures efficient and secure backend logic.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Application of Ruby in Data Science and Machine Learning</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>In the fields of data science and machine learning, Python is undoubtedly the most mainstream programming language. It has a rich set of libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, which greatly simplify the processes of data processing, model training, and deployment. However, this does not mean that other programming languages have no place in these fields. Ruby, a language known for its simplicity and elegance, may not be as widely used in data science and machine learning as Python, but its unique advantages make it valuable in certain scenarios.</p>
            <h3>Ruby Data Science Libraries</h3>
            <p>Although Ruby's data science libraries are not as extensive as Python's, there are still some high-quality libraries that can meet basic data processing, statistical analysis, and machine learning needs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Numo::NArray</strong>: This is a library similar to NumPy, used for handling multi-dimensional arrays. Numo::NArray provides efficient array operations and mathematical calculations, serving as a foundational library for numerical computing in Ruby.</li>
                <li><strong>Daru</strong>: Daru (Data Analysis in Ruby) is a library for data processing and analysis, similar to Pandas. It provides two data structures, DataFrame and Series, and supports data cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis. Daru also seamlessly integrates with Numo::NArray, making data processing more efficient.</li>
                <li><strong>SciRuby</strong>: SciRuby is a collection of multiple sub-projects aimed at providing tools for scientific computing and data analysis in Ruby.</li>
            </ul>
