If you're referring to the term **"æ•°ç”²"** in an educational or exam context (e.g., in Taiwanâ€™s college entrance exams), the English translation would typically be:

ðŸ‘‰ **"Mathematics A"** or **"Math A"**

This refers to one of the math exam levels in the **University Subject Ability Test (å­¸ç§‘èƒ½åŠ›æ¸¬é©—)**. There are usually two levels:

- **æ•¸ç”² (Mathematics A)** â€” more advanced, often required for STEM-related majors.
- **æ•¸ä¹™ (Mathematics B)** â€” less advanced, often for non-STEM fields.

So:

### âœ… "æ•°ç”²" â†’ **Mathematics A** or **Math A**

Let me know if you meant something different by "æ•°ç”²" â€” there could be other meanings depending on the context!
