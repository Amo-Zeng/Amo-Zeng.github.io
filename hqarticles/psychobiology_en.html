            <h2>I. The Epigenetics Perspective in Psychobiology</h2>
            <p>Epigenetics explores how environmental factors influence biological behaviors and mental states by altering gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. From a psychobiological perspective, epigenetics can explain how psychological stress, childhood trauma, or social environments affect brain development and mental health through epigenetic mechanisms. For instance, chronic stress may lead to elevated methylation levels of certain genes, affecting neurotransmitter production and leading to mental issues such as depression. Through epigenetic research, we can uncover the underlying biological mechanisms of mental health problems and explore preventive and intervention strategies arising from this knowledge.</p>

            <h2>II. The Gut-Brain Axis Perspective in Psychobiology</h2>
            <p>The gut-brain axis is an emerging perspective in psychobiology, studying the bidirectional interaction between the gut microbiome and brain function. The gut is considered the "second brain," and its microbiome influences emotions, cognition, and behavior through neural, immune, and metabolic pathways. For example, gut microbiota can directly or indirectly modulate brain function by secreting neurotransmitters or hormones. By researching the gut-brain axis, we can reveal associations between mental health issues (such as anxiety and depression) and gut health, and explore the possibility of improving mental health by regulating the gut microbiome.</p>

            <h2>III. The Circadian Rhythm Perspective in Psychobiology</h2>
            <p>Circadian rhythm is the internal time-keeping system of organisms, affecting sleep, mood, and behavior. Psychobiology can reveal the rhythmic basis of mental health issues (such as sleep disorders and seasonal affective disorder) through circadian rhythm research. For instance, circadian rhythm disruption may impact the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to anxiety and depression. Additionally, conflicts between circadian rhythms and social environments (such as the 24-hour work and entertainment patterns of modern society) may exacerbate psychological stress. By studying the association between circadian rhythms and mental health, we can develop rhythm-based psychological intervention strategies to improve overall mental health.</p>
