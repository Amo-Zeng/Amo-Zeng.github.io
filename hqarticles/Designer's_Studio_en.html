Translate the following web content into English:

<think>  
Alright, I now need to process two texts provided by the user: the first is a blog post about artificial intelligence and data privacy, and the second is a translation task for an article on interdisciplinary design. However, it seems the user may not have directly requested a translation but instead provided two texts, possibly needing help with analysis or addressing a specific issue within them. Let me carefully review the user's question description.  

The user's initial query was: "Okay, I need to translate an English article about interdisciplinary design into Chinese, and I want the translated content to be conversational and easy to understand while retaining the original professional terminology to ensure technical accuracy. Additionally, the user mentioned they would provide the original text and their attempted translation, possibly for me to compare and improve."  

But then the user provided two texts: the first is a Chinese blog post about AI and data privacy (including HTML code), and the second is an English article on interdisciplinary design, though it appears truncated with an ellipsis. It seems the user may want me to translate the interdisciplinary design part, but the provided text might be incomplete or formatted incorrectly.  

Now, I need to confirm the user's specific request. The user might have made an error while testing or providing examples, resulting in only a small portion of the second text, while the first is an HTML blog post about AI and privacy. It’s possible the user wants the HTML blog post translated into another language or part of the English text translated into Chinese.  

Alternatively, the user might have misoperated, leading to an incomplete question description. In this case, how should I respond?  

As an assistant, I should infer based on all the information provided. The user mentioned a translation need for interdisciplinary design, wanting it to be conversational, easy to understand, and retaining terminology and technical details. However, of the two texts currently provided, the first is a Chinese blog, and the second is a partial English article.  

Perhaps the user wants the English interdisciplinary article (though truncated) translated into Chinese, with the HTML content serving as an example or for another purpose. Or maybe the user wants me to analyze or combine the two in some way.  

In this situation, the correct approach is to clarify the user's specific needs. But since I can’t ask, I’ll have to provide assistance based on the existing information.  

According to the user’s initial instructions, they need an English article about interdisciplinary design translated into Chinese, possibly with prior attempts. The provided English paragraph might be part of the article, so it needs translation into Chinese. Although the paragraph is interrupted by an ellipsis, I should handle this portion while ensuring technical terms are accurately preserved.  

During translation, I’ll aim for a conversational tone—for example, translating "interdisciplinary collaboration" as "跨学科合作" while maintaining professional accuracy. The structure and information integrity should also be preserved.  

For example, the provided English paragraph:  
"Designers often have to operate across different domains to integrate new knowledge systems. This process can be characterized as ‘interdisciplinary design,’ which goes beyond just collaboration; it involves the synthesis of diverse areas such as engineering, art, and business. However, the implementation of interdisciplinary projects often requires more than just assembling a cross-functional team. It demands a deliberate process of aligning differing terminologies, methodologies, and goals. For instance, a designer working on a medical device might need to understand the clinical workflows of healthcare professionals while communicating effectively with engineers and product managers to ensure the design meets technical and market requirements. Such projects necessitate a hybrid skill set that merges the designer’s traditional toolkit with new competencies in systems thinking..."  

Translated into conversational Chinese while retaining accurate terminology:  
"设计师通常需要跨越不同领域来整合新的知识体系。这一过程可以被称为‘跨学科设计’，它不仅仅是协作，更涉及工程、艺术和商业等领域的综合。然而，跨学科项目的实施不仅仅需要组建一个跨职能团队。它还要求有意识地统一不同的术语、方法和目标。例如，设计师在开发医疗设备时，可能需要了解医疗专业人员的临床工作流程，同时与工程师和产品经理有效沟通，以确保设计符合技术和市场要求。这类项目需要一种混合技能，将设计师的传统工具与系统思维等新能力相结合。"  

I need to verify if the terminology is correct—for example, whether "interdisciplinary design" is appropriately translated as "跨学科设计" and "clinical workflows" as "临床工作流程"—and whether adjustments are needed to make the expression more conversational.  

Additionally, the user might want the HTML blog post translated into another language. But based on the question description, the primary need is English-to-Chinese translation, so I should focus on the interdisciplinary design portion.  

In summary, the user needs the English paragraph on interdisciplinary design translated into Chinese, ensuring it’s conversational, easy to understand, and retains professional terminology and technical accuracy. I should translate the provided English content accordingly while ensuring quality.

Below is the translated interdisciplinary design content as requested, using conversational Chinese while preserving professional terminology and technical details:  

Designers often need to operate across different domains to synthesize new knowledge systems. This process is referred to as "interdisciplinary design," which goes beyond mere collaboration—it requires the integration and innovation of diverse fields such as engineering, art, and business. But to truly implement such projects, simply assembling a cross-functional team is far from enough. The project team must systematically plan: unify professional terminology, integrate different research methods, and reconcile the goals of all stakeholders. Take the example of medical device design: designers must understand the clinical workflows of healthcare professionals while efficiently communicating with engineers and product managers to ensure the design meets both technical specifications and market demands. Such projects demand that designers master hybrid skills—combining traditional design tools with new competencies like systems thinking.  

(Translation notes: Retained professional terms like "interdisciplinary design" (跨学科设计) and "clinical workflows" (临床工作流程), used conversational phrases like "reconcile the goals of all stakeholders" (调和各方目标) to enhance readability, improved information absorption through paragraph breaks, and maintained the structural integrity of the original text.)
