            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The transition from "seeking" to "being discovered," from "single signal" to "multidimensional data," and from "scientific exploration" to "cultural dissemination" is not only a new exploration for the SETI project but also a profound reflection on the future modes of cosmic communication and the development of scientific culture for humanity. By actively broadcasting and optimizing signals, we can increase the likelihood of being discovered by extraterrestrial civilizations; by integrating and analyzing multidimensional data, we can construct a more comprehensive "profile of extraterrestrial civilizations," thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of SETI research; by strengthening public participation and cultural dissemination
