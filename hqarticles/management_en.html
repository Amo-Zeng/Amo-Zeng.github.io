            <h2>Management Roles and Challenges in Modern Enterprises: Reconstructing Leadership and Innovation Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>In today's rapidly changing business environment, a company's success no longer relies solely on traditional management models but requires management with deeper leadership, flexibility, adaptability, and innovation capabilities.

            <h3>I. From "Controller" to "Facilitator": Building an Innovation Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>For a long time, management has played the role of rule-maker and execution supervisor in enterprises. With the rapid iteration of technology and the complexity of the market environment, the traditional control-oriented management model can no longer cope with the rapid changes and innovation needs of enterprises. Management needs to transition from "controllers" to "facilitators" and build an open, inclusive, error-tolerant, and collaborative innovation ecosystem.</p>
