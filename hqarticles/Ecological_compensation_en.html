        <h2>Reconstructing Cross-Civilizational Compensation Ethics from the Perspective of Climate Debt</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <p>As the global climate crisis deepens, traditional ecological compensation mechanisms are facing fundamental challenges. The Western compensation model, centered on market transactions and economic payments, essentially operates on a logic of "purchasing ecological services," overlooking historical responsibility, cultural differences, and structural inequalities between civilizations. Against this backdrop, the <strong>reconstruction of cross-civilizational compensation ethics</strong> from the perspective of <strong>climate debt</strong> proposes elevating ecological compensation from mere "transactions" to "civilizational-level restitution." Grounded in the profound <strong>reciprocal view of nature</strong> from the Global South, this approach advocates a profound transformation of global ecological governance toward shared responsibility, cultural respect, and historical justice.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>I. The Reciprocal View of Nature: A Philosophical Deconstruction of Western Instrumental Rationality</h2>
            <p>The Western ecological compensation framework is built upon the dichotomy between subject and object and anthropocentrism, treating nature as a quantifiable resource pool, where compensation becomes the outcome of cost-benefit calculations. In contrast, civilizations of the Global South offer a fundamentally different ethical paradigm:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Africa's Ubuntu philosophy</strong> emphasizes "I am because we are," viewing humans, nature, and ancestors as an inseparable life community;</li>
                <li><strong>Latin America's Buen Vivir (Good Living)</strong> opposes growth-at-all-costs, advocating for social well-being within ecological limits;</li>
                <li><strong>East Asia's "harmony between heaven and humanity"</strong> manifests as reverence and restraint toward nature, emphasizing "following the way of nature."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These philosophies collectively pose three challenges to the Western compensation paradigm:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Relationality over instrumentality</strong>—nature is not a "service provider" but a "co-inhabitant";</li>
                <li><strong>Responsibility precedes rights</strong>—compensation is not "purchase" but "restitution";</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural subjectivity is non-transferable</strong>—ecological governance must respect local knowledge and civilizational autonomy.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This "reciprocal view of nature" demands that compensation mechanisms transcend economic logic and enter into deep ethical and civilizational dialogue.</p>

            <h2>II. Climate Debt: From Transaction to Civilizational Restitution with Shared Responsibility</h2>
            <p>"Climate debt" is not merely an economic concept, but a <strong>composite of historical justice, ecological ethics, and civilizational responsibility</strong>. Since the Industrial Revolution, Northern nations have accumulated wealth through high-carbon development while shifting the climatic costs onto the Global South—constituting a civilizational-scale "ecological appropriation." Therefore, ecological compensation must shift from "who pays" to "who is responsible," from "market transaction" to "civilizational restitution."</p>
            <p>This logic demands a threefold reconstruction:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Temporal justice</strong>: compensation must trace back to historical emissions since the 19th century, acknowledging the historical reality of "carbon colonialism";</li>
                <li><strong>Spatial shared responsibility</strong>: liability should not be bilateral, but distributed across civilizations through global mechanisms (e.g., a "Global Ecological Responsibility Fund");</li>
                <li><strong>Value pluralism</strong>: compensation forms should include technology sharing, development rights concessions, cultural recognition, and institutional empowerment—not merely monetary payments.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>III. Practical Pathways: Embedding Ethics in Transboundary Governance</h2>
            <p>Consider the fictional case of the <strong>Ganges-Thames Climate Responsibility Initiative</strong>: India's Ganges Basin sequesters 120 million tons of carbon annually through forest conservation, yet faces energy poverty. The UK, as a historically high-emission nation, commits to compensation based on "climate debt weighting." Rather than carbon pricing, a <strong>Civilizational Responsibility Package</strong> is established:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The UK transfers clean coal technology to India (avoiding a repeat of high-carbon development);</li>
                <li>Funding is provided for a Himalayan community ecological monitoring network;</li>
                <li>Support is given to cultural initiatives like the "Ganges Ecology Festival."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Funds are overseen by a <strong>Trans-Civilizational Climate Council</strong>, ensuring Southern communities have decision-making authority.</p>
            <p>In <strong>international carbon markets</strong>, a "Civilizational Equity Adjustment Factor" could be introduced—high historical emitters must pay an additional 10% "responsibility premium" per ton of carbon credits purchased, funding solar projects in African communities. In <strong>climate aid</strong>, "cultural respect clauses" could be added; for example, when the EU aids Indonesia's peatland restoration, it must adopt local "forest guardian" traditional knowledge systems instead of imposing Western monitoring standards.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>IV. Structural Barriers and Civilizational Responses</h2>
            <p>This model faces significant challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Neocolonial risks</strong>—the North may impose technologies or institutions under the guise of "responsibility," such as demanding Southern nations adopt specific environmental standards in exchange for funding;</li>
                <li><strong>Sovereignty conflicts</strong>—nations may reject external liability determinations, questioning the legitimacy of historical emission data or compensation mechanisms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Responses must embody civilizational wisdom:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Decentralized responsibility accounting</strong>: the UN should establish a "Trans-Civilizational Climate Debt Commission" including indigenous representatives, Southern philosophers, and climate scientists, ensuring assessments are pluralistic and transparent;</li>
                <li><strong>Protection of cultural sovereignty</strong>: compensation agreements must include "knowledge sovereignty clauses," recognizing the legal status of traditional ecological knowledge;</li>
                <li><strong>Global judicialization</strong>: advocate for a "Climate Justice Convention" and establish an international climate court, making climate debt enforceable and preventing the "hollowing out" of responsibility.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The settlement of climate debt is, at its core, a rebalancing of civilizations. Only by grounding ethics in the reciprocal view of nature and practicing shared responsibility can we transcend the narrow logic of "compensation as transaction" and rebuild <strong>global justice</strong> amid the climate crisis. This is not merely institutional innovation, but civilizational reconciliation—facing ecological limits, humanity must learn to replace "possession" with "coexistence," and respond to "appropriation" with "restitution," ultimately achieving deep reconciliation between humans and nature, and among civilizations themselves.</p>
