            <p>In today's increasingly complex and uncertain global environment, supply chain disruptions have become a significant challenge for businesses. Geopolitical events, natural disasters, and pandemics continuously increase supply chain risks, forcing enterprises to re-examine their inventory management strategies to ensure business continuity and resilience. For example, the U.S.-China trade war led to increased tariffs, increasing import costs and supply chain uncertainty. The 2011 earthquake in Japan caused global chip shortages, affecting the production of the automotive and electronics industries. The COVID-19 pandemic left many enterprises facing raw material shortages and order backlogs.</p>
            <h4>2. Different Types of Resilient Inventory Strategies</h4>
            <p>Enterprises can respond to supply chain disruptions through strategies such as multi-sourcing, geographically dispersed warehouses, and inventory buffers. For example, automakers may procure key components from multiple countries to deal with supply issues in specific regions. Amazon has established multiple logistics centers around the world to meet logistics needs and potential disruption risks in different regions. Pharmaceutical companies may increase inventory of critical drugs during a pandemic to meet a surge in market demand.</p>
            <h4>3. Industry Case Studies of Successful Implementation of Resilient Inventory Strategies</h4>
            <p>Apple has always been at the forefront of supply chain management. Through multi-sourcing strategies, Apple procures key components such as chips and displays from multiple suppliers to reduce reliance on a single supplier. Additionally, Apple has established multiple production bases and logistics centers globally to ensure production and shipping can continue if a supply chain disruption occurs in one region. Walmart has successfully responded to multiple supply chain disruptions through geographically dispersed warehouses and inventory buffer strategies. For example, during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Walmart used its multiple warehouses in the affected areas to quickly restore the supply chain and provide essential supplies to the affected communities. Pfizer ensured sufficient supply of raw materials and production equipment necessary for vaccine production during the COVID-19 pandemic through multi-sourcing and inventory buffers.</p>

            <h3>Leveraging Blockchain Technology for Supply Chain Transparency and Inventory Accuracy</h3>
            <h4>1. How Blockchain Technology Works</h4>
            <p>Blockchain technology is a data storage and management method based on distributed ledger technology, achieving data security, transparency, and tamper-proof records through a decentralized mechanism. The core of blockchain consists of a series of data blocks called "blocks," each containing a certain number of transaction records. Each time a new block is created; these transactions are encrypted and linked to the previous block, forming an unalterable historical record chain. The basic working principles of blockchain can be divided into several key steps: transaction initiation, transaction verification, block creation and addition, consensus mechanism, and data storage and transparency.</p>
            <h4>2. Application of Blockchain Technology in Inventory Management</h4>
            <p>The application of blockchain technology in inventory management can significantly enhance supply chain transparency and data accuracy. Through blockchain, every transaction and inventory change is permanently recorded on the chain, and any authorized user can real-time view and verify this information, thereby effectively preventing human errors and data tampering. First, blockchain technology helps achieve precise inventory tracking. In traditional inventory management systems, inventory data is usually stored in different systems or databases, easily resulting in data silos. Through blockchain, every record of inventory in and out, changes in inventory levels can be updated and recorded on the chain in real-time, and all related parties can view the latest inventory data at any time. Second, blockchain can be used to verify the true origin of products. In complex supply chains, the origin and authenticity of goods are often difficult to verify, and counterfeit and shoddy goods can easily enter the market. Through blockchain, every stage of production, processing, transportation, and sales of goods can be recorded and tracked. Additionally, blockchain technology can improve supply chain transparency. In traditional supply chain systems, information is often scattered and opaque, and information asymmetry between different stages of enterprises leads to low supply chain efficiency and easy disputes. Through blockchain, all transactions and information in the supply chain are recorded on a public ledger, and all participants can real-time view and verify this information, enhancing the transparency and collaboration efficiency of the entire supply chain.</p>
            <h4>3. Case Studies: Blockchain Implementation by Walmart and Maersk</h4>
            <p>As one of the largest retailers in the world, Walmart's supply chain management faces enormous challenges. Traditional supply chain systems are information-scattered and data-update-lag, leading to low inventory management and product traceability efficiency. To address these issues, Walmart began introducing blockchain technology in 2017, particularly in food supply chain management as a pilot. Walmart's blockchain pilot project initially focused on fresh food. The company cooperated with IBM to develop and implement a blockchain platform based on Hyperledger Fabric. Pilot results showed that the application of blockchain technology significantly improved Walmart's supply chain transparency and inventory accuracy. During the pilot, through the blockchain platform, Walmart could trace the origin of food within minutes, while traditional methods took several days. Maersk, as a leading global shipping company, involves multiple ports and logistics companies worldwide in its supply chain management. Traditional shipping supply chain systems are complex and data-opaque, leading to low cargo tracking and inventory management efficiency. To address these issues, Maersk cooperated with IBM to launch the world's first shipping blockchain platform, TradeLens. The TradeLens platform is built on Hyperledger Fabric, used to record and verify various transactions and logistics information in the global shipping supply chain. Implementation results showed that TradeLens significantly improved Maersk's supply chain transparency and inventory management efficiency. For example, on the TradeLens platform, the customs clearance time of goods was greatly reduced from days to hours, which reduced logistics costs and inventory retention time.</p>
            <h4>4. Comparison Between Blockchain Technology and Other Inventory Management Technologies</h4>
            <p>In the field of inventory management, in addition to blockchain technology, many other management methods and technologies are widely applied, such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud-based data storage. RFID technology transmits data through radio waves to achieve real-time tracking and identification of items.
