            <h3>Current Analysis: Limitations of the Current Tax System and Opportunities for Reform</h3>
            <p>The current tax system still faces numerous challenges in supporting the development of SMEs, regulating income distribution, and promoting green transformation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tax Challenges for SMEs Development:</strong> The unified tax rate and tax incentives do not fully address the unique needs of SMEs at different stages of development.</li>
                <li><strong>Ineffectiveness of Personal Income Tax Regulation:</strong> The single progressive tax rate structure is unable to adapt to the reality of diversified income sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Shortcomings of the Environmental Protection Tax System:</strong> The narrow scope of the environmental protection tax and the low tax rates make it difficult to comprehensively address complex pollution issues.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>New Approach: Building a Comprehensive, Diversified, and Green Tax System</h3>
            <p>Tax reform should focus on the following aspects:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Establishing a "Incubation-Growth-Exit" Tax Support System:</strong> Guided by the life cycle of enterprises, provide targeted tax incentives.</li>
                <li><strong>Developing a Diversified Personal Income Tax System:</strong> Move away from a single tax rate mindset to adapt to the reality of diversified income sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Creating a "Green Tax System":</strong> Expand the scope of the environmental protection tax, set differentiated tax rates, and promote green development.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Tax reform is not just an optimization of economic regulation tools but also a profound response to the needs of SME development, income distribution fairness, and environmental protection. By building a comprehensive tax support system, a diversified personal income tax system, and a "green tax system," tax reform will provide SMEs with broader development opportunities, reduce income disparities, and promote green development.</p>
