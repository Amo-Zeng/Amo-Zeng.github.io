        <h2>The "Cultural Algorithm" Hypothesis of Neuroplasticity: Social Norms as Endogenous Neural Regulatory Programs</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <p>In neuropsychology, neuroplasticity is typically understood as the shaping of brain structure by individual experience. However, traditional models overlook how social norms—structural forces at the cultural level—become embedded in neural development through an "algorithmic" process. This paper proposes the <strong>"Cultural Algorithm"</strong> hypothesis: social norms, through prolonged social learning, are internalized as <strong>prior constraints on individual neuroplasticity</strong>, analogous to architectural biases in artificial intelligence (e.g., the attention mechanism in Transformers), thereby shaping functional brain connectivity and behavioral strategies.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>I. Theoretical Framework of the "Cultural Algorithm"</h2>
            <p>The "Cultural Algorithm" hypothesis treats culture as a <strong>neurally encoded meta-program</strong>, with its core mechanism being <strong>norm internalization</strong>—the process by which individuals, during socialization, transform social rules (e.g., collectivism vs. individualism, authority obedience vs. egalitarian negotiation) into neural processing biases. This process parallels "prior injection" in AI training: just as Transformer models acquire attentional biases for linguistic structure through pre-training, the human brain develops <strong>neural processing priorities</strong> for specific social contexts through social interactions during childhood.</p>
            <p>Findings from cultural neuroscience demonstrate that cultural differences manifest systematically in neural activity. Computational modeling further reveals that these differences can be explained as <strong>variations in Bayesian priors</strong>. In collectivist cultures, individuals show heightened sensitivity to prediction errors related to group harmony, reflected in increased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) reactivity to social conflict; in individualist cultures, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) exhibits stronger monitoring of deviations from personal goals. These prior differences are not genetically determined but are instead "written" into the brain during critical neuroplastic windows via <strong>social learning algorithms</strong> (e.g., imitation, reinforcement, punishment).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>II. The Default Mode Network (DMN) and Neural Pathways of Cultural Encoding</h2>
            <p>The Default Mode Network (DMN) serves as the central substrate of the "Cultural Algorithm." Cross-cultural fMRI studies reveal that in self-referential tasks, East Asian participants show stronger DMN activation (e.g., in the posterior cingulate cortex [PCC] and medial prefrontal cortex [mPFC]) for the "social self" (e.g., "who I am" in relation to family and social roles), whereas Western participants show greater activation for the "individual self" (e.g., "my traits"). This indicates that <strong>cultural norms reshape the content of self-representation within the DMN</strong>.</p>
            <p>More deeply, cultural differences emerge in the coupling patterns between the DMN and external networks: in collectivist cultures, the DMN exhibits stronger functional connectivity with the <strong>social cognition network</strong> (e.g., temporoparietal junction [TPJ]), supporting a "contextualized self"; in individualist cultures, the DMN couples more closely with the <strong>goal-directed network</strong> (e.g., dlPFC), supporting a "decontextualized self." These differences emerge in childhood and intensify with prolonged cultural exposure, indicating that the "Cultural Algorithm" has <strong>developmental dependency</strong>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>III. Cultural Regulation Pathways via the Prefrontal-Limbic System</h2>
            <p>Social norms also regulate emotional processing through prefrontal-limbic (PFC-amygdala) connectivity. Research shows that East Asians, during social evaluation tasks, exhibit <strong>stronger ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) inhibition of the amygdala</strong>, reflecting the internalization of "emotional restraint" norms; Westerners, in contrast, rely more on dlPFC-mediated "cognitive reappraisal," reflecting a cultural preference for "emotional expression." This difference is particularly evident in cross-cultural adoption studies: children adopted into different cultural environments develop PFC-amygdala connectivity patterns closer to those of their adoptive culture, rather than their birth culture.</p>
            <p>The "Cultural Algorithm" hypothesis further predicts that social norms are internalized via the <strong>dopamine-synapse plasticity pathway</strong>. For example, in cultures emphasizing "obedience to authority," children receiving social rewards (e.g., praise) for compliance activate the striatal dopamine system, reinforcing associated neural pathways; repeated exposure turns these pathways into "default circuits," forming culture-specific <strong>neural response baselines</strong>.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>IV. Research Design: Cross-Cultural fMRI + Longitudinal Tracking + Computational Modeling</h2>
            <p>To test this hypothesis, we propose the <strong>"NeuroCulture-Track"</strong> study:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sample</strong>: Recruit 100 six-year-old children (50 East Asian, 50 Western) for a 5-year longitudinal follow-up;</li>
                <li><strong>fMRI Tasks</strong>: Self-referential processing, social evaluation, norm violation judgment, measuring DMN and PFC-amygdala connectivity;</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Measures</strong>: Social norm internalization scales, cultural values questionnaires;</li>
                <li><strong>Computational Modeling</strong>: Construct a <strong>hierarchical Bayesian model</strong> using cultural values as priors to predict neural responses;</li>
                <li><strong>Social Computing</strong>: Use social media data (e.g., family conversation transcripts) to quantify cultural exposure intensity, analyzing its correlation with neural development.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Prediction</strong>: Cultural values (e.g., individualism scores) will significantly predict the developmental slope of DMN-PFC connectivity (p &lt; 0.001), with this predictive power remaining significant after controlling for socioeconomic status (SES). If the model's fit (BIC) outperforms purely biological models, it will support the "Cultural Algorithm" hypothesis.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>V. Practical Implications: Cross-Cultural Psychological Intervention and Educational AI</h2>
            <p>This hypothesis holds profound implications for applied research. First, <strong>cross-cultural psychological interventions should target the "Cultural Algorithm"</strong>: in collectivist cultures, depression treatment could strengthen individual self-narratives to disrupt over-coupling with the "social self"; in individualist cultures, enhancing social connectedness may be more effective. Second, <strong>educational AI must be "culturally adaptive"</strong>: AI tutoring systems should dynamically adjust feedback strategies (e.g., collectivist cultures emphasizing "we," individualist cultures emphasizing "you") to match students' neural-cognitive preferences.</p>
            <p>More forward-looking, future AI education platforms could leverage the "Cultural Algorithm" model to monitor students' real-time neural-behavioral responses and dynamically optimize teaching content, achieving <strong>neuro-cultural co-adaptation</strong>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The "Cultural Algorithm" hypothesis not only provides a social account of neuroplasticity but also challenges the paradigm of "biological determinism." Social norms are no longer merely external constraints—they are <strong>source code for endogenous neural programs</strong>. In the co-evolution of brain and culture, our brains are both products and executors of culture. Understanding this algorithm is key to human psychological adaptation and AI collaboration in a pluralistic world.</p>
