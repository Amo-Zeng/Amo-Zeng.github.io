            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of medical science and the profound changes in disease patterns, the traditional medical education model is facing unprecedented challenges. For a long time, medical education has focused on disease diagnosis and treatment, emphasizing the transmission of knowledge and in-depth research within a single discipline. However, this model shows significant limitations when dealing with complex health issues in modern society. This article will explore the transformation of medical education from "disease treatment" to "health promotion," the necessity of shifting from "single discipline" to "interdisciplinary collaboration," and the paradigm shift from "knowledge transmission" to "competence development." Furthermore, it will propose concrete pathways for constructing a new system for medical education in the future.</p>

            <h3>I. From "Disease Treatment" to "Health Promotion": The Shift in Philosophy</h3>
            <p>Currently, chronic non-communicable diseases have become the primary threat to human health. These diseases are closely related to lifestyle, environmental factors, and socio-psychological factors. The traditional treatment model focuses on the identification of symptoms and pathological changes, neglecting the dynamic relationship between disease and health. The World Health Organization's definition of health has gone beyond the scope of "not being sick," emphasizing that health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. The concept of health promotion has emerged, emphasizing collective efforts at individual, community, and societal levels to create a healthy social environment, enhance health literacy, and achieve universal health.</p>

            <h3>II. From "Single Discipline" to "Interdisciplinary Collaboration": The Imperative Choice for Addressing Complex Diseases</h3>
            <p>Traditional medical education is based on disciplinary divisions, where physicians often focus only on a specific field, leading to a narrow knowledge base and difficulty in addressing the complexities of modern medicine. Single-discipline thinking can easily fall into the trap of "seeing the trees but not the forest," neglecting the holistic needs of patients and making it difficult to achieve true personalized treatment. Additionally, excessive specialization and lack of cross-disciplinary integration limit the possibilities for medical innovation and hinder medical progress.</p>

            <h3>III. From "Knowledge Transmission" to "Competence Development": The Paradigm Shift in Physician Training</h3>
            <p>The traditional "knowledge transmission" model reduces medical education to a one-way transfer of knowledge, neglecting the development of students' competencies and individualized growth. Its primary limitations include focusing on textbooks while ignoring individual differences, being exam-oriented with insufficient practical training, and being teacher-centered with a lack of interactive learning. These drawbacks result in medical students' knowledge updates lagging behind medical advancements, mismatches between practical skills and clinical needs, and deficiencies in humanistic care and communication abilities.</p>

            <h3>IV. Pathways for Building a New Medical Education System in the Future</h3>
            <p>Integrating the philosophy of health promotion throughout the entire process of medical education, from basic medicine to clinical practice, from theoretical learning to skill training, and permeating the mindset and behavior of every medical student. Reshaping the curriculum to break down disciplinary barriers, adding interdisciplinary cross-disciplinary courses, and cultivating students' interdisciplinary thinking and knowledge base.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>From "disease treatment" to "health promotion," from "single discipline" to "interdisciplinary collaboration," and from "knowledge transmission" to "competence development," the paradigm shift in medical education is not only an inevitable choice in response to modern medical challenges but also a crucial pathway for advancing medical progress and the development of human health. Constructing a new medical education system in the future requires concerted efforts from governments, medical institutions, medical schools, healthcare professionals, and other stakeholders to break free from the limitations of traditional models, cultivate outstanding medical talents who are adaptable to future medical developments, and contribute to achieving the goal of universal health.</p>
