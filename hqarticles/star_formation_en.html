            <h2>The Formation of Stars: A Complex and Fascinating Process</h2>
            <p>The formation of stars is a complex and fascinating process involving the aggregation of matter in the universe, gravitational effects, nuclear reactions, and more. By exploring this process from the perspectives of timescale, multi-band observation, and environmental impact, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the different stages of star formation and the underlying physical mechanisms. This article will delve into the process of star formation and the scientific principles behind it from these three perspectives.</p>

            <h3>1. Star Formation from a Timescale Perspective</h3>
            <h4>1.1 Formation of Molecular Clouds</h4>
            <p>The raw material for star formation is molecular clouds, which are vast clouds of gas and dust primarily composed of hydrogen and small amounts of helium and other heavy elements. The formation of molecular clouds is a relatively slow process, typically taking millions of years. In the Milky Way, the formation of molecular clouds is influenced by various factors, including supernova explosions, stellar winds, magnetic fields, and the spiral arm structure of the galaxy. These factors can trigger the aggregation of gas and dust, forming regions of higher density that provide the necessary conditions for star formation.</p>
            <h4>1.2 Density Fluctuations and Gravitational Collapse</h4>
            <p>Density fluctuations within molecular clouds are a key trigger for star formation. When certain regions within a molecular cloud become more dense due to density fluctuations, the gravitational force in these regions increases, attracting surrounding matter. This process is known as gravitational collapse. As matter continues to accumulate, the density and temperature in these regions gradually increase, forming a protostellar disk. The protostellar disk is an early stage of star formation, with the highest density and gradually increasing temperature in its central region.</p>
            <h4>1.3 Formation of Protostars</h4>
            <p>As matter continues to accumulate, the temperature and pressure in the central region of the protostellar disk gradually increase, eventually reaching conditions sufficient to trigger nuclear fusion reactions. This stage is known as the protostar stage. During the protostar stage, the temperature in the central region typically reaches several million degrees, and the pressure is extremely high. When nuclear fusion begins, hydrogen nuclei fuse into helium under high temperature and pressure, releasing enormous amounts of energy. This marks the birth of a new star.</p>
            <h4>1.4 The Main Sequence Stage of Stars</h4>
            <p>Once nuclear fusion begins, the star enters the main sequence stage. During the main sequence stage, the star maintains its internal thermal equilibrium through nuclear fusion reactions, allowing it to emit light and heat steadily. The main sequence stage is the longest phase in a star's life cycle, lasting billions of years for stars like the Sun. During this period, the internal structure and external characteristics of the star remain relatively stable, although it still undergoes subtle changes.</p>
            <h4>1.5 Late Evolution of Stars</h4>
            <p>The late evolution of a star depends on its initial mass. For low-mass stars like the Sun, after the main sequence stage, the star expands into a red giant, eventually ejecting its outer layers to form a planetary nebula, with the core evolving into a white dwarf. For high-mass stars, after the main sequence stage, the star undergoes more complex evolutionary processes, potentially ending its life in a supernova explosion, with the core possibly evolving into a neutron star or black hole.</p>

            <h3>2. Star Formation from a Multi-Band Observation Perspective</h3>
            <h4>2.1 Observations of Molecular Clouds</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Radio Observations:</strong> Molecular clouds are primarily composed of hydrogen and small amounts of helium and other heavy elements. These gases emit radio waves at low temperatures. Through radio observations, scientists can detect molecular gases such as carbon monoxide (CO) and water (H2O) within molecular clouds. The distribution and motion of these molecular gases provide important information about the internal structure and dynamics of molecular clouds.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrared Observations:</strong> Dust in molecular clouds absorbs background starlight and re-emits it as infrared radiation. Through infrared observations, scientists can penetrate dust clouds and directly observe the early stages of star formation. Infrared observations can also reveal the temperature distribution and density structure within molecular clouds, helping scientists understand the physical conditions inside the clouds.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.2 Observations of Protostellar Disks</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infrared Observations:</strong> The protostellar disk is an early stage of star formation, with the highest density and gradually increasing temperature in its central region. Infrared observations can penetrate dust clouds and directly observe the internal structure of protostellar disks. Through infrared spectroscopy, scientists can study the chemical composition and physical conditions within protostellar disks, understanding the process of matter accumulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Submillimeter Observations:</strong> Dust and gas in protostellar disks emit submillimeter waves at low temperatures. Through submillimeter observations, scientists can detect the dust and gas in protostellar disks. These observations provide insights into the physical conditions and dynamics of the disks, including the distribution of matter and the processes of disk evolution.</li>
