            <h2>Dynamic Evolution and Cross-Domain Applications of Semantic Valence: Deep Integration of Language, AI, and Emotion Computing</h2>
            <p>Semantic valence, as a core concept in linguistics, not only reflects the positive or negative inclination of words in emotional dimensions but also profoundly embodies the close connection between language and human emotions and attitudes. With the cross-disciplinary integration and development of linguistics, artificial intelligence (AI), and emotion computing, the theory and practice of semantic valence have gradually expanded to broader fields, covering language evolution, AI bias optimization, and multimodal emotion transmission. This article will explore the cross-domain applications of semantic valence in language, artificial intelligence, and emotion computing from a dynamic evolutionary perspective, revealing its profound impact on technological progress and social development.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>I. Dynamic Evolution of Semantic Valence and Language Evolution</h3>
            <p>Language is one of the most important communication tools in human society, carrying both the function of information transmission and reflecting the changes in society, culture, and history. In the process of language evolution, semantic valence is not static but shows dynamic evolutionary characteristics driven by social context, cultural communication, and technological progress.</p>
            <h4>1.1 Interaction of Semantic Valence with Social Context</h4>
            <p>The dynamic evolution of semantic valence is rooted in the social and cultural nature of language. The semantic valence of words is often closely related to the values, aesthetic tendencies, and moral judgments of specific social groups. For example, the Chinese word "小姐" (Miss) was a respectful term for young women in ancient times, but with social changes, it has gradually taken on a derogatory connotation in some contexts, becoming an implicit label of discrimination for certain professional women. In recent years, with social progress, the semantic valence of the word "小姐" has gradually returned to neutrality, which is not only a change at the language level but also a reflection of social concepts and cultural cognition.</p>
            <h4>1.2 Cross-Cultural Communication and Dynamic Changes in Semantic Valence</h4>
            <p>Under the background of globalization, cross-cultural communication is another important driving force for the dynamic evolution of semantic valence. The borrowing of foreign words and the input of cultural concepts often lead to changes in the semantic valence of certain words in the local language. For instance, the English word "hacker" originally referred to a technical expert in the field of computers, but with the change in media reports and public perception, it has gradually evolved to mean a hacker who illegally intrudes into computer systems, with the semantic valence shifting from positive to negative. Similar examples are abundant in the Chinese internet context, such as the word "土豪" (nouveau riche), whose semantic valence has shown ambiguity and diversity in online culture, reflecting the profound impact of cross-cultural communication on language evolution.</p>
            <h4>1.3 New Word Generation and Innovation in Semantic Valence</h4>
            <p>The emergence of new words often accompanies the redefinition of semantic valence. For example, the word "网红" (internet celebrity) initially had a certain positive connotation, but with the complexity of the internet environment, its semantic valence has gradually taken on a derogatory color of superficiality and commercialization. This flexible semantic valence not only reflects the innovative ability of language but also demonstrates society's open attitude towards new things and concepts.</p>

            <h3>II. Bias and Optimization of Semantic Valence in AI Language Models</h3>
            <p>With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, language models (such as ChatGPT) have become indispensable information processing tools in modern society. However, the widespread application of language models has also raised concerns about the inherent biases in the models. These biases are mainly manifested as stereotypes about race, gender, and social class, and these biases often stem from the imbalance of semantic valence in training data.</p>
            <h4>2.1 Semantic Valence and Bias in AI</h4>
            <p>In AI language models, semantic valence is encoded as the co-occurrence frequency and statistical correlation between words. However, since the training data often comes from human society, it inevitably contains some language expressions with biases. For example, the model may tend to associate certain races with specific professions or personality traits, or solidify gender with traditional roles. This semantic valence bias not only affects the quality of the model's output but may also exacerbate social inequalities.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Optimization Strategies for Semantic Valence</h4>
            <p>To reduce bias in AI language models, we can start with the adjustment of semantic valence and adopt the following strategies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Filtering and Balancing</strong>: Filter the data before model training, removing expressions with obvious bias and adding diverse training data to ensure a balanced distribution of semantic valence across all groups.</li>
                <li><strong>Semantic Reconstruction</strong>: Adjust the correlation frequency between words through algorithms to break stereotypes. For example, reduce the strong correlation between gender and profession and increase cross-gender and cross-racial semantic combinations.</li>
                <li><strong>Context Sensitivity</strong>: Improve the model's understanding of context, allowing it to generate more neutral and inclusive text based on specific contexts.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.3 Combination of Semantic Valence and AI Ethics</h4>
            <p>The optimization of semantic valence is not only a technical issue but also an ethical one. By adjusting semantic valence, we can reduce the bias of the model and enhance its fairness and inclusiveness. This not only contributes to the development of AI ethics but also provides more neutral and diverse technical support for human-computer interaction and intelligent services.</p>

            <h3>III. Cross-Modal Correlation of Semantic Valence and Emotion Computing</h3>
            <p>In human daily communication, the transmission of emotions does not rely on a single modality but is achieved through the synergy of text, voice, and visual modalities. As a core concept in linguistics, semantic valence plays an important role in emotion computing.</p>
            <h4>3.1 Dynamic Performance of Cross-Modal Semantic Valence</h4>
            <p>In text, voice, and visual modalities, the expression of semantic valence varies. For example, the sentence "你真聪明" (You are so smart) may convey completely different emotional tendencies depending on the tone (such as appreciation or sarcasm) and facial expressions (such as a smile or a frown). This cross-modal difference in semantic valence brings new challenges and opportunities to emotion computing.</p>
            <h4>3.2 Realization of Multimodal Emotion Computing</h4>
            <p>By integrating the results of text sentiment analysis, voice emotion recognition, and visual emotion computing, a more comprehensive and accurate emotion recognition model can be constructed. This multimodal fusion not only improves the accuracy of emotion computing but also provides a deeper understanding of the dynamic changes in emotion transmission.</p>
            <h4>3.3 Semantic Valence and the Future of Emotional Intelligence</h4>
            <p>With the continuous accumulation of multimodal data and the progress of analysis technology, the cross-domain integration of semantic valence and emotion computing will provide new theoretical support and technological pathways for the development of emotional intelligence. In the future, emotion computing will play an increasingly important role in human-computer interaction, intelligent services, and emotional intelligence.</p>

            <h3>IV. Conclusion</h3>
            <p>As a core concept in linguistics, the application of semantic valence in language evolution, artificial intelligence, and emotion computing reveals the profound connection between language, technology, and society. Through the exploration of the dynamic evolution of semantic valence, AI bias optimization, and multimodal emotion computing, we can better understand how language reflects social changes, how technology drives ethical progress, and how emotions are effectively transmitted through multimodal expressions. In the future, with the continuous deepening of interdisciplinary research, the theory and practice of semantic valence will contribute to building a fairer, more diverse, and intelligent society.</p>
