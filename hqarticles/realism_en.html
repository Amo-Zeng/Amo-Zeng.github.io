            <h2>Realism's "Globalization": Writing the Common Destiny of Humanity in a Multicultural Context</h2>
            <p>Realism, as a literary genre, is often perceived as a specific product of a particular country or region. However, when we examine realism within the context of globalization, we find that it is not merely a localized literary phenomenon but a global literary trend. Under the backdrop of globalization, realist writers face common challenges and opportunities, collectively writing the common destiny of humanity through diverse cultural perspectives and artistic techniques.</p>

            <h3>Realism's "Globalization" is first reflected in its inclusive embrace of multiculturalism.</h3>
            <p>Whether it be Balzac in Europe or Marquez in Latin America, realist writers delve into the essence of reality within their own cultural contexts, portraying the social realities and cultural traits of different regions. This cultural diversity not only enriches the content of realist works but also infuses them with broader perspectives and richer modes of expression. For example, in "To Live," contemporary Chinese author Yu Hua depicts the hardships of an ordinary farmer's life, showcasing the social changes and the hardships of people's lives following the establishment of the People's Republic of China. This narrative of suffering is not unique to China but resonates deeply with other realist works from around the world.</p>

            <h3>Realism's "Globalization" also manifests in its exploration of common social issues.</h3>
            <p>Whether it be the alienation resulting from capitalism or the phenomenon of social inequality, these issues are profoundly reflected in realist works from various regions. For instance, John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath" portrays the difficult lives of farmers during the Great Depression in America, while Rabindranath Tagore's "Gora" reveals caste conflicts and religious tensions in Indian society. While these works emerge from different cultural backgrounds, they all address common social issues, reflecting shared human concerns in reality.</p>

            <h3>More importantly, realism's "globalization" is evident in its focus on the common destiny of humanity.</h3>
            <p>In the context of globalization, realist writers not only concern themselves with the social realities of their own regions but also with the common destiny of humanity. For example, Haruki Murakami's "Norwegian Wood" explores the loneliness and disorientation of modern people, while J.M. Coetzee's "Disgrace" reveals the social dilemmas of the post-colonial era. These works not only reflect the social realities of their respective regions but also the shared confusion and challenges under globalization.</p>
