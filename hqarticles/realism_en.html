            <h2>The Core of Realism and Cultural Influence</h2>
            <p>Realism, as an artistic expression, is fundamentally about the objective depiction of reality. However, this "objectivity" is inherently influenced by cultural backgrounds, personal experiences, and other factors. Realist works in different cultural contexts often present distinct visions of reality. This article will analyze realist works on the same subject across different cultural contexts to explore how cultural differences affect artists' representations of reality.</p>
