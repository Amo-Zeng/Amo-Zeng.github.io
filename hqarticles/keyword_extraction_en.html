            <h2>Multi-Domain Applications of Keyword Extraction Technology</h2>
            <p>With the deepening of globalization and the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, keyword extraction technology is playing an increasingly important role in cross-lingual sentiment analysis, content creation in generative AI, and content recommendation in short video platforms. This article will delve into the innovative applications and future development directions of keyword extraction technology from these three perspectives, revealing its importance and challenges in different fields.</p>

            <h3>I. Applications and Challenges in Cross-Lingual Sentiment Analysis</h3>
            <p>Cross-Lingual Sentiment Analysis (CLSA) is a hot research topic in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), aiming to identify and extract sentiment polarities (such as positive, negative, or neutral) from texts in different languages. Keyword extraction technology plays a crucial role in this process, as it can identify key sentiment words or phrases from multilingual texts, helping models capture sentiment information more accurately. However, keyword extraction in cross-lingual sentiment analysis faces multiple challenges, including language structure differences, translation accuracy, and cultural background differences.</p>

                <li><strong>Construction of Multilingual Sentiment Lexicons</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Support for Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Recognition of Cultural Differences in Sentiment Expression</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Collaborative Optimization in Generative AI</h3>
            <p>Generative AI (such as ChatGPT, GPT-4) possesses powerful capabilities in content creation and information generation, but its outputs often heavily depend on input keywords or prompt words. This phenomenon reveals a core issue: the creative capabilities of generative AI are largely constrained by its understanding and utilization of keywords. How to achieve collaborative optimization between keyword extraction and generative AI, ensuring both the accuracy and relevance of content while stimulating more innovative outputs, is a subject worthy of in-depth exploration.</p>

            <h3>III. Content Recommendation and User Interest Modeling in Short Video Platforms</h3>
            <p>With the rapid development of short video platforms, content recommendation systems have become one of their core competitive advantages. As an effective means of content understanding, keyword extraction technology is playing an increasingly important role in content recommendation and user interest modeling in short video platforms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multimodal Keyword Extraction</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Innovative Applications in User Interest Modeling</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Collaborative Innovation between Keyword Extraction and Recommendation Systems</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Keyword extraction technology has significant innovative application value in cross-lingual sentiment analysis, content creation in generative AI, and content recommendation in short video platforms. Through multimodal keyword extraction, platforms can comprehensively understand video content; through mining user behavior and implicit interest keywords, platforms can more accurately model user interests. In the future, with the continuous development of technology, keyword extraction will bring more possibilities to intelligent recommendation systems in short video platforms, driving further innovation and development in the industry.</p>
