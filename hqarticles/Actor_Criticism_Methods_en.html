            <h2>Crossing Boundaries: From Actor's Technical Performance to Identity Reconstruction of the Creator</h2>
            <p>In traditional performance criticism, "emotional resonance" has always been considered the core criterion for judging the success of an actor's performance. However, with the deepening development of performance studies, cultural studies, and "auteur theory," we have gradually come to realize that an actor's performance is far more than simple emotion transmission; it is a multidimensional artistic creation process. This article aims to break the single standard of "emotional resonance," re-examining the rich nuances of performing arts from three perspectives: the actor's technical performance, the leap from "self" to "other," and the reconstruction of the actor's identity as a creator.</p>

            <h3>Breaking the Single "Emotional Resonance" Standard: The Balance of Technique and Emotion</h3>
            <p>"Emotional resonance" is indeed an important aspect of performing arts, but considering it the sole criterion for evaluation can easily overlook the multiple possibilities in an actor's technical proficiency, artistic creativity, and interaction with the audience. The audience's experience of a performance is diverse, involving both emotional engagement and rational analysis. A successful performance often achieves balance between emotion and reason, touching the heart while inspiring thought.</p>
            <p>Rational analysis also plays a crucial role in performance criticism. The audience can analyze the actor's technical use, the logic of character building, and the rational development of the plot, thereby gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the performance's meaning. For example, how an actor conveys complex emotional information through voice, body, and expression on a limited stage, or how they build dramatic tension through interaction with fellow actors—these are all worthy of in-depth discussion.</p>

            <h3>From "Self" to "Other": The Actor's Soul Leap</h3>
            <p>Each performance on stage or screen is not merely a display of technical skills, but a deep exploration and expression of the character's soul. In this process, the actor not only demonstrates superb skills but also completes the leap from "self" to "other." This leap is not only about the depth of the performance but also involves the actor's personal growth, cultural understanding, and empathy for human emotions.</p>
            <p>The actor's performance process is essentially a contest between "self" and "other." The actor needs to maintain self-awareness while fully immersing in the character's world. This tension is not only a technical challenge but also a profound psychological test. Excessive retention of self-awareness can make the character appear mechanical, while completely losing oneself may cause the actor to become trapped in the role, potentially leading to psychological issues. Therefore, the art of acting largely depends on balancing these two states.</p>
            <p>The character's soul is not only present in the actor's imagination but is deeply rooted in the historical background, social environment, and cultural context of the character. Thus, the success of character creation largely depends on the actor's understanding and expression of these cultural factors. By playing characters from different cultural backgrounds, actors can broaden their horizons and enhance their understanding and empathy for the "other" world.</p>

            <h3>Beyond the "Performer" Identity: The Actor as a Creator</h3>
            <p>In traditional theater and film creation, actors are often seen as "performers," whose task seems to be simply transforming the script's words into vivid characters. However, with the development of "auteur theory" and "performance studies," we have gradually come to realize that actors are not just "performers"; they are also significant creators of the work. Through their own understanding, style, and artistic pursuit, actors engage in secondary creation of the script, collaborating with directors, screenwriters, and other creators to construct the overall work.</p>
            <p>The script is the foundation of a film or theatrical work, but it is not an unchanging blueprint. When actors receive a script, they do not simply "replicate" the words; instead, they interpret and perform the script based on their own understanding. This process of secondary creation includes deep excavation of the character's psychology and re-interpretation of lines, actions, and expressions. For example, Tim Robbins' deep understanding of the character in "The Shawshank Redemption" added more emotional layers to Andy Dufresne, allowing the audience to feel the character's inner world.</p>
            <p>An actor's performance style is their unique artistic signature formed through long-term practice. It not only influences character creation but is also closely related to the overall work. How an actor integrates their unique performance style into the work and collaborates with other creators to complete the work is an important dimension in discussing the actor as a creator. Daniel Day-Lewis is known for his细腻, profound, and tension-filled performance style. In "Lincoln," he enhanced the artistic value of the character by integrating his personal style with the role.</p>
            <p>An actor's performance is not just a display of technique but also a reflection of their artistic pursuit and creative philosophy. Through their performance, actors convey their thoughts and emotions, expressing their understanding and insights about the world. Meryl Streep's deep exploration of Margaret Thatcher's inner world in "The Iron Lady" showcased the character's complex and multifaceted emotions and thoughts, making her a true creator of the work.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The charm of performing arts lies not only in emotional resonance but also in the perfect fusion of technique and art, as well as the dynamic interaction between the audience and the actor. The actor's performance process is a soul leap from "self" to "other," as well as a secondary creation of the script and a contribution to the overall work. Through the combination of rational analysis and emotional resonance, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the rich nuances of performing arts, building a deeper and more diverse critical approach. In this process, actors are no longer merely "performers"; through their understanding, style, and artistic pursuit, they become significant creators of the work. This understanding beyond the "performer" identity provides us with a new perspective, allowing us to more deeply appreciate and understand the artistic value of film and theater works.</p>
