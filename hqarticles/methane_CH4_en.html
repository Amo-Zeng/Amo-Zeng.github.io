However, in recent years, with innovations in catalysts and reaction conditions, scientists have successfully developed various efficient methane conversion technologies, transforming it from a greenhouse gas into green energy.</p>
            <h4>1.1 Innovations in Catalysts and Reaction Conditions</h4>
            <p>Methane's chemical inertness makes it difficult to participate directly in complex chemical reactions under conventional conditions. While traditional high-temperature conversion methods are effective, they are energy-intensive and produce numerous by-products. Recent advancements in low-temperature catalytic technology have provided new possibilities for efficient methane conversion. For example, transition metal catalysts (such as ruthenium, rhodium, and platinum) have shown excellent performance in direct methane oxidation reactions, enabling methane activation and selective oxidation at lower temperatures. Additionally, the application of nanomaterials (such as metal oxides and carbon-based materials) has significantly improved reaction selectivity and efficiency. These technological breakthroughs not only reduce energy consumption but also decrease the generation of by-products, laying the foundation for efficient methane conversion.</p>
            <h4>1.2 Industrial Application Prospects of Methane Oxidation to Methanol</h4>
            <p>The technological breakthrough in methane oxidation to methanol provides a new pathway for green chemical production. Compared to the traditional syngas method, direct oxidation has significant advantages: reducing intermediate steps, lowering energy consumption, and carbon emissions. Although challenges such as reaction selectivity, catalyst stability, and lifespan remain in industrial applications, with ongoing technological advancements, methane oxidation to methanol is expected to be widely applied in regions rich in natural gas resources. This not only supports local economic development but also contributes to greenhouse gas reduction.</p>
            <h4>1.3 Potential of Methane Cracking for Hydrogen Production</h4>
            <p>Methane cracking for hydrogen production (CH₄ → C + 2H₂) is a potential carbon-free energy technology. While issues such as energy consumption under high-temperature conditions and the collection and utilization of solid carbon remain technical challenges, this technology has the potential to provide a clean energy source for large-scale hydrogen production. Particularly in regions rich in natural gas resources, methane cracking for hydrogen production has broad application prospects. With the increasing demand for hydrogen energy, this technology is expected to become an important component of future clean energy systems.</p>

            <h3>2. Microbial Metabolic Mechanisms of Methane: From Nature to Artificial Simulation</h3>
            <p>The generation and decomposition of methane in nature are primarily driven by microbial activities, a phenomenon known as the "methane cycle." By studying the metabolic mechanisms of methane-producing bacteria and methane-oxidizing bacteria, scientists have not only deepened their understanding of the natural carbon cycle but also provided scientific basis for artificial simulation of this process.</p>
            <h4>2.1 Metabolic Pathways of Methane-Producing Bacteria</h4>
            <p>Methane-producing bacteria are obligate anaerobic microorganisms that can reduce carbon dioxide (CO₂) and hydrogen (H₂) to methane. The carbon dioxide reduction pathway (CO₂ + 4H₂ → CH₄ + 2H₂O) and the methyl compound utilization pathway are the two main metabolic pathways for methane production. This process is widely present in nature and can be achieved through artificial anaerobic cultivation for efficient methane production. The potential for bioenergy development provides new ideas for future green energy supply.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Metabolic Pathways of Methane-Oxidizing Bacteria</h4>
            <p>Methane-oxidizing bacteria are aerobic microorganisms that can utilize methane as the sole carbon and energy source. Type I and Type II methane-oxidizing bacteria convert methane to methanol through methane monooxygenase (pMMO/sMMO), which is then transformed into carbon dioxide and other metabolic products. This process not only participates in methane decomposition in nature but can also achieve efficient methane oxidation through controlled cultivation, reducing atmospheric methane concentration. This biotechnology has important applications in methane treatment and greenhouse gas reduction.</p>
            <h4>2.3 Development of Artificial Methane Treatment Systems</h4>
            <p>Based on an understanding of microbial metabolic mechanisms, scientists have developed various artificial methane treatment systems, such as biofilters and bioreactors. These systems optimize reaction conditions and microbial cultivation to achieve targeted methane conversion, widely applied in landfills, natural gas leak treatment, and other fields. Additionally, the application of genetic engineering technology has further improved the metabolic efficiency of methane-oxidizing bacteria, providing new possibilities for the commercial application of methane treatment. These artificial systems not only enhance methane treatment efficiency but also offer new solutions for environmental protection and energy utilization.</p>
