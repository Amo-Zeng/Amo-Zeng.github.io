            <h3>Fusion of PaaS and Edge Computing: Reshaping Data Processing and Service Delivery</h3>
            <p>The combination of PaaS and edge computing is increasingly becoming a key technology for driving innovation. This fusion is not just a technical overlay but a profound reshaping of data processing and service delivery methods. Edge computing pushes computing resources to the edge of the network, near the data sources, combining with PaaS's flexibility and scalability to enable real-time data processing, reduce latency, and enhance service response speeds.</p>

            <h3>Role of PaaS in Sustainable Technological Development</h3>
            <p>PaaS technology plays a significant role in promoting environmental and social sustainability. By providing a centralized platform, PaaS allows developers and businesses to build, test, and deploy applications in the cloud, greatly optimizing the use of computing resources. Compared to traditional on-premises data centers, the PaaS model achieves higher resource utilization and reduces energy waste due to idle computing resources.</p>

            <h3>Transformation of Industrial Chains and Business Models</h3>
            <p>The integration of PaaS and edge computing not only changes the way data is processed and services are delivered but also drives the transformation of industrial chains and business models. Businesses can deploy and manage distributed applications more flexibly, and developers can rapidly build and iterate edge applications using the PaaS platform, thereby accelerating innovation and market responsiveness.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
            <p>Although the fusion of PaaS and edge computing shows great potential, it also faces some challenges. Security is an issue that cannot be ignored in the development of PaaS. With more sensitive data being stored in the cloud, strengthening security measures is crucial for ensuring the sustainable development of PaaS. Solutions include enhancing security protection at the edge nodes, such as using hardware security modules and software encryption technologies.</p>
