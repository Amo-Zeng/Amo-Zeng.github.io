            <h3>"Dragon Style" Action Design and Its Symbolic Meaning</h3>
            <p>Jackie Chan's signature action design, widely known as "Dragon Style", is not just visually stunning and entertaining; it also carries rich symbolic meanings, symbolizing a spirit of challenging authority, defying fate, and pursuing personal limits.</p>
            <p>Firstly, Jackie's humorous fighting scenes are not just for entertaining the audience; they also subvert the serious and solemn atmosphere in traditional martial arts films. In these humorous fighting scenes, Jackie combines comical and funny elements, making the fight scenes not just a contest of strength but a competition of wisdom and ingenuity. This design challenges the single worship of strength and authority in traditional martial arts films, indicating that even in the face of powerful opponents, wisdom and humor can be the key to victory. This challenge to authority is not only reflected in the movie plot but also deeply resonates with the audience's psychological level, inspiring reflection and questioning of existing orders and authorities.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Jackie's practical stunts represent a defiance of fate. In the films, Jackie often plays a small character facing powerful enemies or irresistible fate. He never gives up but overcomes difficulties through continuous self-surpassing and brave struggles. This action design not only showcases Jackie's personal physical limits but also symbolizes an indomitable spirit. Regardless of how fate is arranged, individuals have the ability to change their circumstances through effort and persistence. This theme of defying fate motivates countless viewers to maintain optimism and positivity when facing setbacks in real life.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Jackie's "Dragon Style" action language also embodies a spirit of pursuing personal limits. In the films, Jackie often completes various high-difficulty actions in seemingly impossible ways, not only testing his physical fitness but also challenging his willpower and psychological limits. This constant pursuit of limits symbolizes human's desire for self-transcendence. Jackie's action design tells us that only by continuously challenging ourselves can we reach higher realms and achieve greater accomplishments. This spirit is not only applicable to characters in the films but also has enlightening significance for everyone in real life.</p>
