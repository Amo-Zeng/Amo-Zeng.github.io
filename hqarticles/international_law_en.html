                <li><strong>Paragraph Organization</strong>: Each paragraph should revolve around a central idea, avoiding information clutter. Use transitional sentences to help readers understand connections between paragraphs.</li>
                <li><strong>Argumentation Process</strong>: After proposing a viewpoint, provide sufficient evidence and analysis to support your claim.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Consistent Style</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Language Style</strong>: Choose a language style suitable for your target audience and maintain consistency throughout. Whether it's formal, academic, or more conversational, it should run through the entire article.</li>

            <h3>Example Revision</h3>
            <p>Suppose you wrote an article on "The Impact of Remote Work," here is an example of how to apply the above suggestions for revision:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Original Paragraph:</p>
                <cite>Remote work is becoming increasingly popular. Many people enjoy working from home because it offers flexibility. However, this also brings some challenges, such as communication and collaboration issues.</cite>
                <p>Revised:</p>
                <cite>With technological advancements, remote work has become a significant trend in the modern workplace (Introduction, clear theme). Research indicates that over 70% of employees report increased productivity and satisfaction from working from home (Academic depth, provide research support). Nevertheless, remote work faces numerous challenges, such as delayed communication and barriers to team collaboration, which require managers to adopt new strategies to overcome (Clear logic, comparative argumentation). For instance, implementing regular virtual meetings and using collaboration tools can significantly improve interaction within remote teams (Practical breadth, propose solutions).</cite>
