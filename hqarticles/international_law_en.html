            <h3>Challenges and Opportunities Presented by Emerging Technologies to the Framework of International Law</h3>
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Ethical and Legal Dilemmas of Artificial Intelligence</strong>  
                    The widespread application of artificial intelligence (AI) in military, medical, and financial fields has raised issues concerning the development and use of autonomous weapons systems. According to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), the international community expresses concerns about the ethical issues of "killer robots," yet the existing international legal framework has not yet clearly regulated these technologies. For example, the operational reliance of U.S. drone warfare on complex algorithms raises questions about whether its autonomy complies with the "principle of distinction" in the Geneva Conventions.</li>
                <li><strong>Blockchain's Impact on Sovereignty and Privacy</strong>  
                    The decentralized nature of blockchain technology offers new paradigms for data management and transactions but also poses challenges to national sovereignty and data privacy. The cross-border circulation of cryptocurrencies bypasses traditional financial regulatory systems, making money laundering and terrorist financing more complex. Frequent cross-border disputes reveal the inadequacy of traditional international legal frameworks in addressing these issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Media and Platform Liability</strong>  
                    Social media has transformed information dissemination but also brought about problems such as misinformation, hate speech, and privacy breaches. According to the International Human Rights Law, citizens have the right to freedom of speech, but the responsibility of social media platforms as information disseminators remains ambiguous. For instance, issues regarding platform liability in data privacy, intellectual property, and misinformation dissemination have led to cross-border legal disputes.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Opportunities:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Blockchain-Based Voting System for International Courts</strong>  
                    The high transparency and immutability of blockchain technology provide new tools for the implementation and supervision of international law. For example, a blockchain-based voting system for international courts could be established, ensuring the fairness and transparency of the voting process through smart contracts, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of judgments.</li>
                <li><strong>Utilizing AI to Improve the Efficiency of International Law Enforcement</strong>  
                    The data analysis and predictive capabilities of artificial intelligence can support the enforcement of international law. For instance, AI algorithms can analyze global trade data to more quickly identify violations of international trade rules, improving judicial efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Media and Global Citizen Participation</strong>  
                    Social media offers new channels for global citizens to participate in the formulation and supervision of international law. Citizens can stay informed about international law developments in real-time, express opinions, and provide suggestions, enhancing the democratic and transparent nature of international law.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Integration of Environmental Justice and International Law</h3>
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Disagreements on Climate Change Responsibility Sharing</strong>  
                    Climate change is one of the greatest challenges to environmental justice. The differences between developed and developing countries in responsibility sharing have led to imbalances in the responsibility allocation mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, making it difficult to achieve environmental justice in global climate governance.</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of Biodiversity and Unequal Benefit Distribution</strong>  
                    Global biodiversity is under severe threat, with the excessive exploitation of biological resources by developed countries and the lack of technology in developing countries resulting in unequal benefit distribution. Existing international legal frameworks such as the Convention on Biological Diversity still have unfair benefit distribution mechanisms, hindering the realization of environmental justice.</li>
                <li><strong>Difficulties in Cross-Border Pollution Governance</strong>  
                    Issues such as air and water pollution involving multiple national interests pose challenges to existing international laws like the Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution Convention. The insufficient cooperation mechanisms and accountability systems make it difficult to effectively address complex environmental problems.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Opportunities:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Establishing Fair Environmental Damage Compensation Mechanisms</strong>  
                    Exploring fairer environmental damage compensation mechanisms, clarifying the responsibility of developed countries for environmental damage in developing countries, expanding the scope of compensation, and raising compensation standards will help promote the realization of environmental justice.</li>
                <li><strong>Formulating Environmental Protection Clauses for Vulnerable Groups</strong>  
                    Vulnerable groups such as women, children, and indigenous peoples are more susceptible to environmental pollution and ecological damage. By formulating environmental protection clauses for these groups, their environmental rights can be clarified, and financial and technical support can be provided to safeguard their environmental rights.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Responsibilities of Transnational Corporations and Human Rights Protection in the Context of Globalization</h3>
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Labor Rights Issues</strong>  
                    Transnational corporations often disregard basic labor rights, such as child labor, poor working conditions, and low wages, in their operations in developing countries. The complex supply chains of these companies allow them to evade legal constraints, leading to difficulties in labor rights protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Protection and Resource Exploitation</strong>  
                    The production and operation activities of transnational corporations may cause environmental pollution and destruction in host countries, such as excessive exploitation of natural resources, emissions of harmful substances, and destruction of biodiversity, contravening the principles of sustainable development.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Participation and Social Conflicts</strong>  
                    Transnational corporations often lack effective communication with local communities when entering new markets or developing new projects, leading to the neglect of community members' interests and demands and even triggering social conflicts.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Opportunities:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Building Responsible Corporate Operation Models</strong>  
                    Transnational corporations should actively fulfill corporate social responsibility, establishing partnerships with host country governments and local communities to jointly develop sustainable development strategies. For example, implementing transparent supply chain management systems, providing fair labor treatment, and participating in community development projects.</li>
                <li><strong>Improving the International Legal System and Strengthening Supervision and Sanction Mechanisms</strong>  
                    Existing international laws such as the United Nations Global Compact and the International Labour Organization Convention provide a basic framework for human rights protection by transnational corporations, but their binding力和 enforcement力 is limited. The international legal system needs further improvement, with the establishment of more independent supervisory institutions, clear legal responsibilities, and increased sanctions against non-compliant companies.</li>
            </ol>
