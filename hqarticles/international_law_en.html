            <h2>Beyond Traditional Frameworks: Building an Adaptive International Legal System to Address Global Challenges</h2>
            <p>In the context of accelerating globalization and profound changes in the international landscape, the traditional international legal system faces unprecedented challenges. For a long time, the principles of state-centrism and state sovereignty have dominated international relations and the theory and practice of international law, but this state-centered single perspective has become increasingly inadequate in dealing with the complex and changing realities of the international community. At the same time, the formal justice and static rule characteristics of international law have exposed significant limitations when addressing global issues. To meet the challenges of the new era, international law must transcend traditional frameworks, focusing on the rise of multiple actors, the realization of substantive justice, and the enhancement of dynamic adaptability, thereby constructing a more inclusive, just, and flexible international legal system.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>1. The Rise of Multiple Actors: Transcending State-Centrism</h3>
            <p>The traditional Westphalian system emphasizes that state sovereignty is inviolable, and states are the sole subjects of international relations and international law. However, with the advancement of globalization, an increasing number of non-state actors, such as international organizations, multinational corporations, non-governmental organizations, and individuals, are playing an increasingly important role on the international stage, challenging the hegemony of state-centrism.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>International Organizations:</strong> Entities like the United Nations, World Trade Organization, and International Monetary Fund play crucial roles in maintaining international peace and security and promoting global economic cooperation. Their actions often transcend the interests of individual states, reflecting the诉求 of global governance.</li>
                <li><strong>Multinational Corporations:</strong> As the main drivers of economic globalization, multinational corporations wield substantial economic power and global networks, influencing areas such as politics and culture, and becoming formidable international actors.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Governmental Organizations:</strong> Organizations like Greenpeace and Amnesty International are active in environmental protection and human rights, using public opinion and lobbying to constrain state behavior and promote global attention to vulnerable groups and global issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Individuals:</strong> The development of internet technology has made information dissemination more accessible, enabling ordinary individuals to participate in international discussions through social media, express opinions, and influence international public opinion and policy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The rise of multiple actors does not aim to replace states but to form a new interactive model with states. To adapt to this reality, international law needs to transcend state-centrism, expand the scope of international law subjects, recognize and regulate the legal status of multiple actors, and promote international law towards a more pluralistic and inclusive direction.</p>

            <h3>2. Transcending Formal Justice: Focusing on Substantive Justice and Social Values</h3>
            <p>For a long time, the formal justice of international law emphasizes the authority of legal provisions and the legitimacy of procedures, based on state sovereignty, and regulates state behavior through treaties and customary law. However, this formal justice faces many practical challenges, especially in addressing global challenges and achieving substantive justice.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limited Effectiveness:</strong> International law lacks a mandatory enforcement mechanism, making it difficult to effectively sanction and punish states that violate international law, leading to insufficient constraints of international law.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Representation:</strong> The international legal system has long been dominated by developed countries, often ignoring the interests and诉求 of developing countries, leading to doubts about the representativeness and fairness of international law.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Scope of Application:</strong> International law primarily regulates relations between states, with limited constraints on non-state actors, making it difficult to effectively address global issues such as climate change, terrorism, and transnational crime.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To address the limitations of formal justice, the international community is calling for greater emphasis on substantive justice, focusing on the actual effects and social values of international law. To achieve this, international law needs to expand its subject scope, strengthen enforcement, develop new principles and rules, and enhance the connection with domestic law, thereby constructing a more socially focused and practically effective international legal system.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>3. Transcending Static Rules: Promoting Dynamic Development and Adaptability of International Law</h3>
            <p>The traditional international legal system is based on fundamental principles such as state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and non-interference in internal affairs, primarily regulating state behavior through treaties, customary law, and general legal principles. However, this system shows significant limitations when addressing global challenges: lagging behind, fragmentation, and insufficient enforcement.</p>
            <p>In terms of technological progress, the rapid development of emerging technologies such as the internet, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology presents unprecedented challenges to international law. In terms of environmental changes, issues such as climate change, oceanic and polar governance, and biodiversity protection demand higher adaptability from international law. In terms of social change, issues such as gender equality, refugee and migration problems, and digital era human rights require expansion and innovation in international law.</p>
            <p>To promote the dynamic development of international law, the international community can adopt the following approaches:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Strengthen the "Soft Law" Mechanism of International Law:</strong> By formulating soft law documents, the international community can quickly reach consensus in emerging fields, laying the foundation for the establishment of hard law.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhance the Functionality of International Judicial Institutions:</strong> International courts such as the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court can expand their jurisdiction, improve enforcement, and enhance the binding force of international law.</li>
                <li><strong>Promote Multilateralism in International Cooperation:</strong> The resolution of global issues requires multilateral cooperation. The international community should strengthen the role of international organizations such as the United Nations and promote coordinated actions among countries in areas such as environment, technology, and human rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhance Public Participation in International Law:</strong> The formulation of international law should not be limited to negotiations between states but should also吸纳 the opinions of non-governmental organizations, academia, and the public to enhance transparency and public participation.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h3>4. Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In the context of deepening globalization, rapid technological progress, and increasingly prominent environmental and social issues, international law must transcend traditional frameworks and build a more inclusive, just, and flexible system. By focusing on the rise of multiple actors, achieving substantive justice, and promoting dynamic adaptability, international law can better address the complex challenges of the new era, maintain international order, promote global cooperation, and achieve the common well-being of humanity.</p>
