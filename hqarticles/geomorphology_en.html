            <h2>I. Landforms as “Writers” of Earth's Memory</h2>
            <p>Earth, this blue planet, carries billions of years of history and transformation. Over this vast expanse of time, landforms have uniquely recorded every pulse and breath of the planet. They are not only masterpieces of natural forces but also “writers” of Earth's memory, narrating stories sealed by time through layers and silent tales.</p>
            <h3>1. The Layering of Time: The “Tree Rings” of Landforms</h3>
            <p>The formation of landforms is a long and complex process. Every mountain, river, and desert is the result of the joint action of time and natural forces. Just as tree rings record their growth, each layer of rock and every groove in landforms are the “tree rings” of Earth's history.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The “Pages” of Sedimentary Rocks</strong>: Sedimentary rocks are one of the most common rock types in landforms, formed by the long-term compaction and cementation of layered sediments. Each layer of sedimentary rock is like a page, recording the environment, climate, and biological activities of that time.</li>
                <li><strong>The “Furnace” of Igneous Rocks</strong>: Igneous rocks are formed by the cooling and solidification of magma deep within the Earth’s crust, recording the planet’s internal violent activities.</li>
                <li><strong>The “Transformation” of Metamorphic Rocks</strong>: Metamorphic rocks form under high temperature and pressure, where existing rocks undergo physical and chemical changes. They record major geological events like crustal movements and plate collisions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Silent Narratives: The “Language” of Landforms</h3>
            <p>Landforms are not only recorders of time but also silent narrators. Through their unique terrain and features, they convey rich information about Earth’s history.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The “Rise” of Mountains</strong>: The formation of mountains is often closely related to geological activities such as plate collisions and crustal uplift.</li>
                <li><strong>The “Sculpting” of Rivers</strong>: Rivers are “sculptors” of landforms, shaping canyons, plains, and deltas through erosion, transportation, and deposition.</li>
                <li><strong>The “Traces” of Glaciers</strong>: Glaciers are “recorders” of Earth’s climate changes, leaving behind features like moraines and glacial lakes through erosion and deposition.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. The Enlightenment of Landforms: Human-Earth Symbiosis</h3>
            <p>Landforms are not only witnesses to Earth’s history but also provide insights into the symbiotic relationship between humans and the planet.
