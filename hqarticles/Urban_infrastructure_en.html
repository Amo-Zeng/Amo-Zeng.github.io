            <h2>Data-Driven Infrastructure Management: Building a Smart and Efficient Future</h2>
            <p>As urbanization accelerates and digital technologies rapidly evolve, infrastructure management is becoming increasingly complex. Traditional approaches struggle to meet the demands of efficiency, sustainability, and adaptability. As a result, data-driven intelligent lifecycle management platforms for infrastructure are emerging as the mainstream solution for next-generation infrastructure management.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Challenges in Infrastructure Lifecycle Management</h3>
            <p>Infrastructure spans multiple domains such as transportation, energy, water resources, and construction. Its management often involves multiple stakeholders and complex data systems. The full lifecycle includes planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning, each stage of which is plagued by issues like data silos, low efficiency, and resource waste.</p>
