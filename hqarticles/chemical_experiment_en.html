            <h2>The Artistic Aspect of Chemical Experiments: Application and Creation of Aesthetics</h2>
            <p>Chemical experiments are not just tools for scientists but also provide new forms of artistic expression. **Flame tests** exhibit a colorful visual effect through the combustion of different metal salts in flames, attracting artists like Alexander McQueen, who incorporated them into fashion shows. **The Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction**'s periodic color changes have been used by artist Sachiko Kodama to create interactive art. Furthermore, the light effects from burning magnesium ribbon are used as material in light and shadow art.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Ethical and Social Impacts of Chemical Experiments</h2>
            <p>The application of chemical experiments has brought forth numerous ethical issues and social impacts. For example, ethical controversies surrounding gene editing involve "designer babies" and enhancement of human traits, compelling us to reconsider the limits and responsibilities of science. Additionally, issues like plastic pollution highlight the role of chemical experiments in environmental protection, leading to the formulation of strict regulations like REACH.</p>
            <p>Public attitudes towards chemical experiments have also shifted, from initial trust to current skepticism and concern over safety. Incidents like the melamine contamination in Chinese milk powder have further deepened public concerns over food safety and chemical usage, underscoring the responsibilities of scientists and policymakers in maintaining public trust and safety.</p>
