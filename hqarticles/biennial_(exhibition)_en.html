            <h2>Cultural and Political Games in the Context of Globalization</h2>
            <p>In the wave of globalization, biennials have become an important arena for the competition of urban cultural soft power. Internationally renowned biennials such as the Venice Biennale and the São Paulo Biennale have successfully shaped the global cultural image of their host cities through their high exposure and international participation. However, this globalization process has also brought deep cultural and political games. The dominant position of Western curators and capital institutions often leads to a power imbalance between "locality" and "globalization," making the definition and presentation of "marginality" highly subjective. For example, local issues in the São Paulo Biennale are often simplified by international audiences as "Third World narratives," highlighting the issue of power imbalance in cultural representation.</p>

            <h2>Technological Innovation and the Expansion of Artistic Expression</h2>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technology has brought new possibilities and challenges to biennials. Innovative forms such as AI art, cyber bodies, and metaverse exhibitions are redefining the boundaries of artistic creation. The generative art of the Ai-Da robot challenges the concept of "creator," and VR exhibition halls reconstruct the viewing experience, reflecting the profound impact of technology on the art ecosystem. However, these technological applications also bring new ethical dilemmas: disputes over the copyright of AI art, privacy risks in digital biennials, and the "green paradox" in ecological art practices all urgently require the establishment of corresponding norms and frameworks.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Intervention in Social Issues and Reflection on Curatorial Ethics</h2>
            <p>Contemporary biennials are increasingly becoming an important platform for discussing social issues. From indigenous rights to gender equality, from ecological crises to technological ethics, biennials attempt to provide a space for these significant issues. However, this intervention often faces the risk of formalization and symbolization. How to truly grant creative autonomy to marginalized groups, rather than staying at symbolic inclusion, is a question that biennials need to deeply consider. The Taipei Biennial's attempt to promote environmental awareness through interactive installations, while demonstrating the potential of art to intervene in social issues, also needs to be wary of "disaster aesthetics" obscuring actual solutions.</p>

            <h2>The Future Path of Biennials: Critical Innovation and Institutional Change</h2>
            <p>Facing these challenges, the future development of biennials needs to find a balance between "critical inclusion" and "actionable innovation." Specifically, exploration can be conducted from the following three dimensions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Construction of Decentralized Curatorial Models:</strong> Promote direct participation of local artists and communities in planning, reducing the "cultural intermediary" role of Western curators. The African Biennial's practice of using tribal democratic deliberation to decide exhibition topics provides a useful reference for this direction.</li>
                <li><strong>Establishment of Ethical Frameworks for Technological Applications:</strong> Develop creation norms for AI art (such as transparent algorithm source declarations) and privacy conventions for digital exhibitions to ensure that technological applications do not deviate from the original intention of humanistic care.</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainable Practices of Virtual and Physical Integration:</strong> By combining the sensory impact of physical exhibitions with the global accessibility of digital biennials, while implementing low-carbon exhibition setups and renewable energy power supply, achieve a balance between art display and ecological responsibility.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>As a cultural mirror of the globalization era and a testing ground for social fragmentation, biennials have demonstrated the potential of art to intervene in significant issues, while also exposing the friction between technological utopian idealism and real power structures. Future biennials need to maintain criticality while promoting substantive change through institutional innovation, truly becoming a "laboratory for world transformation." This requires not only the renewal of curatorial concepts but also the collaborative efforts of the entire art ecosystem to build a more inclusive, innovative, and responsible biennial paradigm.</p>
