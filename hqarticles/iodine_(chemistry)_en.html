            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Iodine, a seemingly insignificant trace element, plays a pivotal role in human health, ecological balance, and historical progress. From its metabolic regulation in the human body, to its circulation in marine ecosystems, and its transformation in global public health, the journey of iodine is not only a reflection of scientific discoveries but also a vivid example of how humanity improves the quality of life through scientific means.</p>

            <h2>Iodine and Health: The Art of Balance</h2>
            <p>The role of iodine in the human body is not to be underestimated. As a crucial component for the synthesis of thyroid hormones, iodine directly impacts metabolic rate, growth, and nervous system function. The thyroid gland, a small organ in the neck, absorbs iodine to produce and release thyroid hormones, thereby regulating the body's metabolic rate. Both deficiency and excess of thyroid hormones can lead to various health issues, ranging from fatigue and weight changes to abnormal heart rates and anxiety. Therefore, adequate intake of iodine is essential for maintaining normal thyroid function.</p>
            <p>However, in modern society, the issue of iodine intake has become increasingly complex. The widespread use of iodized salt has significantly reduced the incidence of iodine-deficiency diseases such as goiter, but it has also introduced the risk of iodine overdose. Studies show that prolonged excessive iodine intake may lead to hyperthyroidism and even goiter. This phenomenon is particularly common in coastal areas where food naturally contains high levels of iodine. On the other hand, the dangers of iodine deficiency are equally significant. It can lead to goiter, reduced metabolic rate, and may affect children's intellectual and growth development.</p>

            <h2>Iodine and Environment: The Life Cycle in the Ocean</h2>
            <p>The importance of iodine is not limited to the fields of medicine and nutrition. As one of the key elements in marine ecosystems, iodine plays a central role in maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance. Iodine in the ocean primarily originates from volcanic eruptions, hydrothermal activities on the seafloor, and riverine input. This inorganic iodine combines with organic molecules through chemical reactions in the ocean, which are then absorbed and utilized by primary producers such as plankton and seaweed.</p>
            <p>The cycling of iodine in the ocean mainly relies on biogeochemical processes. Phytoplankton and seaweed absorb iodide dissolved in water through photosynthesis and convert it into organic iodine compounds such as methyl iodide and iodine acetate. These organic iodine compounds not only help plankton resist UV radiation but also pass through the food chain to higher-level marine organisms. As zooplankton, fish, and marine mammals consume these organisms, the organic iodine accumulates in their bodies and is further transmitted to higher predators.</p>
            <p>However, the disruption of iodine cycling due to marine pollution is increasingly severe, leading to increased uncertainty in human iodine intake. Plastic pollution, heavy metal pollution, and the misuse of chemicals are disrupting the iodine balance in the ocean. Contaminants adsorbed on microplastics inhibit phytoplankton's absorption of iodine, while heavy metals compete with iodine for receptor sites in the thyroid, interfering with the synthesis of thyroid hormones. These changes not only affect the health of marine ecosystems but also impact human health through the biological amplification effect of the food chain.</p>

            <h2>The History of Iodine: From Medical Miracle to Daily Necessity</h2>
            <p>The history of iodine dates back to the early 19th century. In 1811, the French chemist Bernard Courtois first discovered the element iodine. Initially, iodine did not attract much attention until 1820 when French pharmacists Courtois and Desormes used it to treat goiter, marking its debut in the medical field. In 1839, French military surgeon Pierre-Fran√ßois Gerbillon first used tincture of iodine as a wound disinfectant, a discovery that was considered a major breakthrough in medical history.</p>
            <p>By the late 19th century, scientists began to understand the relationship between iodine and thyroid function. In 1896, Swiss chemists Emil von Mueller and Oskar Meier demonstrated through experiments that the active component of thyroid hormones was iodine compounds. This discovery marked a revolutionary advancement in the field of endocrinology. In the early 20th century, scientists realized that iodine deficiency was a widespread problem globally. In the 1920s, American physician David Marine conducted a series of studies confirming the direct link between iodine deficiency and goiter.</p>
            <p>In the mid-20th century, as awareness of iodine deficiency disorders deepened, scientists and public health experts began exploring ways to supplement iodine through daily diets. In 1924, the United States became the first country to mandate iodine addition to salt, significantly reducing the incidence of goiter. Subsequently, this practice was adopted by many countries worldwide. The promotion of iodized salt had a profound impact on global public health, particularly in developing countries where iodine deficiency was a major cause of intellectual and growth retardation and thyroid diseases. Through iodine addition to salt, iodine deficiency in these countries has been significantly improved.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Protecting the Iodine Cycle, Safeguarding Human Health</h2>
            <p>Iodine is not only a crucial element for human health but also a key component in marine ecosystems. The iodine cycle in the ocean, facilitated by plankton and seaweed, enters the food chain and eventually provides essential nutrients for humans. However, marine pollution and human activities are disrupting this natural cycle, altering the distribution and bioavailability of iodine, thereby affecting human iodine intake.</p>
            <p>To protect human iodine health, we need to examine the relationship between iodine and the environment from a broader perspective, reduce damage to marine ecosystems, and restore and protect the iodine cycle in the ocean. By reducing plastic pollution, controlling heavy metal emissions, and rationally developing marine resources, we can ensure that iodine, an essential element for life, plays its proper role in the global biogeochemical cycle, providing continuous protection for human health. Iodine's journey from a medical miracle in the early 19th century to a daily necessity in the 20th century profoundly influenced the health of billions of people worldwide. Through scientific discoveries and policy-making, iodine evolved from an enigmatic chemical element to a key component of global public health, demonstrating how science can enhance human well-being by revolutionizing everyday life.</p>
