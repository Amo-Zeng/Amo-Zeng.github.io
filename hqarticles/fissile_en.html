            <h2>Historical Evolution of Nuclear Fission</h2>
            <p>The principle and proof of nuclear fission began in 1938, proposed by German physicists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. They confirmed that uranium nuclei, upon absorbing neutrons, could split into two lighter nuclei, releasing enormous energy, laying the groundwork for nuclear energy applications.</p>

            <h2>Future Prospects of Nuclear Fission</h2>
            <p>The future of nuclear energy must focus on enhancing safety and resolving issues related to nuclear waste production and disposal. With the global rise in demand for sustainable energy, the prospect of nuclear energy lies in its integration with renewable sources. New reactor technologies, such as Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and molten salt reactors, could become part of the future energy landscape.</p>

            <h2>Nuclear Fission and Environmental Protection: Balancing Energy Demand and Ecological Responsibility</h2>
            <p>To balance energy demand with ecological responsibility, we need to implement a series of comprehensive measures, such as increasing investment in nuclear fission technology development, enhancing its safety and efficiency, reducing nuclear waste production, and advancing waste reprocessing and long-term storage technologies. Additionally, developing a diversified energy supply system, including renewable and clean energy, reduces reliance on a single energy form.</p>
