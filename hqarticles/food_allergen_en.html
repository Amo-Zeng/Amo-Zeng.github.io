            <h2>The Interplay of Environment, Genetics, and Allergy Management: A Multi-Dimensional Exploration</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>With global environmental changes and advancements in science and technology, allergies have become an increasingly prominent health challenge in modern society. This article will comprehensively explore how environmental factors, genomics, and consumer behavior affect allergy management.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Environmental Factors and Allergen Changes</h3>
            <h4>Climate Change and Allergens</h4>
            <p>Climate change directly affects allergens in plants, such as making allergenic proteins more stable in high temperatures, and increased COâ‚‚ levels promoting increased allergen expression.</p>
            <h4>Pollution and Allergens</h4>
            <p>Increased air and soil pollution raises the risk of allergic reactions, with pollutants possibly combining with pollen to form more allergenic complexes.</p>
            <h4>Impact of Urbanization on Allergies</h4>
            <p>Urbanization brings changes in diet and lifestyle, potentially increasing exposure to new allergens and weakening the immune system.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Genomics and Personalized Allergy Management</h3>
            <h4>Prediction and Prevention</h4>
            <p>Through genomic technologies, doctors can provide personalized prevention strategies for high-risk individuals, reducing the likelihood of allergies.</p>
            <h4>Potential of Gene Editing</h4>
            <p>Gene editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 offer new avenues for allergy treatment but face ethical and safety challenges.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Allergen Labeling and Consumer Behavior</h3>
            <h4>Optimization of Label Design</h4>
            <p>Optimizing allergen labeling systems can enhance the comprehensibility and accessibility of information.</p>
            <h4>Consumer Psychology and Behavior</h4>
            <p>Factors such as consumer perception of allergen risk, cognitive load, and emotional responses play significant roles in decision-making processes.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Comprehensive Management Strategies and Future Outlook</h3>
            <p>Allergy management needs to be approached from three aspects: environment, genetics, and consumer behavior:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Management:</strong> Reducing allergen production and spread through improved agricultural practices, reduced pollution, and optimized urban planning.</li>
                <li><strong>Application of Genomics:</strong> Offering personalized allergy prevention and treatment plans, exploring the potential of gene editing.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumer Education and Behavior Guidance:</strong> Optimizing allergen label design, fostering consumer awareness and correct consumption habits regarding allergens.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Future research should promote interdisciplinary collaboration to develop more scientific and comprehensive allergy management strategies.</p>
