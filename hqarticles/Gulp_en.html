            <h2>Gulp, Micro Frontends, and Low-Code/No-Code: The Future of Build Tools</h2>
            <p>As frontend technology continues to evolve, the ecosystem of build tools is also undergoing profound changes. Gulp, as a representative of traditional build tools, once played a significant role in the field of frontend automation. However, with the rise of emerging tools like Vite and Snowpack, has Gulp's "stream pipeline" concept become outdated? In the context of Micro Frontend architectures and Low-Code/No-Code platforms, does Gulp still hold value? This article will delve into the competition for ecological niches of Gulp in the emerging technological environment, analyze its unique applications in Micro Frontend architectures and Low-Code/No-Code platforms, and look ahead to its future development directions.</p>

            <h3>The "Stream Pipeline" Concept of Gulp: Is It Obsolete?</h3>
            <p>The core concept of Gulp is to connect various build tasks through a "stream pipeline" to achieve efficient automation. Although this design has demonstrated strong flexibility and scalability in handling complex frontend projects, with the continuous development of frontend engineering, emerging build tools like Vite and Snowpack, which leverage "native modularity" and "on-demand compilation," have quickly become developers' new favorites.</p>
            <h4>Advantages of Gulp:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flexibility and Extensibility</strong>: Gulp has a rich plugin ecosystem, allowing developers to freely combine plugins based on project needs to meet various complex build tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Easy to Learn</strong>: Gulp's API design is simple and understandable, enabling developers to quickly implement automated build processes with minimal configuration.</li>
                <li><strong>Mature Ecosystem</strong>: Gulp has been around for many years, with a large number of mature and stable plugins and an active community.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages of Gulp:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Performance Bottlenecks</strong>: When handling large projects or complex build tasks, Gulp's "stream pipeline" mechanism may encounter performance bottlenecks, resulting in slower build speeds compared to emerging tools.</li>
                <li><strong>Limitations of Legacy Architecture</strong>: Gulp's core architecture is based on Node.js's Stream module, which struggles to meet modern frontend development demands such as ES Modules support and on-demand compilation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The Rise of Emerging Tools: Vite and Snowpack</h4>
            <p>Tools like Vite and Snowpack leverage modern browsers' native support for ES Modules to implement features such as "on-demand compilation" and "instant development servers," significantly enhancing development experience and build performance. However, these tools' ecosystems are not yet fully mature, with some plugins still needing improvements in stability and functionality.</p>

            <h3>Gulp and Micro Frontend Architectures: The Key to Efficient Resource Integration and Scheduling</h3>
            <p>In Micro Frontend architectures, frontend applications are broken down into multiple independent sub-applications, each of which can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently. However, this architectural pattern also presents new challenges in resource integration and scheduling. Gulp, with its "stream pipeline" mechanism and powerful plugin ecosystem, has become a key tool for efficient resource integration and scheduling in Micro Frontend architectures.</p>
            <h4>Challenges of Resource Integration in Micro Frontend Architectures:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Dependency Management</strong>: Multiple sub-applications may rely on different third-party libraries, making it a challenge to avoid duplicate loading and version conflicts.</li>
                <li><strong>On-Demand Loading of Resources</strong>: How to achieve on-demand loading of resources to improve application performance and user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Sub-Application Resource Sharing</strong>: Different sub-applications need to share common resources such as styles and component libraries.</li>
                <li><strong>Complexity of Build Processes</strong>: The build process of Micro Frontend architectures is typically more complex than that of a single application.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Advantages of Gulp in Micro Frontend Architectures:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flexible Resource Integration Mechanism</strong>: Through Gulp's "stream pipeline," developers can string together resources from different sub-applications to achieve flexible resource integration. For example, merging CSS files from multiple sub-applications into a single global style file.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient Resource Scheduling Capability</strong>: Gulp's stream mechanism allows developers to group, sort, and schedule resources, ensuring the correct loading order.</li>
                <li><strong>Robust Plugin Ecosystem</strong>: Gulp has a rich plugin library that can meet various build needs in Micro Frontend architectures.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Future Development Directions:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Integrating Emerging Technologies</strong>: Gulp can integrate technologies such as ES Modules and Web Assembly to enhance performance and flexibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimizing the Plugin Ecosystem</strong>: Develop new plugins to support modern JavaScript syntax and popular frameworks.</li>
                <li><strong>Introducing Intelligent Scheduling</strong>: Incorporate intelligent features that automatically schedule resource loading based on user behavior.</li>
            </ul>
