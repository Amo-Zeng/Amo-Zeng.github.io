            <h2>Cross-Cultural Psychology: Cultural Transmission in the Digital Age, Cognitive Development in Multilingual Environments, and Identity Reconstruction in the Context of De-globalization</h2>
            <p>The wave of globalization once tightly connected the world, but as de-globalization trends rise, the reconstruction of cultural identity, cultural transmission in the digital age, and cognitive development in multilingual environments have become new focuses of cross-cultural psychology research. This article will explore the challenges and opportunities of cross-cultural psychology in the new era from these three cutting-edge perspectives and propose future research directions.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>1. Cultural Identity Reconstruction in the Context of De-globalization</h3>
            <p>Globalization provided people with a broad platform for cultural exchange, but it also led to concerns about cultural homogenization. Now, the trend of de-globalization has spurred a revival of local cultures, prompting people to re-examine and redefine their cultural identity. In this context, cross-cultural psychology faces new challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Cultural Revival and Personal Identity: </strong>The revival of local culture is not simply a cultural retrogression but a response to the cultural erosion of the globalization era. Individuals may face confusion and conflicts in cultural identity during the process of re-evaluating their own culture.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Cross-Cultural Exchange and Shifts in Thought Patterns: </strong>The trend of de-globalization leads to a reduction in cross-cultural exchange, which may weaken people's cultural inclusiveness and openness.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploration of Cultural Hybrid's Sense of Belonging: </strong>Globalization-era "cultural hybrids" have diverse cultural backgrounds, but in the context of de-globalization, they may face more complex identity dilemmas.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Cultural Transmission and Psychological Impact in the Digital Age</h3>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technology has reshaped the way cultural transmission occurs and has had a profound impact on people's psychology. Social media, online games, and short video platforms have become important channels for cultural transmission, and cross-cultural psychology needs to focus on the following issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Social Media and Cultural Stereotypes: </strong>Social media platforms are filled with various cultural symbols and labels, easily reinforcing cultural stereotypes and deepening cultural divides.</li>
                <li><strong>Online Subcultures and Mainstream Cultural Deconstruction: </strong>Online subcultures, with their unique discourse systems and expression methods, challenge and deconstruct mainstream cultures, providing individuals with space for self-expression and seeking identity.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic Recommendations and Cultural Choices: </strong>Algorithmic recommendation systems, based on users' browsing history and preferences, push personalized content, affecting people's cultural choices and thought patterns.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>3. Cognitive Development and Mental Health in Multilingual Environments</h3>
            <p>Multilingual environments have a profound impact on individuals' cognitive development, emotional expression, and mental health. The progress made by cross-cultural psychology in this field provides new insights for future research:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multilingual Skills and Creative Thinking: </strong>Research shows that multilingual skills can promote creative thinking and problem-solving abilities, as different language systems provide different cognitive tools and perspectives.</li>
                <li><strong>Language Systems and Emotional Expression: </strong>Different language systems have differences in emotional vocabulary and expression methods, which may affect individuals' emotional expression and emotional regulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Language Switching and Cognitive Load: </strong>During language switching, individuals need to inhibit one language system and activate another, which may increase cognitive load and affect mental health.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Practical Applications and Future Outlook</h3>
            <p>In future research, cross-cultural psychology needs to pay more attention to the dynamic interaction between culture and psychology, exploring theoretical innovations and practical applications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bilingual Education and Cross-Cultural Communication: </strong>Through bilingual education, children's cognitive development and emotional expression can be promoted, enhancing their cross-cultural communication skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Language Therapy and Psychological Support: </strong>In the field of language therapy, the application of multilingual environments is increasingly widespread. Comprehensive language therapy programs can help individuals better manage cognitive and emotional challenges in multilingual environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Research and Interventions in Digital Cultural Transmission: </strong>Understanding the mechanisms of cultural transmission in digital scenarios such as online games and short video platforms and their impact on individuals' psychology can help develop effective intervention measures to promote cross-cultural communication and understanding.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Cross-cultural psychology faces new challenges and opportunities in the context of "de-globalization," the digital age, and multilingual environments. Future research needs to pay more attention to the dynamic interaction between culture and psychology, exploring theoretical innovations and practical applications, contributing to the construction of a more inclusive and diverse cultural world.</p>
