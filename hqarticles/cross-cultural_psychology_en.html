Hello! When you say "Shu Jia," are you referring to Group A in a math competition, or does it mean something else? If it's convenient, could you please clarify what you need help with? For example, is it a math competition problem, study materials, or an explanation of a certain math concept? That way, I can assist you better!  

(Note: "数甲" is transliterated as "Shu Jia" here since it lacks a direct English equivalent. If it refers to a specific term like "Mathematics Advanced Level" or similar, you may adjust the translation accordingly based on context.)
