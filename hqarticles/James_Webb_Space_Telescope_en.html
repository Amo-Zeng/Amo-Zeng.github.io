            <h2>The Intersection of Science and Art</h2>
            <p>The infrared technology of JWST allows it to glimpse the early history of the universe, observe the formation of distant galaxies, and witness the birth of star and planetary systems. These discoveries have not only stirred the scientific community but also provided artists with an inexhaustible source of inspiration.</p>

            <h3>A Model of Interdisciplinary Collaboration</h3>
            <p>The success of JWST is first and foremost due to its interdisciplinary collaboration model. Astronomers require the help of physicists to understand the physical processes in the universe, engineers are responsible for designing and ensuring the stability and functionality of the telescope, while computer scientists develop advanced image processing software to analyze and interpret the vast amounts of data collected by the telescope.</p>

            <h3>Promoting the Development of New Technologies</h3>
            <p>The interdisciplinary collaboration of the JWST project has also promoted the development of several new technologies. For example, to manufacture ultra-precise instruments that can withstand the extreme temperature variations of space, engineers have developed new materials and manufacturing techniques. These technologies are not only significant in the space sector but also provide new possibilities for the manufacture of precision instruments on Earth.</p>

            <h3>A Vision for Future Cosmic Exploration</h3>
            <p>From the perspective of JWST, we can foresee a series of exciting scientific discoveries. JWST will delve into the early history of the universe, observing the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang, and is expected to capture the birth and evolution of early galaxies, whose light has traveled for billions of years to reach our telescope.</p>
