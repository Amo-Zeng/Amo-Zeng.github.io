            <h3>Basic Principles of Biosensors</h3>
            <p>Biosensors work by combining biological recognition elements (such as enzymes, antibodies, DNA, etc.) with physical or chemical sensors to detect specific biomolecules or biological activities, converting this information into measurable signals. Their high selectivity and sensitivity make biosensors applicable in a wide range of extreme and conventional environments.</p>

            <h3>Innovative Applications in Extreme Environments</h3>
            <p><strong>Deep Sea and Mars Life Detection</strong>: In the extreme high-pressure and low-temperature environments of the deep sea, biosensors use pressure-resistant materials and cold-resistant biomolecules to help scientists detect microbial activity and chemical composition, suggesting the possibility of life. In space exploration, NASA's probes use radiation-resistant materials and genetic engineering to protect biomolecules, overcoming the challenges of space to search for signs of life on Mars.</p>
            <p><strong>Volcanic Activity Monitoring</strong>: Biosensors deployed near volcano vents can monitor real-time changes in chemical composition, providing early warnings of eruptions. These sensors need to withstand high temperatures and resist acids and bases to adapt to the extreme conditions.</p>

            <h3>A New Era in Personal Health Monitoring</h3>
            <p>With the widespread adoption of IoT and AI, the integration of biosensors with wearable devices and smart home systems has ushered in a new era of personal health monitoring:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Glucose, Heart Rate, and Sleep Monitoring</strong>: Through continuous glucose monitoring systems, heart rate sensors, and sleep analysis sensors, users can obtain 24-hour health data, adjust lifestyles promptly, and prevent diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized Health Management</strong>: Smart home systems combined with environmental data and biological signals provide personalized health recommendations and early disease warnings, helping residents manage their health better.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Environmental Pollution Monitoring and Ecosystem Protection</h3>
            <p>Biosensors have shown unique advantages in environmental protection:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water Quality Monitoring</strong>: By using fish behavior or genetically engineered bacteria, biosensors can quickly detect pollutants in water, safeguarding water resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Air Quality Monitoring</strong>: Plants and microorganisms serve as biosensors, monitoring harmful substances in the air, providing real-time feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Health Monitoring</strong>: Changes in soil microorganisms and plant root systems provide early warnings for soil pollution, supporting sustainable agriculture.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Future Prospects and Technological Challenges</h3>
            <p>The future development of biosensor technology will increasingly rely on breakthroughs in nanotechnology and non-invasive detection methods to enhance sensitivity and user experience. However, challenges include data privacy protection, sensor accuracy, reliability, and user acceptance. As these issues are addressed, biosensors will not only be tools for scientific research but also become guardians of health in daily life and pioneers in environmental protection.</p>
