            <h2>Mathematical Foundations of DSP: From Fourier Transform to Wavelet Transform</h2>
            <h3>Fourier Transform: The Core Tool for Frequency Domain Analysis</h3>
            <p>The Fourier Transform is one of the most fundamental mathematical tools in DSP, converting signals from the time domain to the frequency domain, thereby revealing the frequency components of the signal. Whether for continuous or discrete signals, the Fourier Transform effectively analyzes the spectral characteristics of signals.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Continuous Fourier Transform</strong>: For a continuous-time signal \(x(t)\), the continuous Fourier Transform is defined as:
                    \[
                    X(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-j 2\pi f t} dt
                    \]
                    where \(X(f)\) represents the spectrum of the signal at frequency \(f\).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)</strong>: For a discrete signal \(x[n]\), the DFT is defined as:
                    \[
                    X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-j \frac{2\pi}{N} kn}
                    \]
                    DFT is widely used in digital signal processing for tasks such as spectral analysis, filtering, and signal compression.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications of Fourier Transform</h3>
            <p>The Fourier Transform has a wide range of applications in DSP, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spectral Analysis</strong>: By using the Fourier Transform, the frequency components of a signal can be analyzed, identifying the main frequency components.</li>
                <li><strong>Filtering</strong>: Filtering operations are implemented through simple multiplication in the frequency domain, such as low-pass filters removing high-frequency noise.</li>
                <li><strong>Signal Compression</strong>: Fourier Transform is used in image and audio compression to identify the main frequency components and achieve data compression.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Z-Transform: A Tool for Discrete System Analysis</h3>
            <p>The Z-Transform is another key tool for analyzing discrete-time systems, playing a significant role in system stability analysis and filter design.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition</strong>: For a discrete-time signal \(x[n]\), the Z-Transform is defined as:
                    \[
                    X(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] z^{-n}
                    \]
                    where \(z\) is a complex variable.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Applications</strong>: The Z-Transform is used to analyze the transfer function of a system, design digital filters, and determine system stability through pole locations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Wavelet Transform: A Tool for Non-Stationary Signal Analysis</h3>
            <p>While the Fourier Transform is powerful in spectral analysis, it has limited capabilities for non-stationary signals. The Wavelet Transform, using localized functions, provides information in both the time and frequency domains simultaneously.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)</strong>: Defined as:
                    \[
                    W(a, b) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) \psi^*_{a,b}(t) dt
                    \]
                    where \(\psi_{a,b}(t)\) is the wavelet function, and \(a\) and \(b\) represent the scaling and translation factors, respectively.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Applications</strong>: The Wavelet Transform is widely used in audio processing, image compression, and biomedical signal processing, especially for analyzing non-stationary signals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>AI-Driven DSP: Deep Learning Reshaping the Future of Signal Processing</h2>
            <h3>Integration of AI and DSP</h3>
            <p>Traditional DSP relies on hand-designed algorithms and mathematical tools like the Fourier Transform and Wavelet Transform, which perform well in specific scenarios but struggle with complex, high-dimensional, and nonlinear signals. The rise of AI, particularly deep learning, has brought revolutionary progress to DSP. Deep learning, by automatically extracting features from data, can handle complex signal processing tasks, significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of signal processing.</p>
            <h3>Speech Recognition: AI Empowering Voice Processing</h3>
            <p>Speech recognition is a key application area of DSP. Traditional speech recognition systems rely on hand-designed feature extraction methods and acoustic modeling based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM), which perform poorly in noisy environments.</p>
            <p>The introduction of deep learning has completely transformed the landscape of speech recognition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and attention-based models (such as Transformers) can automatically extract high-level features from raw audio data, significantly improving the robustness and accuracy of speech recognition. For example, Google's WaveNet model, using generative deep neural networks, directly generates speech waveforms, greatly enhancing the naturalness and realism of speech synthesis.</p>
            <h3>Image Processing: AI Redefining Image Processing Boundaries</h3>
            <p>Image processing is another core application area of DSP, including tasks such as image denoising, super-resolution, and image segmentation. Traditional image processing methods rely on hand-designed algorithms, such as wavelet transform denoising techniques or edge detection algorithms, which are limited in complex image data.</p>
            <p>The involvement of AI has brought revolutionary progress to image processing. Deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated strong capabilities in image processing tasks. For instance, in image denoising tasks, deep learning models can learn complex noise patterns from large-scale training data, generating clearer and more realistic images. In image super-resolution tasks, methods based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), such as ESRGAN, can produce high-resolution images with rich details.</p>
            <h3>Medical Imaging: AI Assisting Disease Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>The field of medical imaging is one of the most promising applications of AI-driven DSP. Traditional medical imaging relies on the experience and subjective judgment of doctors, which can be easily influenced by human factors. The introduction of AI, especially deep learning algorithms, can automatically extract key features from large amounts of medical imaging data, helping doctors detect and diagnose diseases more accurately.</p>
            <p>For example, in cancer detection, AI technology has demonstrated significant potential. Deep learning-based systems for analyzing mammograms can detect signs of breast cancer at an early stage, outperforming human experts. Similar technologies are also applied to the early screening of other cancers, such as lung and skin cancer.</p>
            <h3>Future Prospects: Combining Self-Supervised Learning with Edge Computing</h3>
            <p>Although AI-driven DSP has made significant progress in multiple fields, several challenges remain. Firstly, the training of deep learning models typically relies on large amounts of labeled data, which is expensive to obtain in some domains (such as medical imaging). Secondly, the interpretability of deep learning models is still an urgent problem to be solved.</p>
            <p>Future research directions may include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Self-Supervised Learning</strong>: Reducing reliance on labeled data through self-supervised learning methods, enhancing model generalization capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Federated Learning</strong>: Enabling collaborative model training across institutions while protecting data privacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Explainable AI</strong>: Developing more transparent and interpretable deep learning models, increasing trust in critical areas like healthcare and finance.</li>
                <li><strong>Edge Computing</strong>: Applying AI-driven DSP technology to edge devices, enabling real-time signal processing and intelligent decision-making.</li>

            <h2>DSP and Communication Technology: From Nyquist to 5G Evolution</h2>
            <h3>Historical Overview: The Foundations of Nyquist and Shannon</h3>
            <p>The theoretical foundations of digital signal processing can be traced back to the early 20th century. The Nyquist theorem states that to accurately reconstruct a band-limited signal, the sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest frequency of the signal. This theory provides theoretical support for sampling and reconstruction in digital communication systems.</p>
            <p>Subsequently, Claude Shannon proposed the Shannon theorem in 1948, stating that in a channel with noise, the upper limit of information transmission rate is determined by the channel bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio. Shannon's theorem provided important guidance for the development of modern communication technology.</p>
            <h3>Applications of DSP in Communication Systems</h3>
            <h4>2G/3G/4G: Gradual Evolution of DSP Technology</h4>
            <p>In the 2G, 3G, and 4G communication standards, DSP technology has driven the rapid development of mobile communication through techniques such as modulation and demodulation, channel coding, and multiple access. For example, 4G technology employs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and high-order modulation (such as 256QAM), significantly improving spectral efficiency and data transmission rates.</p>
            <h4>5G: Breakthroughs in DSP Technology</h4>
            <p>The advent of 5G marks another major leap in communication systems. DSP plays a more extensive and in-depth role in 5G, primarily in the following areas:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Massive MIMO</strong>: Through efficient matrix operations and signal processing algorithms, DSP enables real-time control of a large number of antennas, improving communication quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Beamforming</strong>: By adjusting the phase to concentrate signal energy in a specific direction, it enhances signal strength and communication quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Millimeter Wave Communication</strong>: Overcomes the challenges of millimeter wave communication through efficient channel estimation and adaptive modulation techniques.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Future Prospects: DSP Integration with 6G and Satellite Communication</h3>
            <p>With the continuous development of communication technology, emerging technologies such as 6G and satellite communication will become important directions for future communication. DSP will continue to play a key role in these fields, especially in high-frequency communication and intelligent network management.</p>
