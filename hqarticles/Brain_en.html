                <p>Humanity's exploration of the "self" has never ceased. From the inscription "Know Thyself" at the Temple of Delphi in ancient Greece to the deep deconstruction by modern neuroscience, we have gradually realized that the so-called "self" is not a fixed and unchanging entity, but a dynamic process emerging from the coupling of the brain, body, and environment.</p>
                <p>This cognitive model can be understood as a "triple-mirror" structure: the intrinsic mapping at the neural level, the embodied cognition mediated by technology and media, and the collective consciousness constructed by socio-culture. Each mirror is not a passive replication of reality, but an active, constructive cognitive operation. Within this framework, the "brain's internal ecosystem" and the "hybrid mind" become key concepts for understanding the openness and evolutionary nature of cognition.</p>
                <p>This article aims to systematically analyze these three cognitive mirrors by integrating the latest advances in neuroscience, cognitive science, and the philosophy of technology, thereby proposing how to rebuild the balance between humanities and science through cognitive humility and interdisciplinary dialogue in an era of technological acceleration.</p>

                <h3>I. The First Mirror: Neural Ecology and the Internal Construction of Cognition</h3>
                <p>The human brain is a highly complex network system. Its cognitive functions are not completed by an isolated brain region independently but are the result of emergence within a distributed network. This process is similar to the interaction of various organisms and environmental factors in an ecosystem, hence it can be termed the "brain's internal ecosystem."</p>
                <p>For example, memory is not a static archive but a process of reconstruction upon each retrieval (Schacter & Addis, 2007). In patients with Alzheimer's disease, this dynamic reconstruction ability significantly deteriorates. Recent research has found that the early pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease not only involve β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and Tau protein hyperphosphorylation but are also closely related to neuronal metabolic disorders, glial cell activation, and changes in the brain's immune microenvironment (De Strooper & Karran, 2021).</p>
                <p>Notably, a 2022 study using high-resolution functional MRI showed that even in high-risk populations, individuals with higher cognitive reserve could partially compensate for hippocampal damage by mobilizing the prefrontal-parietal control network, thereby delaying cognitive decline (Xie et al., 2022). This finding not only highlights the role of neuroplasticity in maintaining cognitive function but also reveals the significance of cognitive redundancy and compensatory mechanisms within the brain's internal ecosystem.</p>
                <p>Similarly, human perception and decision-making are filled with constructiveness and incompleteness. "Choice blindness" experiments show that subjects not only often fail to notice their decisions being manipulated but even automatically construct rationalizations for choices they never made (Johansson et al., 2005). Such phenomena reveal the fragile nature of the so-called "rational self"—consciousness is merely the surface phenomenon of cognitive processes, beneath which lies a vast amount of unconscious information processing and logical completion.</p>
                <p>From this first mirror, the essence of cognition is generative, not reflective; it is a process of continual self-updating through neural dynamics.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>II. The Second Mirror: Technological Mediation and Cognitive Extension</h3>
                <p>If cognition is already constructive and ecological within the cranium, this characteristic is further amplified and externalized in the cultural and technological environment. According to the extended mind thesis, cognitive processes are not confined within the skull but can cross boundaries, relying on external tools and socio-technical systems to achieve functional extension (Clark & Chalmers, 1998). From writing and printing to digital interfaces, each media revolution has redefined the boundaries of human cognition.</p>
                <p>The modern technological environment particularly exhibits strong cognitive mediation characteristics. For instance, search engines have become external memory systems, social platforms construct our social identities, and recommendation algorithms无形中 narrow or broaden our information horizons. This cognitive outsourcing is both liberating and carries potential risks. On one hand, it allows individuals to break through the limitations of biological cognition and form richer mind maps; but on the other hand, over-reliance on external cognitive agents may also lead to the degradation of internalized cognitive abilities (such as attention, critical thinking, memory encoding). Carr (2020) points out that with frequent multitasking and interface switching, users' abilities for deep reading and sustained thinking are facing significant challenges.</p>
                <p>Among these, the most thought-provoking are the radical attempts to fully migrate cognitive processes outward—"digital immortality" projects. For example, brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has recently made substantial breakthroughs in communication and control for paralyzed patients. In 2023, a Stanford University team, using intracranial EEG signal decoding and recurrent neural network models, enabled a paralyzed patient to type with their mind at a speed of 90 characters per minute (Willett et al., 2023).</p>
                <p>However, such technologies also raise deep controversies regarding consciousness integrity, privacy, and identity issues. Can we truly "upload" or "outsource" consciousness? Or are such attempts merely creating another cognitive prosthesis, unable to touch the essence of first-person experience? While the technological mirror amplifies cognitive abilities, it may also distort the continuity of self-cognition. We must cautiously address the potential for "self-alienation" in cognitive extension.</p>

                <h3>III. The Third Mirror: Socio-Culture and the Construction of Collective Cognition</h3>
                <p>Cognition is not only mediated by technology but is also deeply embedded in social and cultural structures. Language, symbols, institutions, and cultural norms together constitute a vast web of meaning. Each individual is shaped within this network while simultaneously participating in its reproduction. For example, collective memory is not the sum of individual memories but a shared reality constructed through cultural apparatuses like narratives, rituals, and public symbols (Halbwachs, 1992).</p>
                <p>Social cognitive psychology further points out that group beliefs and behavior patterns can form path dependence through mechanisms like conformity effects and information cascades, thereby suppressing individual rationality in certain situations (Mercier & Sperber, 2017).</p>
                <p>In today's world of increasingly prevalent algorithmic governance, platforms redefine social trust and value through datafication and scoring mechanisms (e.g., credit scores, social influence metrics). This improves efficiency but may also lead to bias固化 and systemic exclusion. Virtual communities (e.g., the metaverse, Discord groups) experimentally demonstrate the possibility of new forms of collective consciousness formation—they are both reflections of culture and creators of new cultural realities.</p>
                <p>In this third mirror, cognition is no longer an individual matter but a composite product of group interaction and cultural media. We need to develop corresponding ethical reflection and institutional constraints alongside technological tools to guide collective cognition towards a more inclusive and critical direction.</p>

                <h3>Synthetic Reflection: Towards Cognitive Openness Between the Three Mirrors</h3>
                <p>The above three mirrors are not isolated from each other but are embedded mutually and act together on the overall evolution of the cognitive structure. The dynamic construction of neurocognition provides the biological basis for technological extension; technological systems expand the possibilities of cognition but also bring about asymmetry in cognitive distribution; and socio-culture赋予 meaning and direction to cognitive processes, while also being reversely shaped by the combined action of individuals and technology.</p>
                <p>Understanding the multi-mirror nature of cognition requires us to abandon any single reductionist perspective and accept a systemic understanding that is cross-level and cross-disciplinary.</p>
                <p>In this context, the "brain's internal ecosystem" emphasizes the internal diversity and plasticity of cognition, while the "hybrid mind" highlights the deep integration of humans, machines, and the social environment in the cognitive process. These two concepts jointly point to an open, non-localized concept of cognition. It requires us to see both the physiological constraints of cognition and its dimensions of environmental coupling and cultural history; we must both develop technological capabilities to enhance cognition and cultivate the corresponding cognitive critical power and cultural awareness.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion: Cognitive Humility and Philosophical Scrutiny in the Technological Age</h3>
                <p>Mapped by the three mirrors, the essence of human cognition appears as a dynamic structure full of uncertainty and possibility. Faced with such a complex cognitive landscape, we can neither blindly推崇 technological solutions nor retreat to a conservative stance of biological essentialism. What we need is an open attitude based on "epistemic humility"—that is, acknowledging the limitations and situatedness of our own cognition, and being willing to continuously revise and expand the boundaries of the self through dialogue with others and with technology.</p>
                <p>Here, introducing technology philosopher Donna Haraway's "A Cyborg Manifesto" (1991) can provide us with a transdisciplinary intellectual resource. She advocates breaking down the traditional binary oppositions of nature/culture, human/machine, physical/symbolic, recognizing that we are already "composites" embedded in technological and social relationships. This highly resonates with the concept of the "hybrid mind," emphasizing the hybridity and co-evolution potential inherent in cognition and existence itself.</p>
                <p>From the perspective of complexity theory, the cognitive system is a nested, multi-agent adaptive system whose behavior cannot be fully predicted by laws from a single level (Mitchell, 2009). Therefore, in policy design, technological development, and individual cognitive strategies, we should place greater emphasis on adaptive governance, reflective practice, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Only in this way can we, in an era of technological acceleration and cognitive transformation, truly uphold the integration of humanistic spirit and scientific rationality, and move towards a cognitive future that is more open, inclusive, and wise.</p>
