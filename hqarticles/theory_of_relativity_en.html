            <h2>The Birth and Challenge of Relativity</h2>
            <p>In 1905, at the age of 26, Einstein proposed the theory of special relativity, marking a major revolution in physics. The core of special relativity is based on two fundamental assumptions: the constancy of the speed of light and the principle of relativity.</p>

            <h3>Time Dilation and Length Contraction</h3>
            <p>One of the most revolutionary predictions of special relativity is time dilation. According to Einstein's theory, when an object moves at a speed close to the speed of light, time within it slows down.</p>

            <h3>Resolving the Twin Paradox</h3>
            <p>The twin paradox is one of the most famous thought experiments in relativity. Suppose there are two twins, one of whom travels on a high-speed spaceship through interstellar space, while the other remains on Earth.</p>

            <h2>Breakthroughs in General Relativity</h2>
            <p>The success of special relativity did not stop Einstein. He realized that special relativity only applies to inertial frames, while the gravitational problems in the real world involve non-inertial frames.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Gravitational Waves and Black Holes</h3>
            <p>General relativity not only explained the slight deviations in planetary orbits but also predicted the existence of gravitational waves and the formation of black holes.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Experimental Verification of Relativity</h2>
            <p>The proposal of relativity sparked widespread interest in the scientific community, but its true value lies in experimental verification. Time dilation and length contraction in special relativity have been verified in high-energy particle accelerators.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Relativity and Modern Technology</h2>
            <p>Relativity has not only garnered significant attention in the physics community but has also had a profound impact on modern technology. One of the most notable applications is the GPS navigation system.</p>
