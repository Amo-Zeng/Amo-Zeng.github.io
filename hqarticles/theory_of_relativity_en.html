            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the early 20th century, physics underwent two revolutionary changes: Einstein's theory of relativity and the birth of quantum mechanics. Relativity revealed the relativity of space and time and the nature of gravity, while quantum mechanics described the peculiar behavior of microscopic particles. Despite their great success in their respective fields, there are profound contradictions between the two, especially in the unification of gravity and quantum effects. In recent years, scientists have begun to explore the integration of relativity and quantum entanglement, attempting to find common ground between these two seemingly incompatible theories. At the same time, the impact of relativity has extended to the fields of biology and sociology, providing new ways to understand life and time.</p>

            <h2>1. Integration of Relativity and Quantum Entanglement</h2>
            <p>Relativity, particularly general relativity, describes physical phenomena on a macroscopic scale, such as gravity and the curvature of spacetime. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, applies to the microscopic scale, describing the behavior of atoms and subatomic particles. There are significant differences in their mathematical forms and physical concepts. For example, relativity emphasizes causality and locality, while quantum mechanics allows for non-local quantum entanglement, where the states of two entangled particles are instantaneously correlated regardless of the distance between them.</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is one of the most mysterious phenomena in quantum mechanics. When two particles are entangled, their states are inseparable, even if they are separated by vast distances. This non-locality conflicts with the principle of locality in relativity, but recent research suggests that quantum entanglement may be related to the structure of spacetime itself. In 2013, physicist Mark Van Raamsdonk proposed that quantum entanglement might be the foundation of spacetime structure. He suggested that the geometry of spacetime can be described by quantum entangled states, with the strength of the entanglement determining the connectivity of spacetime. This view was further developed in the "ER=EPR" conjecture, proposed by Juan Maldacena and Leonard Susskind, which posits a deep connection between Einstein-Rosen bridges (wormholes) and quantum entanglement.</p>
            <p>The core idea of the ER=EPR conjecture is that two entangled quantum systems can be connected by a wormhole. A wormhole is a tunnel predicted by general relativity that connects two distant regions of spacetime. According to this conjecture, quantum entanglement is not just a non-local correlation of quantum states but is realized through "shortcuts" in the structure of spacetime. This perspective provides a new way to understand the relationship between quantum entanglement and the structure of spacetime.</p>

            <h2>2. Potential Impacts of Relativity on Biological Evolution</h2>
            <p>Relativity and biological evolution seem to be two entirely different concepts. Relativity primarily explores the physical laws of the universe, especially the relationships between time, space, and gravity. Biological evolution, on the other hand, is a theory proposed by Darwin that describes how species evolve through natural selection and genetic variation. Despite the apparent disconnect between these fields, as science advances, people have begun to explore the potential impacts of relativity on biological evolution. This not only broadens our understanding of life sciences but also provides new perspectives for exploring extraterrestrial life.</p>
            <h3>Time Dilation and Biological Evolution</h3>
            <p>The time dilation effect in relativity states that time slows down in strong gravitational fields or at high speeds. This effect is particularly significant on a cosmic scale, such as near black holes or for particles approaching the speed of light. If applied to biological evolution, it can be imagined that in certain extreme environments, the rate of evolution might be abnormally slow or fast due to time dilation. For example, if a planet has a very strong gravitational field, the organisms on that planet might experience a "slow-motion" evolution, which could affect their physiological structure and adaptability.</p>
            <h3>Space Curvature and Species Distribution</h3>
            <p>Relativity also reveals the curvature of space, meaning that the geometric structure of space can vary significantly in different regions of the universe. This uneven distribution of space can affect the distribution and migration patterns of species. For example, in certain regions of the universe, due to the special curvature of space, species might more easily migrate to other galaxies through "shortcuts," which could accelerate intergalactic species exchange
