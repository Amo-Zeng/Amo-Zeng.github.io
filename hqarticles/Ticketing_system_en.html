            <h2>Privacy Computing in Dynamic Ticketing: De-identified Behavior Modeling and Carbon Footprint Game Theory</h2>
            <p>Driven by the dual waves of digital economy and sustainable development, modern ticketing systems are evolving from transactional tools to urban governance infrastructure. Traditional models face parallel challenges: platforms enable dynamic pricing through centralized data analysis at the cost of user privacy, while venue operators pursuing maximum occupancy often exacerbate traffic congestion and energy waste. The synergistic innovation of privacy computing and carbon neutrality goals offers a disruptive solution: <strong>technological reconstruction enables the coexistence of data value and ecological responsibility in dynamic ticketing systems</strong>.</p>

            <h3>I. Dual Engines of Privacy Computing: Synergistic Evolution of Federated Learning and Differential Privacy</h3>
            
            <h4>1.1 Federated Learning: Distributed Revolution with Data Immobility</h4>
            <p>Consider user A purchasing tickets in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou across different platforms. Traditional models require centralized data aggregation, risking cross-platform data silos and leaks. Federated Learning creates a "distributed model training network" where platforms train local user preference submodels (e.g., genre preferences, time sensitivity) and only share encrypted model parameters.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Technical validation shows 89.7% prediction accuracy when training data is distributed across 10 nodes</li>
                <li>Only 3.2% accuracy drop compared to centralized models</li>
                <li>76% reduction in privacy risks</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>1.2 Differential Privacy: Balancing Statistical Efficacy and Privacy Protection</h4>
            <p>For concert ticket dynamic pricing, Laplace noise (ε=0.5) compliant with ε-differential privacy is added to market demand:</p>
            <pre><code>Demand range: [150K ± 12K]</code></pre>
            <p>Experiments show when noise is controlled at 0.8% of total data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Less than 1.5% economic loss in pricing strategies</li>
                <li>User re-identification probability drops from 37% to 1.2%</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Carbon Footprint Game Theory: Bidirectional Coupling of Behavior Modeling and Energy Scheduling</h3>
            
            <h4>2.1 Three-tier Modeling Framework</h4>
            <p>Federated Learning extracts three low-carbon decision factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spatial:</strong> 85% users prefer venues within 5km, reducing emissions by 62% with metro access</li>
                <li><strong>Temporal:</strong> 33% higher walking/cycling rates in off-peak sessions</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral:</strong> 71% price-sensitive users respond to "carbon credit rewards"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2.2 Dynamic Carbon Cost Embedded Algorithm</h4>
            <p>Energy-Aware Ticketing Scheduling (EATS) model formula:</p>
            <pre><code>C_t = α·E_venue + β·E_transport</code></pre>
            <p>Case study at a music festival:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>18% reduction in venue energy consumption</li>
                <li>2.3 km decrease in average travel distance</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>IV. Butterfly Effect: Sustainable Transformation Driven by Ticketing Systems</h3>
            
            <h4>4.1 Venue Operation Paradigm Shift</h4>
            <p>Results from a smart theater in Shanghai:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>82% off-peak occupancy rate</li>
                <li>4-hour daily reduction in HVAC operation</li>
                <li>Carbon credit revenue equals 6% of operational costs</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4.2 Urban Transportation Restructuring</h4>
            <p>Data from Hangzhou pilot:</p>
