            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network technology, as a decentralized communication architecture, is demonstrating its potential for innovation across various fields. From the synchronization of distributed ledgers in blockchain, to efficient data transmission in Content Delivery Networks (CDN), and to the sustainable development of network ecosystems, P2P technology not only drives technological innovation but also prompts profound reflections in economics and ecology. This article will comprehensively explore the applications of P2P technology in these areas, analyze how it enhances system efficiency, security, and scalability, and discuss future development directions.</p>

            <h3>The Key Role of P2P in Blockchain</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Foundation of Decentralization:</strong><br>
            P2P networks are the core pillar of blockchain technology. Through a structure where each node acts both as a client and a server, blockchain operates without a central authority. Each participant holds a complete copy of the ledger, ensuring data redundancy and transparency.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Distributed Ledger Synchronization and Data Security:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Broadcasting Mechanism:</strong> New transactions or blocks are broadcasted through the network to all nodes, ensuring all participants have the latest information.</li>
                <li><strong>Node Discovery and Verification:</strong> Using P2P protocols, nodes can dynamically discover and connect with other nodes, simultaneously validating and syncing data.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Transmission:</strong> Data is protected during transmission through encryption technologies, with node identity verification and data integrity checks ensuring network security.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>3. New Consensus Mechanisms and Network Optimization:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PoS, DPoS, etc.:</strong> These mechanisms reduce energy consumption and enhance network efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Network Sharding and Topology Adjustment:</strong> By sharding the network or dynamically adjusting node connections, data propagation efficiency and network throughput are improved.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Innovative Applications of P2P in CDN</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Alleviating Pressure on Traditional CDN:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Users as Nodes:</strong> User devices become nodes, participating in content distribution, reducing dependency on central servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Load Balancing:</strong> Transmission tasks are dynamically allocated based on network conditions, enhancing overall network stability and efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>2. Economic Benefits and Efficiency Improvement:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lowering Traffic Costs:</strong> By reducing outgoing traffic from data centers, P2P networks significantly lower bandwidth costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Improving Content Delivery Efficiency:</strong> Shorter transmission paths and multi-source transmission strategies enhance real-time data delivery and transmission success rates.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>3. Integration with AI and Edge Computing:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intelligent Resource Scheduling:</strong> AI algorithms optimize node selection and resource allocation strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Edge Nodes:</strong> Pushing computational and storage capabilities to the network's edge reduces dependency on the core network, enhancing user experience.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
