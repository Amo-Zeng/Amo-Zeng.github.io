            <h2>Ecological Memorials and Sustainable Development</h2>
            <p>First, the design of memorial architecture is increasingly focusing on ecological sustainability. Traditional memorial architecture often emphasizes permanence and solidity, with materials and construction methods typically ignoring environmental impacts. However, modern memorial designs now consider their lifecycle within the environment. For example, using renewable materials, green building technologies, and ecological restoration projects, memorial sites not only serve as centers of human activity but also as part of the ecosystem. Through such designs, memorial architecture can reduce its environmental footprint while symbolizing the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature. This ecological memorial is not just a tribute to the past but a commitment to the future, pushing us towards a more sustainable memorial culture.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Interactive Memorials and Public Engagement</h2>
            <p>Secondly, the interactivity of memorial architecture breaks the one-way memorial model. Traditional memorials are primarily static displays where the audience is passive. However, modern memorial architecture, through digital technologies, interactive installations, and participatory design, allows the public to engage more actively with the commemoration. For instance, using AR (Augmented Reality) and VR (Virtual Reality), visitors can delve deeper into the background and details of events, or even participate in the creation of memorial activities. This interaction not only enhances the visitor's experience but also makes the commemoration more vivid and educational. In this way, memorial architecture transforms from a mere monument into a continuous dialogue space, sparking reflection and discussion on history, culture, and social issues among the public.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Cultural Fusion and Transboundary Memory</h2>
            <p>Lastly, the application of cultural fusion in memorial architecture respects and showcases diverse cultural identities. As society becomes more diverse, memorial architecture is no longer confined to expressing a single culture but serves as a guardian of memories across cultural boundaries. For example, in the context of globalization, memorial architecture can integrate elements from different cultures to tell cross-border historical stories, themes like migration, war, and peace. Such memorial architecture is not just local but global in its memory-bearing capacity, fostering understanding and reconciliation through intercultural exchange. This culturally fused memorial architecture is not just a construction of physical space but a confluence of emotions and memories, helping us understand the shared human experience across different cultural backgrounds.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Considering the above three points, the role of memorial architecture in the new era has far exceeded its original function. It is not merely a witness to history but also an ecological participant, an interactive creator, and a cultural integrator. Through these innovations, memorial architecture not only commemorates the past but also provides a platform for reflection and action for the future. This transformation makes memorial architecture a vibrant and profound new cultural form in modern society, guiding us to commemorate and understand our history and culture in more meaningful ways.</p>

            <h2>Optimization Suggestions:</h2>
            <p>1. **Clarify Structure**: Use subheadings at the beginning of each paragraph to make the structure clearer, allowing readers to quickly grasp the themes.</p>
            <p>2. **Include Technical Terms**: Mention terms like "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)" in the ecology section, "User Experience Design (UX Design)" in the interaction section, to enhance professionalism.</p>
            <p>3. **Data Support**: Incorporate data or case studies to strengthen the argumentation's persuasiveness.</p>
            <p>4. **Refine Language**: While maintaining fluency, streamline redundant expressions to make the article more concise and powerful.</p>
            <p>5. **Visual Support**: If possible, add charts or images to visually demonstrate examples of ecological design, interactive experiences, and cultural fusion.</p>
