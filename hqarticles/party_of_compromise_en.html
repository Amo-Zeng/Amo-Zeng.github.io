            <h2>The Evolution of the Centrist: From Ambiguity to Diversity</h2>
            <p>For a long time, "centrists" have been labeled as "ambiguous" and "lacking principles," as if they were "fence-sitters" swaying uncertainly on the political spectrum. However, this stereotype overlooks the dynamic evolution of centrism in social change. In fact, as social issues evolve and new groups emerge, the definition and composition of centrism are not static but constantly evolving, presenting new faces and forces.</p>
