            <h2>Green Technology: From Technological Domination to a Circular Future of Pluralism and Coexistence</h2>
            <p>In the context of escalating global climate crises, green technology, environmental discourse, and circular economy are emerging as the three core issues in addressing environmental challenges. However, beneath these seemingly promising solutions lie complex ecological, societal, and cultural challenges. It is essential to re-examine these topics through a deeper lens to explore a truly sustainable path forward.</p>

            <h3>The Double-Edged Sword of Green Technology: Environmental Costs and Resource Equity</h3>
            <p>Green technology is widely regarded as a key solution to climate change, but its production processes hide significant environmental costs. Take electric vehicles and photovoltaic technology as examples—they reduce carbon emissions, but their reliance on rare elements like rare earths, lithium, and cobalt has caused severe ecological damage and social issues.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ecological Damage:</strong> Cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has polluted water sources and degraded ecosystems.</li>
                <li><strong>Human Rights Concerns:</strong> Child labor and poor working conditions are common in the extraction of critical materials.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Disparities:</strong> The environmental burden of producing green technologies often shifts to resource-exporting developing countries.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Green technology must be assessed across its entire life cycle to avoid transferring ecological and social burdens to other regions and future generations.</p>
        </section>

            <h3>Conclusion: Toward an Environmental Future of Pluralism and Coexistence</h3>
            <p>Green technology, environmental discourse, and circular economy are vital tools for addressing environmental challenges, but they are not miracle solutions. We must move beyond the simplistic equation of “technology equals sustainability” and acknowledge the complex environmental and social impacts embedded in every technology.</p>
            <p>Only by taking a full life-cycle perspective of green innovation, balancing technological progress with resource equity, can we achieve true harmony between humanity and nature. At the same time, we need to build a more pluralistic, inclusive, and context-sensitive global ecological worldview, allowing diverse cultural traditions of sustainability to contribute to global environmental protection.</p>
            <p>In our pursuit of a green future, we must consider not only short-term benefits but also the long-term and systemic impacts. Only in doing so can green technology, environmental discourse, and the circular economy truly become drivers of sustainable development, rather than sources of new environmental problems.</p>
