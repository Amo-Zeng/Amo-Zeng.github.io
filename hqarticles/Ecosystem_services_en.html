            <h2>Economic Resilience and Ecosystem Services</h2>
            <p>Ecosystem services not only provide foundational conditions but can also be viewed as an ecological economic model. This model highlights how inputs of natural capital can maximize economic output while minimizing environmental impact. For example, using natural biological control mechanisms, like introducing natural enemies to reduce pests, reduces chemical usage and facilitates a green transition in agriculture.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ecological Economic Models in Agriculture and Fisheries:</strong> Reducing environmental burden through natural biological control mechanisms.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Evaluation of Ecosystem Services:</strong> Incorporating ecosystem services into economic evaluation frameworks to promote policy formulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecosystem Services and Economic Risk Management:</strong> The buffering role of ecosystem services in economic risk management.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Cultural Value and Psychological Health</h2>
            <p>Ecosystems are not just cultural backgrounds but also integral parts of cultural capital. They preserve the genes of human history, beliefs, and traditions, providing unique cultural landscapes and intangible cultural heritage, which are crucial for cultural identity and place branding.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ecosystems as Cultural Capital:</strong> Preserving the genes of human culture.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecopsychology and Environmental Therapy:</strong> Providing resources for psychological health.</li>
                <li><strong>Building Cultural Ecosystems:</strong> Introducing concepts that merge culture and nature in urban planning.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Genetic Resources and Biotechnology</h2>
            <p>Ecosystem services provide a wealth of resources for gene banks, supporting global gene diversity conservation initiatives. These gene banks are not only repositories of biodiversity but also sources for future biotechnological innovations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ecosystem Services and Gene Bank Development:</strong> Supporting gene diversity conservation programs.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecosystem Services and Bioethics:</strong> Balancing scientific advancement with nature conservation.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecosystem Services and Ecological Restoration:</strong> Utilizing genetic resources to enhance the efficiency of ecological restoration.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conservation Measures and Future Outlook</h2>
            <p>Exploring payment mechanisms for ecosystem services, such as PES (Payment for Ecosystem Services), can provide economic incentives, making ecosystem conservation a sustainable economic activity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Payment Mechanisms for Ecosystem Services:</strong> Providing economic incentives to promote conservation.</li>
                <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Policy Innovation:</strong> Driving policy innovation to ensure the importance of ecosystem services in policy-making.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Transformation of Ecosystem Services:</strong> Utilizing technologies like big data to enhance conservation efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Ecosystem services are not only guardians of the natural environment but also catalysts for economic, cultural, and technological development. Through a deep understanding and innovative application, we can achieve a more sustainable, healthy, and vibrant society.</p>
