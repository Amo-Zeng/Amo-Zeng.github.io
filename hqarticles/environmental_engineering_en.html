            <h2>The Necessity of Technology Integration in Environmental Issues</h2>
            <p>Environmental issues are becoming increasingly severe, and traditional end-of-pipe treatment models are no longer sufficient to address the complex and ever-changing challenges. Humanity urgently needs to explore a sustainable development path that integrates cutting-edge technologies and drives ecological reconstruction. Future environmental engineering will leverage technological innovation as its engine, deeply integrating emerging fields such as biotechnology, big data and artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology. This integration will drive environmental governance models from "pollution treatment" to "ecological restoration," building a healthier, more resilient, and sustainable ecosystem.</p>

            <h3>1. Biotechnology: Source Governance and Green Ecology Construction</h3>
            <p>Biotechnology will become one of the core driving forces of environmental engineering, reshaping pollution treatment models and promoting a shift from "end-of-pipe treatment" to "source governance."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microbial Degradation:</strong> Utilizing gene engineering techniques to design and modify high-efficiency degradation strains, capable of rapidly and thoroughly decomposing various persistent organic pollutants, such as pesticide residues and toxic substances in industrial wastewater, eliminating pollution at the source.</li>
                <li><strong>Phytoremediation:</strong> Planting hyperaccumulative plants, such as As-hyperaccumulator S. oldhamii, to effectively absorb heavy metal pollutants in the soil, achieving soil remediation and restoring ecological balance.</li>
                <li><strong>Synthetic Biology:</strong> Through synthetic biology technology, microbial organisms can be designed and modified to efficiently convert waste into high-value products such as biofuels and bioplastics, achieving "turning waste into treasure," promoting green manufacturing, and reducing dependence on fossil resources.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Big Data and Artificial Intelligence: Empowering Precision Governance and Enhancing Decision Efficiency</h3>
            <p>Big data and artificial intelligence will provide strong data support and technical means for environmental governance, promoting environmental management towards precision and intelligence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Precision Monitoring and Early Warning:</strong> Utilizing sensor networks and artificial intelligence algorithms, real-time monitoring and precise analysis of environmental parameters such as air, water, and soil can be achieved, predicting the probability and impact range of pollution events in advance, providing early warning information for environmental management departments, and achieving precision pollution control.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Environmental Governance:</strong> Using machine learning algorithms to accurately analyze pollution sources, constructing environmental carrying capacity assessment models, providing scientific basis for environmental governance plan formulation, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing environmental governance efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Prediction and Prevention:</strong> Analyzing historical and real-time data to identify patterns and laws of environmental risk occurrence, establishing prediction models, and taking preventive measures in advance to enhance society's ability to respond to environmental risks.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>3. Blockchain Technology: Ensuring Data Trustworthiness and Promoting Green Development</h3>
            <p>Blockchain technology will provide a secure, transparent, and trustworthy data foundation for environmental governance, promoting the transparency and credibility of environmental management.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Trustworthy Sharing:</strong> Utilizing blockchain technology, environmental data can be made tamper-proof and traceable, ensuring data authenticity and credibility, providing reliable data support for environmental governance.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparent Green Supply Chain Management:</strong> Achieving information traceability of the entire product lifecycle through blockchain technology, ensuring transparent management of all supply chain links, enhancing corporate green competitiveness, and promoting the green transformation of the industrial chain.</li>
                <li><strong>Fair and Transparent Carbon Emission Trading:</strong> Using blockchain technology to build a fair and transparent carbon emission trading mechanism, ensuring the fairness and transparency of transactions, promoting the healthy development of the carbon emission trading market, and contributing to the realization of global carbon reduction targets.</li>
            </ul>
