            <h2>The Digital Wave of the Music Industry: From Copyright Protection to Decentralized Innovation</h2>
            <p>In the digital era, the music industry is experiencing unprecedented transformations. Technological advancements are not only changing the way music is created, distributed, and consumed, but also posing new challenges to traditional copyright protection systems. From "digital fingerprints" to "vocal prints," from music crowdfunding to NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), technology has provided new tools and ideas for music copyright protection, and has also brought opportunities and challenges for the adaptation and innovation of the legal system.</p>

            <h3>I. Technology Empowers Music Copyright Protection: From "Digital Fingerprints" to "Vocal Prints"</h3>
            <p>Music copyright protection has long faced issues such as piracy, unauthorized secondary creations, and misuse through techniques like transposition and editing. Traditional "digital fingerprint" technology identifies unauthorized copying and distribution by extracting and comparing digital characteristic codes in audio files. However, this technology has obvious limitations: it is easily tampered with and difficult to trace the origin.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the rise of "vocal print" technology has provided new solutions for music copyright protection. By extracting unique voice features of singers, such as pitch, timbre, and formants, a unique soundprint database is constructed. Compared to "digital fingerprints," "vocal prints" have stronger anti-interference and precise traceability. Even if a song is adapted, its authenticity can still be identified through voice features and traced back to its original source, providing strong evidence support for copyright attribution.</p>
            <h4>Application Scenarios:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vocal Print Library Construction:</strong> Establish a comprehensive vocal print library, collecting voice features of well-known singers and even independent musicians, providing reliable evidence for the copyright attribution of songs.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic Identification and Labeling of Music Works:</strong> Using "vocal print" technology combined with artificial intelligence, automatically identify and label music works on online platforms, identifying unauthorized versions and taking timely action to remove them.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing the Evidence Chain for Infringement:</strong> "Vocal print" technology can be combined with other forms of evidence to form a complete evidence chain, providing stronger legal support for combating piracy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Regulatory Challenges of Music Crowdfunding: From "Powered by Love" to "Copyright Co-Governance"</h3>
            <p>With the普及 of the internet and the transformation of music consumption patterns, music crowdfunding has emerged as a new financing method, offering independent musicians an opportunity to bypass traditional record companies and raise funds directly from fans for creation. However, the increase in crowdfunded album projects has also brought issues such as copyright attribution and profit distribution, sparking thoughts on "copyright co-governance."</p>
            <h4>Legal Risks:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unclear Copyright Attribution:</strong> Do crowdfunding participants have partial rights to the song's copyright? Does the crowdfunding platform have the copyright? These issues are not clearly defined in law, easily leading to copyright disputes.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency in Profit Distribution:</strong> How are crowdfunding proceeds distributed? How are the profits of musicians, platforms, and fans defined? The lack of transparent and open distribution mechanisms easily leads to conflicts of interest.</li>
                <li><strong>Blurring of Platform Responsibilities:</strong> The role of the crowdfunding platform in project operations is unclear, whether it is merely an information intermediary or bears certain regulatory responsibilities. The lack of clear platform responsibility definitions means that once infringement occurs, the platform faces significant legal risks.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>"Copyright Co-Governance" Model:</h4>
            <p>"Copyright co-governance" advocates for opening up part of the music copyright to crowdfunding participants, forming a new copyright governance structure where musicians and fans jointly own copyright and share profits.</p>
            <h5>Advantages:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Fan Engagement:</strong> Fans are no longer just consumers but become co-creators in the music creation process, owning part of the copyright and sharing the profits of the work, increasing fan engagement and stickiness.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting Music Distribution:</strong> The "copyright co-governance" model can motivate fans to actively promote music works, reducing the cost of music promotion for musicians and benefiting the distribution and value enhancement of music works.</li>
                <li><strong>Balancing Interests:</strong> The "copyright co-governance" model can balance the interests of musicians, platforms, and fans, establishing a fairer and more transparent profit distribution mechanism, reducing the occurrence of copyright disputes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Challenges:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lagging Legal System Construction:</strong> The "copyright co-governance" model requires a robust legal system, including copyright sharing, profit distribution, and platform regulatory systems. The existing legal system is not yet perfect, making it difficult to effectively support the implementation of the "copyright co-governance" model.</li>
                <li><strong>Insufficient Platform Technical Capabilities:</strong> The "copyright co-governance" model requires platforms to have strong technical capabilities, such as smart contracts and blockchain technology, to ensure clear copyright attribution and transparent profit distribution. Currently, most music crowdfunding platforms lack the necessary technical capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Weak Public Copyright Awareness:</strong> The public's understanding of copyright is still at the consumer level, and the concept of copyright sharing is unfamiliar. It is necessary to strengthen copyright education and enhance the public's copyright awareness.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>III. The Legal Boundaries of Music NFTs: Virtual Commodities or Digital Assets?</h3>
            <p>The rise of NFT technology has brought unprecedented changes to the music industry. The emergence of music NFTs has made the copyright authentication and transaction of music works more convenient and transparent, and has also provided musicians with a new profit model. However, the resulting legal issues have also sparked widespread controversy and thought, such as: What is the legal nature of music NFTs? Are their transactions protected by copyright law?</p>
            <h4>Technical Characteristics:</h4>
            <p>NFTs are digital tokens based on blockchain technology, each unique, indivisible, and irreplaceable. Music NFTs usually exist in the form of digital files, such as audio files, video files, etc., and record relevant information about the music works, such as the creator, creation time, and copyright attribution.</p>
            <h4>Legal Nature:</h4>
            <p>Regarding the legal nature of music NFTs, there are mainly the following perspectives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Virtual Commodity Theory:</strong> Music NFTs are virtual commodities, representing ownership certificates of specific digital music works. The ownership of music NFTs belongs to the buyer, but the buyer does not acquire the copyright of the music work, only the right to use the work.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Asset Theory:</strong> Music NFTs are digital assets, representing unique ownership of specific digital music works. Both the ownership and the right to use the music NFT belong to the buyer, but the copyright of the work still belongs to the creator.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Rights Theory:</strong> Music NFTs represent a special right, different from traditional ownership and copyright. This special right grants the buyer exclusive use of the digital music work but does not equate to the transfer of copyright.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Legal Improvement Suggestions:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clarify the Legal Nature of Music NFTs:</strong> Legislative authorities should promptly clarify the legal nature of music NFTs, clarifying the relationship between them and traditional ownership and copyright, providing legal basis for the transaction and use of music NFTs.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulate Music NFT Transaction Behavior:</strong> Formulate special regulations to regulate the operation of music NFT trading platforms, clarify the responsibilities of platforms in copyright protection, information disclosure, and fund supervision, ensuring the legitimate rights and interests of both parties in the transaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Establish a Copyright Registration System for Music NFTs:</strong> Draw on the advantages of blockchain technology to establish a copyright registration system for music NFTs, achieving transparency and traceability of music work copyright information, providing reliable evidence support for copyright protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthen Copyright Protection:</strong> Intensify the crackdown on piracy and infringement of music NFTs, safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of musicians, and creating a good environment for music creation and digital copyright protection.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>In the digital wave, the music industry is moving towards a more open, diverse, and decentralized direction. Technological progress has provided new tools and ideas for music copyright protection, bringing opportunities and challenges for the adaptation and innovation of the legal system. From "digital fingerprints" to "vocal prints," from music crowdfunding to NFTs, technological iterations have not only changed the way music is created, distributed, and consumed, but also posed new challenges to traditional copyright protection systems. Clarifying the legal nature of music NFTs, regulating their transaction behavior, and strengthening copyright protection are key to promoting the healthy development of music NFTs. With the continuous improvement of laws and regulations, it is believed that music NFTs will bring more broad development space to the music industry, promoting the digital transformation and innovative development of the music industry.</p>
