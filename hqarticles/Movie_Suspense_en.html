            <h2>Narrative Labyrinth of Mystery Films: Challenges and Enjoyment</h2>
            <p>Mystery films, with their unique narrative structures and intricate plot designs, often lead the audience into a challenging "narrative labyrinth." Through techniques such as non-linear storytelling, multiple perspectives, and time distortion, directors construct complex puzzles that force the audience to act like detectives, unraveling the truth from a web of intricate clues. This process of solving the puzzle itself is an intellectual challenge and a source of enjoyment.</p>
