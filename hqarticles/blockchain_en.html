In recent years, events such as the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal and Google's location data leak have triggered profound reflections on <strong>personal data sovereignty</strong>. Fortunately, blockchain technology offers a new solution, reshaping privacy and trust in the digital age.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decentralized Identity (DID): The Foundation of Personal Data Sovereignty</strong>  
                    In traditional internet, personal identity information is usually managed by centralized institutions, and users cannot fully control their own data. Blockchain-driven <strong>Decentralized Identity (DID)</strong> technology empowers users to manage their digital identities autonomously. Users can create and manage their digital identities independently and selectively disclose and verify information without relying on third-party intermediaries. With blockchain's immutability, DID ensures the authenticity and security of identity information, effectively preventing <strong>identity theft and information tampering</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Zero-Knowledge Proof: The Privacy Guardian of Data Access</strong>  
                    In data-sharing scenarios, privacy protection is a key issue. Traditional data-sharing models require users to fully disclose sensitive information, increasing the risk of privacy leakage. <strong>Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)</strong> technology allows users to prove that they possess certain data or meet certain conditions without revealing specific information. For example, users can prove they are over 18 without disclosing their exact birth date. This technology greatly enhances the privacy and security of data sharing, laying the foundation for a fairer and more transparent data collaboration model.</li>
                <li><strong>Blockchain Redefining Data Ownership: Challenges and Opportunities</strong>  
                    The rise of blockchain technology is disrupting traditional data ownership models and having a profound impact on internet giants and the advertising industry:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Decentralized Data Market:</strong> Blockchain technology can build a decentralized data market where users can encrypt their data on the blockchain and conduct secure, transparent transactions with data demanders through smart contracts. Users are no longer just data providers but <strong>true data owners</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Privacy Computing:</strong> Combining privacy computing with blockchain, data can be securely shared and mined while protecting privacy. For example, <strong>Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)</strong> allows multiple parties to conduct data analysis and model training without revealing their respective data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transformation of the Advertising Industry:</strong> Decentralized advertising platforms based on blockchain can create a more transparent and fair advertising ecosystem, reducing ad fraud and data abuse, and providing more accurate and high-quality ad services for users.</li>
                    </ul>
