            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>At the intersection of modern science, environmental simulation, cell culture, and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are merging, creating unprecedented prospects for research and application. Cells, as the basic units of life, offer a rich field for scientific exploration due to their adaptability and dynamism. By simulating various extreme environments, studying how cells adapt to these conditions not only helps understand the potential for life beyond Earth but also drives innovations in cell culture technology. The introduction of AI brings intelligent optimization and predictive capabilities, prompting us to re-evaluate the boundaries of life, technology, and art.</p>
