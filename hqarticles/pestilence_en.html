            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In today's context of rapid globalization and digitalization, the speed and scope of infectious disease transmission have reached unprecedented levels. Social network analysis (SNA), climate change, and digital health technologies provide us with multidimensional tools to understand, predict, and manage the spread of infectious diseases. This article explores how these fields interact to form a comprehensive strategy for addressing global public health challenges.</p>

            <h3>Social Network Analysis and Disease Spread</h3>
            <p>Social Network Analysis, as a discipline that studies relationships between individuals, plays a crucial role in infectious disease control. Here's how SNA helps manage infectious diseases effectively:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic Concepts</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Degree Centrality</strong>: Identifies individuals with high influence in the network, who might be key nodes in disease transmission.</li>
                        <li><strong>Betweenness Centrality</strong>: Determines nodes that control the flow of information or viruses, allowing for isolation or special monitoring measures.</li>
                        <li><strong>Clustering Coefficient</strong>: Assesses the degree of clustering among nodes, helping predict disease spread within communities.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Propagation Models</strong>:
                    <p>Using SIR and SEIR models to simulate disease spread in different network structures, aiding in the formulation of effective control strategies.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Case Studies</strong>:
                    <p>Analyzing the transmission networks of the 2003 SARS outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic to identify key transmission nodes and paths, enabling effective isolation and control measures.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Strategies and Interventions</strong>:
                    <p>Node isolation, network disruption, and priority vaccine allocation based on SNA effectively control disease spread.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Impact of Climate Change on Disease Spread</h3>
            <p>Climate change affects infectious disease transmission through the following mechanisms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Changes in Temperature and Precipitation Patterns</strong>: Alters pathogen growth conditions and the activity period of vectors like mosquitoes and ticks, expanding the spread of certain diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Extreme Weather Events</strong>: Floods, hurricanes, etc., can disrupt public health infrastructure, facilitating rapid disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecosystem Changes</strong>: The reduction of biodiversity and migration of hosts can introduce diseases into new areas.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Response Strategies</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strengthen global and regional disease surveillance networks, integrating climate data for early warnings.</li>
                <li>Enhance the disaster resilience of public health infrastructure.</li>
                <li>Promote international cooperation to address cross-border disease transmission.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Application of Digital Health in Infectious Disease Management</h3>
            <p>Digital technology provides revolutionary tools for managing infectious diseases:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Early Warning</strong>: Uses big data analysis, IoT, and AI for early detection and prediction of diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Telemedicine</strong>: Offers remote diagnosis and treatment, reducing contact risks and optimizing resource utilization.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Health Management</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Utilizes digital models to simulate epidemic spread and assess the effectiveness of control measures.</li>
                        <li>Digital vaccine management systems ensure effective distribution and administration of vaccines.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Future Prospects and Challenges</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Addressing data privacy and security issues is crucial.</li>
                <li>Technological adoption and education are key to promoting digital health.</li>
                <li>Regulatory and ethical issues need to balance individual privacy with public health.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Integrated Strategies and Future Development</h3>
            <p>Combining social network analysis, the impacts of climate change, and digital health technologies, we can formulate the following integrated strategies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Monitoring and Prediction</strong>: Use SNA and AI for real-time monitoring and prediction, integrating climate data for early epidemic warnings.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-layered Control</strong>: Implement targeted control measures at individual, community, and global levels, considering the dynamics of social relationships and environmental changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Innovation and Collaboration</strong>: Through international cooperation and interdisciplinary approaches, drive technological innovation to ensure a swift and effective response to epidemics globally.</li>
            </ul>
