            <h2>Experience and Interaction Design: Reshaping the Future of Design Museums</h2>
            <p>In the wave of the digital era, design museums are no longer just static display spaces but are gradually transforming into dynamic interactive platforms. By introducing Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and interactive installations, design museums not only provide immersive visiting experiences but also allow visitors to directly engage in the design process, thus deepening their understanding of design principles and history.</p>

            <h3>The Fusion of VR and Design</h3>
            <p>Virtual Reality technology offers an unprecedented way to showcase designs. For example, the Design Museum in London once launched a VR exhibition called "Future Homes." Visitors could experience various possibilities of future smart homes through VR headsets, from the automatic adjustment of smart furniture to the full control of home automation systems, making them feel as if they were living in a future environment. This experience not only gave visitors a direct perception of future design trends but also sparked their interest in technological innovation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Case:</strong> The "Future Homes" VR exhibition at the London Design Museum not only demonstrated how future technology could integrate into daily life but also allowed visitors to manipulate objects in the virtual environment through gesture controls. Visitors could adjust room lighting, rearrange furniture, and even converse with virtual assistants. This interactivity not only enhanced the immersive experience but also provided insights into the possibilities of future design.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Feedback from visitors showed that 85% felt the VR experience offered unprecedented insights into design, with 90% expressing a desire to continue using such technology in future museum visits.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Application of AR - Augmented Reality</h3>
            <p>Augmented Reality acts as a bridge in design museums, blending virtual design with the real world. The Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris uses AR technology when displaying ancient furniture, allowing visitors to see through a mobile app how these pieces would look in a modern home setting. This technology not only enhances the visual appeal of the exhibits but also helps visitors understand the historical evolution and modern applications of design.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Case:</strong> The Musée des Arts Décoratifs uses an AR application allowing visitors to view how antique furniture would function in a modern environment via mobile devices. Through AR, visitors can see interactions between antique furniture and modern settings, like how an 18th-century dining table might fit with contemporary table settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Feedback indicated that 75% of visitors believed AR technology helped them better understand the history and development of design, and 60% found it increased their interest in the exhibits.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Design of Interactive Installations</h3>
            <p>Interactive installations bring visitors even closer to the design. The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York once held an exhibition with interactive installations where visitors were invited to design their own product prototypes via touch screens. This design process not only let visitors experience the thought process of designers but also allowed them to see their designs come to life in a virtual space.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Case:</strong> MoMA's interactive installation enabled visitors to select materials, colors, and shapes through a touch screen to design their own lamps or furniture. After design, visitors could see how their creations interacted with other pieces in the virtual environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> 92% of visitors felt that this interactive installation made them feel part of the design process, with 80% believing that the experience sparked their creativity and interest in design.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Analysis of Visitor Feedback</h3>
            <p>By collecting visitor feedback, these interactive designs can be further optimized. For instance, after launching a VR exhibition, a design museum conducted a survey, which showed that over 80% of visitors found the VR experience novel and engaging, especially among younger audiences. Feedback on AR exhibitions was also positive, with many visitors feeling that this technology enhanced their understanding and interest in the exhibits. Interactive installations received widespread acclaim, with many visitors feeling they were truly involved in the creative process of design.</p>
            <p>Through these technological means, design museums not only enhance the depth and breadth of visitor experiences but also successfully transform traditional exhibition spaces into vibrant, innovative interactive platforms. This transformation not only attracts a younger audience but also provides new models and possibilities for design education. The future of design museums will become even more exciting and diverse due to the integration of these digital technologies.</p>
