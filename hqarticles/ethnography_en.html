            <h2>Cross-Border and Reverse in the Digital Age: Cultural Reconstruction and Identity Reshaping from a Multidimensional Perspective</h2>
            <p>Under the rapid development of digital technology and the wave of globalization, the cultural forms and ethnic interaction patterns of human society are undergoing unprecedented transformations. The traditional ethnographic research paradigm, centered on fieldwork, focuses on the material and spiritual lives of specific cultural groups. However, with the rise of virtual spaces and frequent cross-border flows, the ways of expressing cultural practices and ethnic identities have undergone profound changes. This article attempts to organically integrate the research perspectives of digital ethnography, cross-border ethnography, and reverse ethnography to explore how culture is reconstructed, ethnic identities are reshaped, and how rural culture finds its adaptive path in the process of modernization, under the multiple influences of digital technology, cross-border flows, and urbanization.</p>

            <h3>I. Cultural Reconstruction and Ethnic Identity in Virtual Spaces</h3>
            <p>The popularization of digital technology has brought cultural practices and expressions of ethnic identity into virtual spaces. Social media, online games, and virtual communities provide unprecedented possibilities for cultural dissemination and ethnic interaction. Traditional geographical and cultural boundaries have become increasingly blurred under the impact of digital technology, and expressions of ethnic identity have shown characteristics of fluidity and diversification.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Cultural Practices:</strong> Virtual reality technology can transform intangible cultural heritage into immersive experiences, allowing audiences to "attend" the Miao's Flower Festival or the Dong's Grand Song Meeting.</li>
                <li><strong>Diversified Cultural Identity:</strong> Cultural interactions in online games and virtual communities promote understanding and exchange among ethnic groups, offering new possibilities for cultural innovation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Cultural Hybridization and Identity Reconstruction in Cross-Border Flows</h3>
            <p>In the context of globalization, borders are no longer barriers to culture but rather ties of cultural interweaving. Cross-border marriages, transnational labor, and border trade bring not only economic interactions but also deep cultural blending.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cross-Border Marriages:</strong> In the Yunnan border area, cross-border marriages between Dai girls and Myanmar youths blend the joy of the Dai Water Splashing Festival with the solemnity of Myanmar Buddhism, creating a unique family cultural identity.</li>
                <li><strong>Transnational Labor:</strong> Transnational workers maintain contact with their families through mobile apps, with mixed languages, blended cuisines, and hybridized festival customs reshaping their cultural identity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>III. Rural Cultural Self-Narrative and Value Reconstruction Under Urbanization</h3>
            <p>The urbanization wave is sweeping the globe, and rural societies are experiencing unprecedented dramatic changes. However, reverse ethnographic studies show that rural culture is not passively bearing the impact of urbanization and globalization. Instead, it is adjusting and reconstructing its values through cultural revitalization, demonstrating unique cultural resilience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Innovation in Cultural Revitalization:</strong> Rural communities reinterpret traditions, imbuing them with new contemporary meanings. Traditional festivals, while maintaining core rituals, incorporate modern elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Building:</strong> Through spontaneous cultural activities and community participation, rural residents regain cultural confidence, forming cohesive cultural identities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>IV. Cultural Reconstruction and Identity Reshaping from a Multidimensional Perspective</h3>
            <p>Virtual spaces in the digital age, cross-border flows in the context of globalization, and rural cultural revitalization under the urbanization wave together form a multidimensional landscape of contemporary cultural reconstruction and ethnic identity reshaping. Virtual spaces provide new platforms for cultural practices and ethnic interaction, cross-border flows promote deep cultural blending and identity reconstruction, and rural culture demonstrates strong cultural creativity and adaptability through self-narrative and value reconstruction.</p>
