            <h2>The Modern Evolution of Feng Shui: Harmony in Digital Life, Indoor Plants, and Sustainable Design</h2>
            <p>Feng Shui, the ancient Chinese philosophical system, has long been dedicated to guiding humans to live in harmony with their natural environment. With the rapid development of technology and the rise of sustainable lifestyles, the application of Feng Shui is evolving and expanding into digital realms, indoor plant arrangements, and sustainable design. This modern integration not only preserves traditional wisdom but also provides a more harmonious, healthy, and sustainable living environment for modern individuals.</p>

            <h3>Digital Feng Shui Layout: New Wisdom for Modern Life</h3>
            <p>In today's world where digital devices are increasingly prevalent, digital Feng Shui layout has become an innovative and practical guide for modern living. By applying traditional Feng Shui principles to digital living spaces, such as computer desktops, smartphone screens, and application layouts, we can not only enhance work efficiency but also achieve balance and harmony on a spiritual level. For instance, placing frequently used applications and files in specific screen orientations, such as financial apps in the "wealth corner," health apps in the "health corner," and adopting color schemes that align with the Five Elements theory for interface design, are effective ways to improve digital Feng Shui.</p>

            <h3>Modern Integration of Feng Shui and Indoor Plants: Creating Harmonious Living Spaces</h3>
            <p>Combining modern horticultural techniques with traditional Feng Shui principles, indoor plant layout not only beautifies our living spaces but also contributes to the physical and mental well-being of residents. Selecting plants with specific Feng Shui meanings, such as bamboo symbolizing growth and flexibility, suitable for placement in the "growth corner" or study; and pothos symbolizing wealth and prosperity, ideal for the financial area or entrance. The choice and arrangement of plants should follow Feng Shui principles, ensuring they do not obstruct the natural flow of energy, while also considering the growth habits and light requirements of the plants to ensure their healthy growth.</p>

            <h3>Combination of Feng Shui and Sustainable Design: Building Green Harmonious Spaces</h3>
            <p>In the context of the pursuit of sustainable development, combining the principles of Feng Shui with modern sustainable design concepts helps create healthier and more efficient living environments, and contributes to environmental protection. When designing homes or offices, consider using recyclable materials and energy-saving equipment, such as reclaimed wood, eco-friendly paints, and energy-efficient lighting. Ensure the layout of the space adheres to Feng Shui principles, such as flowing energy paths, appropriate window locations to introduce natural light and fresh air. Utilize natural ventilation and passive solar design to reduce reliance on artificial lighting and air conditioning systems, thereby lowering energy consumption and carbon emissions.</p>
