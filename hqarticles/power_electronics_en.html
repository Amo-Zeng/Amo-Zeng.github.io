            <h3>Traditional Perspective: The Core Mission of Power Electronics</h3>
            <p>From a traditional perspective, the core function of power electronics technology is the efficient conversion and precise control of different forms of electrical energy. Whether it's converting high-voltage alternating current (AC) to low-voltage direct current (DC) or adjusting the speed of electric motors through variable frequency technology, power electronics technology is ubiquitous in industrial production and daily life. Its applications span from household appliances to large industrial equipment, ensuring efficient utilization and stable supply of electricity in various scenarios.</p>
            <p>In traditional applications, the goal of power electronics technology is to enhance energy efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and optimize system performance. For example, in electric vehicles, the power electronics system is responsible for converting DC from batteries into AC needed to drive the motor, with precise control for efficient energy management. In wind power generation, power electronics technology is used to convert unstable AC into stable DC, ensuring the stable operation of the power grid.</p>
            <p>However, with technological advancement and the rise of new application fields, the scenarios of power electronics technology are undergoing profound changes, evolving from a simple energy conversion tool to a core technology supporting artificial intelligence, the virtual world, and the field of acoustics.</p>
