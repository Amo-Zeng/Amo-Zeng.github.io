            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Traditional customer segmentation methods, such as those based on demographic, geographic, and behavioral information, have helped businesses understand their customers to some extent. However, these methods often treat customers as static groups, overlooking individual differences and dynamic changes. With the rapid development of big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies, customer segmentation is undergoing a profound transformation from "passive satisfaction" to "proactive leadership." This shift not only changes the way businesses interact with customers but also gives businesses a competitive edge in the market. This article will explore the comprehensive upgrade of customer segmentation strategies from three new perspectives: "personalization," "multidimensional panorama," and "proactive leadership," with practical case analyses of their impact on businesses.</p>

            <h2>1. From "Humanization" to "Personalization": Focusing on Individual Differences</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Limitations of Traditional Customer Segmentation</h3>
            <p>Traditional customer segmentation methods primarily rely on static data, such as age, gender, location, and purchase history. While these data points help businesses understand basic customer characteristics, they fail to capture individual needs, preferences, and pain points.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Technology-Driven Personalized Segmentation</h3>
            <p>The core of modern customer segmentation strategies lies in focusing on individual differences. Through big data and AI technologies, businesses can deeply explore each customer's personalized needs, preferences, and pain points.</p>
