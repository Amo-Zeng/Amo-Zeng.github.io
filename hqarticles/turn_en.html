            <h3>The Deep Integration of Artificial Intelligence and Turning Technology: From Tool to Intelligent System</h3>
            <p>In the wave of Industry 4.0, artificial intelligence is no longer merely an "auxiliary tool" in manufacturing; it has become the core engine driving the transformation of turning technology towards intelligence. The rise of intelligent turning represents not just an upgrade in technology but a profound shift in manufacturing paradigms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The core of intelligent turning lies in endowing traditional lathes with "intelligent" capabilities.</strong> Through machine learning and deep learning technologies, turning systems can real-time sense the machining environment, analyze workpiece materials and shapes, predict machining challenges, and automatically optimize parameters.</li>
                <li><strong>Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)</strong> is another highlight of intelligent turning. By analyzing real-time equipment operation data, the system can predict potential failures and intervene in advance, avoiding unplanned downtime.</li>
                <li><strong>The introduction of digital twin technology</strong> further enhances the virtual simulation capabilities of intelligent turning. By constructing a model identical to the physical entity in the digital space, the digital twin can simulate the machining process and predict outcomes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Evolution of Turning Art: From Functional Manufacturing to Infinite Possibilities in Micro Art</h3>
            <p>Turning technology is no longer just a means of industrial manufacturing; it is also a tool for artistic creation. The rise of micro turning art has taken this traditional craft to an unprecedented level of precision, showcasing the deep integration of science and art.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The essence of micro turning art lies in applying turning technology to artistic creation at the micrometer or even nanometer scale.</strong> Through high-precision CNC turning technology, artists can create awe-inspiring works on the millimeter or even smaller scale.</li>
                <li><strong>Material innovation is a significant driver of micro turning art.</strong> In addition to traditional metals and wood, modern materials such as carbon fiber and resin-based composites are increasingly becoming mediums for artistic creation.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized customization is another major advantage of micro turning art.</strong> Artists can tailor unique works to meet specific client requirements.</li>
            </ul>
