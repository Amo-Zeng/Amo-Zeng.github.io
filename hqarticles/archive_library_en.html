            <p>Archives are not just recorders of history and guardians of cultural heritage; they are also a treasure trove for interdisciplinary research and a tool for predicting future developments. By integrating perspectives from historians, sociologists, psychologists, technology experts, and artists, we can fully understand the modern significance of archival collections and how they influence our present and future.</p>

            <h3>Historian's Perspective: A Mirror of Social Structure</h3>
            <p>Historian Li Ming notes that ancient documents in archives are invaluable resources for studying social structures. By analyzing China's ancient household registration system, we can not only observe population distribution and social strata but also understand how the ruling class managed society and the living conditions of the lower classes. Combining these ancient documents with contemporary sociologist Zhang Xiaomin's theories, we find that despite different eras, the basic principles of social stratification and mobility still exist. This deep continuity provides a valuable perspective for understanding modern society.</p>

Through the collective efforts of experts from various fields, we can not only extract valuable information from archives but also apply it to solve contemporary issues, predict, and shape future developments.
