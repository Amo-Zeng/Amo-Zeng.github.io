                <p>In the wave of contemporary artistic practice, music creation is undergoing a profound self-reconstruction. It is no longer merely the expression of a composer's personal emotions, nor just the pure pursuit of formal beauty, but is gradually revealing a more complex picture: a networked system woven together by technological logic, ecological relationships, and neuroscience. From algorithm generation from the perspective of the philosophy of technology, to environmental interaction in acoustic ecology, and to the inter-brain resonance revealed by neuroaesthetics, the essence of music creation is being redefined through the integration of these three dimensions. They are not separate from each other but form a continuous understanding framework—from the technological "input" of the external world, to the ecological interactive "processing," and then to the neural collective "output," together forming a complete closed loop of music creation as a systematic practice. Within this framework, music is no longer an isolated work but a dynamic event resulting from the joint action of technology, environment, and the body.</p>

                <h3>I. Philosophy of Technology: The Migration of Creative Subjectivity in the Algorithmic Age</h3>
                <p>Today, as artificial intelligence comprehensively permeates the field of art, the ontological foundation of music creation is undergoing a fundamental shake-up. Traditionally, music creation was seen as a projection of the composer's subjectivity, an objectification process of inspiration, skill, and emotion. However, when AI systems like AIVA or MusicLM can generate stylistically realistic music based on massive data, we are compelled to ask: who is the true subject of creation?</p>
                <p>This question points directly to the core proposition of the philosophy of technology. As Heidegger stated, modern technology is a "Gestell" (Enframing), which transforms the world into calculable and adjustable objects. In AI composition, music is enframed as data: melodies become vectors, harmonies turn into probability distributions, and emotions are quantified as labels. The composer's work is no longer creation from scratch but adjusting parameters, guiding models, and筛选筛选 results. The driving force of creation shifts from "the burst of inspiration" to "emergence within the system." Artist Holly Herndon's collaborative practice with her AI assistant Spawn exemplifies this "co-agency": Spawn is not a tool but a "non-human actor" within the creative network, forming a dynamic actor-network (ANT) with humans.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, AI music reshapes the concept of "Aura" proposed by Benjamin. An AI-generated "Chopin-style nocturne" is neither a copy nor an original, but a style simulation based on statistical规律. The aura of music no longer依附于 the author's uniqueness but exists in the generative process of human-computer interaction—when the user inputs instructions, the system navigates the latent space, ultimately emerging with unprecedented sounds. Therefore, the重心 of creation shifts from "creating works" to "exploring possibilities," and the composer transforms from an "author" to a "curator" and "guide." The subjectivity of music creation thus expands into a distributed system encompassing algorithms, data, users, and interfaces.</p>

                <h3>II. Acoustic Ecology: From Anthropocentric to Ecologically Symbiotic Auditory Practice</h3>
                <p>If the philosophy of technology reveals the "input" mechanism of music creation—how form is extracted from chaos—then acoustic ecology emphasizes the "processing" dimension: how music generates meaning through interaction with the environment. Traditional music concepts区分 sounds into "musical tones" and "noise," but acoustic ecology breaks this binary opposition, placing music within broader ecological relationships.</p>
                <p>R. Murray Schafer's "soundscape" theory is the starting point for this shift. Sound is no longer a passive object but a product of resonance between humans and the environment. Chris Watson, by recording natural sounds like polar ice cracking and polar bear breathing, transforms inaudible ecological dynamics into perceptible narratives; Bernie Krause reveals the structural nature of sound in ecosystems through "biophony," even using it as a diagnostic tool for ecological health. In these practices, music is no longer a human monologue but a cross-species dialogue.</p>
                <p>The urban environment同样 constitutes a complex acoustic ecology. Christina Kubisch "revisits" historically unrecorded sounds through electromagnetic induction, transforming material memory into auditory experience. This creative approach echoes Tim Ingold's "ecology of perception," emphasizing the "entanglement" of body and environment. Music thus becomes an intermediary interface, connecting human and non-human, past and present, nature and technology.</p>
                <p>From this perspective, the core question of music creation shifts from aesthetic control to ethical response. Donna Haraway's concept of "sympoiesis" is particularly crucial: we do not create music but co-generate it with nature, technology, and history. Music thereby becomes a practice of ecological ethics, reminding us that sound is a witness to relationships, and music is a collusion between the human and non-human worlds.</p>

                <h3>III. Neuroaesthetics: Music as a Biological Interface for Inter-Brain Resonance</h3>
                <p>Music ultimately reaches the听众, and neuroaesthetics reveals from the "output" end how music achieves emotional共鸣 through neural mechanisms. Research shows that music creation is essentially a "ritualized encoding of inter-brain resonance"—composers design acoustic structures to guide listeners' brains into a synchronous state, thereby achieving the sharing of collective emotions.</p>
                <p>The neural mechanisms of this process have been gradually revealed. Aniruddh Patel's "Shared Acoustic Feature Hypothesis" points out that music from different cultures shares certain acoustic features (such as periodic rhythm, tension changes), which can activate conserved neural pathways. Edward Large's "Dynamic Attractor Theory" further explains how rhythm acts as a neural oscillator, resonating with brainwave frequencies to form "entrainment." For example, Gregorian chant resonates with alpha waves to induce meditation, while African drumming activates motor networks through polyrhythms to prompt group dancing.</p>
                <p>Contemporary music also utilizes this mechanism. Max Richter's "On the Nature of Daylight" uses repetitive phrases and slow harmonies to construct a "neural attractor" that aligns with theta waves, guiding listeners into an introspective state. V.S. Ramachandran's "neuroaesthetic module" theory suggests that the brain has specific reaction modules for features like dissonance and major scales. Composers are essentially利用 these biological mechanisms to compile cultural symbols into neural signals.</p>
                <p>Therefore, music creation is not about expressing emotions but designing neural interfaces. It achieves brainwave synchronization across cultures, allowing individuals to transcend differences in shared rhythms and form collective consciousness. Music becomes an "inter-brain ritual," connecting countless brains into a resonant network.</p>

            <section class="article-conclusion">
                <h3>Conclusion: The Deep Essence of Music as an Interwoven System</h3>
                <p>The philosophy of technology, acoustic ecology, and neuroaesthetics reconstruct the essence of music creation from three aspects: machine subjectivity, environmental interaction, and inter-brain resonance, respectively. They共同 point to a core proposition: music creation is a complex system interwoven with technology, ecology, and neural mechanisms.</p>
                <p>In this system, AI algorithms enframe the world as calculable data input, acoustic ecology processes creation as a symbiotic interaction between humans and the environment, and neural mechanisms output music as a collective ritual of inter-brain共鸣. The three form a complete chain from external to internal, from technology to body, from individual to collective. Music is no longer a passive work but an active event; no longer a closed product but an open process.</p>
                <p>Future music creation will require us to超越 traditional aesthetic frameworks and enter a kind of cross-disciplinary, cross-species, cross-consciousness systems thinking. We may no longer ask "Who is the author of this piece?" but rather "How was this music generated within the network of technology, environment, and brains?"—this is not only a重新理解 of the essence of music but also a重新审视 of our relationship with the world and ourselves. Music ultimately becomes a witness to our symbiosis with technology, coexistence with ecology, and resonance with others.</p>
