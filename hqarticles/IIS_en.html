        <section>
            <h3>4.2.1 Infrastructure Security Hardening</h3>
            <p>The security of the infrastructure is the cornerstone of the entire IIS security system. Regularly update the Windows operating system to ensure all known vulnerabilities are fixed. Assign the minimum necessary permissions to IIS services and related processes, and isolate the IIS server from other non-critical business systems through Virtual LAN (VLAN) and firewall rules to reduce the attack surface.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>4.2.2 IIS Configuration Security Optimization</h3>
            <p>The configuration of IIS directly affects its security. Disable unnecessary IIS feature modules, such as WebDAV and ASP, which are seldom used, to reduce potential attack points. Restrict access to the IIS server through IP address restrictions, SSL/TLS enforcement, and authentication mechanisms. Enable detailed logging functionality to monitor all access requests and error logs, and promptly identify abnormal behavior.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>4.2.3 Web Application Security Protection</h3>
            <p>Web applications running on IIS are the most common attack vectors for attackers. Strictly validate and filter user input to prevent attacks such as SQL injection and XSS. Encode output data to avoid the execution of malicious scripts. Implement secure session management mechanisms to avoid session hijacking and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block common web application attacks.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>4.2.4 Data Security and Encryption</h3>
            <p>Encrypt sensitive data for storage and transmission to ensure that even in the event of a data breach, attackers cannot easily read the data. Establish a comprehensive data backup mechanism and regularly conduct recovery tests to ensure rapid business recovery in the event of an attack or data corruption.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>4.2.5 Security Monitoring and Response</h3>
            <p>Establish a dynamic security monitoring and response mechanism to quickly detect and respond to potential threats. Deploy a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to monitor the security status of IIS servers in real time and identify abnormal behavior promptly. Establish an automated response mechanism to take protective measures automatically upon detecting an attack, such as isolating infected systems and blocking malicious traffic. Develop a detailed incident response plan to ensure a swift and effective response to security incidents.</p>

            <h3>V. Future Prospects: IIS's Role in the Cloud-Native Era</h3>
            <p>Despite the challenges, IIS's transformation path is not without hope. Microsoft, as an active participant in the cloud-native field, has recognized the limitations of IIS in modern cloud environments and is taking steps to drive its development towards cloud-native. Future IIS may become more modular, allowing developers to load specific functional modules as needed, reducing unnecessary resource consumption and making it more suitable for containerized environments. Additionally, Microsoft is pushing for further support for Windows containers in Kubernetes, and future IIS may be more tightly integrated with the Kubernetes ecosystem, for example, by simplifying IIS management and scaling in Kubernetes through the Operator pattern.</p>
            <p>Seamless integration with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is also an important direction. As Microsoft's cloud service platform, AKS provides good support for Windows containers. In the future, IIS may work better with AKS, providing enterprises with a smooth migration path from on-premises to the cloud.</p>

            <h3>VI. Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In the cloud-native era, IIS's transformation is not only a technical challenge but also a change in corporate culture and organizational structure. Through containerized migration, migration to .NET Core, or adopting a hybrid architecture, enterprises can gradually push forward IIS's cloud-native transformation. Performance optimization and security hardening are key to ensuring the stable operation of IIS in cloud-native environments. In the future, with Microsoft's strong investment in cloud-native technologies, IIS is expected to find a new role in this wave, becoming an important part of enterprises in multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments. Embracing cloud-native is not just a technical choice but also a strategic deployment for enterprises looking to the future.</p>
