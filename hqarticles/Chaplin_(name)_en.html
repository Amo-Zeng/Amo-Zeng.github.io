            <h2>Analysis of API Error Situation</h2>
            <p>During the data interaction with the upstream API, we received an error message: <strong>Max free usage reached</strong>. This means our free usage limit has been reached, and the API request was therefore denied.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Possible Causes of the Problem</h3>
            <p>The following are potential causes of this issue and their explanations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Free Usage Limit:</strong> Most third-party service providers set a free usage limit to prevent excessive resource consumption.</li>
                <li><strong>High Request Frequency:</strong> Due to a high call frequency, we may have reached the usage limit in a short period.</li>
                <li><strong>Account Configuration Issues:</strong> The package configured in the account may not fit the current usage situation.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Solutions and Recommendations</h3>
            <p>To restore normal API usage, we can consider the following strategies:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Upgrade Service Plan:</strong> Review the available plans from the service provider and choose one that fits the current usage needs to increase the limit.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimize API Calls:</strong> Optimize the frequency of API calls in the code to reduce unnecessary requests.</li>
                <li><strong>Contact Technical Support:</strong> If the issue persists, it is recommended to contact the API providerâ€™s technical support for further assistance and guidance.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h3>Long-term Data Management Strategy</h3>
            <p>To prevent similar issues from happening again, we need to establish a comprehensive data management and monitoring mechanism:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regularly check usage statistics to stay informed about usage status.</li>
                <li>Develop reasonable request strategies and traffic control mechanisms to maximize usage efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
