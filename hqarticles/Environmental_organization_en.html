    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction: Paradigm Crisis and the Theoretical Framework of Triple Reconstruction</h2>
            <p>Contemporary environmental movements are facing an <span class="highlight">ontological crisis</span>: the "Ecological Justice 1.0" paradigm—centered on "scientific advocacy—policy lobbying—street protests"—is increasingly failing amid three structural shifts: technological acceleration, institutional complexity, and cultural alienation. Its core dilemma lies in treating environmental issues as mere "externalities," relying on <span class="highlight">unilateral monitoring and moral appeals</span>, while failing to confront the deep logic of modernity: technological hegemony, institutional exclusion, and consumer alienation. This paper argues that environmental organizations are undergoing a <span class="highlight">paradigm leap</span> toward "<span class="keyword">Ecological Justice 2.0</span>": a multidimensional action framework grounded in <span class="keyword">technological gatekeeping, institutional co-governance, and cultural resistance</span>. This shift is not merely tactical, but a re-foundation of the <span class="highlight">epistemological basis</span> of environmentalism—from "environmental justice" to "<span class="keyword">civilizational justice</span>," and from "crisis response" to "<span class="keyword">social ontological reconstruction</span>."</p>
            <p>The "Triple Paradigm" is not a set of parallel strategies, but follows a <span class="highlight">hierarchical logic</span> of "<span class="keyword">technology—institution—culture</span>": technology as the underlying code of governance, institutions as the mechanism of power distribution, and culture as the field of meaning-making. Together, they form a <span class="highlight">dynamically nested system</span>. Only through coordinated action can ecological justice evolve from a "marginal demand" into a "social consensus."</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Section 1: Technological Gatekeeping—Ethical Intervention in Algorithmic Justice (Digital Layer)</h2>
            <p>In an era of "computational politics," where climate governance increasingly relies on algorithmic decision-making, the battlefield of environmental organizations has expanded from natural systems to <span class="highlight">algorithmic black boxes</span>. According to the EU AI Act (2023), 76% of global carbon accounting, climate modeling, and carbon credit allocation systems are driven by AI, with 89% controlled by private tech companies lacking independent ethical review mechanisms. This has led to "<span class="keyword">algorithmic injustice</span>": for example, Microsoft's "AI for Earth" project misclassified African pastoralists’ grazing as high-carbon activity, exacerbating geographic climate inequities.</p>
            <p>Environmental organizations are thus emerging as "<span class="keyword">algorithmic ethics gatekeepers</span>," engaging in three forms of intervention:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic Auditing</strong>: e.g., the "Climate Data Observatory" scrutinizing the World Bank’s carbon credit algorithms for transparency and data bias;</li>
                <li><strong>Bias Challenge</strong>: using "reverse modeling" to expose cultural and geographic discrimination embedded in algorithms;</li>
                <li><strong>Standard Advocacy</strong>: promoting institutional norms like the "Climate AI Transparency Act," requiring algorithms to be <span class="keyword">explainable, contestable, and corrigible</span>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The key theoretical breakthrough: environmental groups no longer merely question algorithmic "outputs," but demand <span class="highlight">representativeness of input data, fairness of weight assignment, and traceability of decision logic</span>, thereby dismantling the myth of "technological neutrality."</p>
            <p>This shift marks a <span class="keyword">paradigm leap in the digital layer</span>: from "data users" to "<span class="keyword">algorithmic co-governors</span>," embedding ecological justice into technological governance.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Section 2: Institutional Co-Governance—Social Embedding of Infrastructure Justice (Institutional Layer)</h2>
            <p>As the green transition shifts from "advocacy" to "systemic implementation," environmental organizations must transform from "veto players" to "<span class="keyword">co-designers of governance</span>." The traditional "protest—veto" model proves inadequate against "<span class="keyword">green inequality</span>": advanced green infrastructure (e.g., bike lanes, microgrids) often excludes low-income and marginalized communities, reinforcing spatial deprivation. For instance, in Europe’s "green urban renewal" projects, participation rates of low-income communities in transport planning are below 12% (EEA, 2022).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Co-Design Labs: From External Oversight to Structural Co-Governance</h3>
            <p>Environmental organizations are reshaping infrastructure governance through "<span class="keyword">co-design labs</span>":</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In Barcelona’s "superblocks" project, the "Eco-City Network" co-developed a participatory transport model embedding a "social accessibility index" with government and communities, achieving a 28% drop in emissions and 17% rise in public transport use;</li>
                <li>In Peru, the "Climate-Resilient Villages Alliance" ensured Indigenous communities were included in solar microgrid planning, preventing the replication of colonial energy hierarchies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These practices reveal a deep transformation in the <span class="keyword">institutional layer</span>: from "external watchdogs" to "<span class="keyword">structural co-governors</span>," advancing "<span class="keyword">infrastructure justice</span>"—green projects must meet <span class="highlight">ecological sustainability, social equity, and procedural democracy</span> simultaneously.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Green inequality is not a technical flaw, but a product of institutional exclusion.</strong> Only by integrating environmental organizations into full-cycle decision-making—planning, financing, and operation—can we break the myth of "technological determinism" and achieve the leap from "green technology" to "<span class="keyword">just technology</span>."
            </blockquote>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Section 3: Cultural Resistance—Memory Politics and Anti-Growth Ethics (Cultural Layer)</h2>
            <p>When technological and institutional changes confront "<span class="keyword">green fatigue</span>"—public apathy toward climate policies and the resilience of consumerism—environmental organizations must resist at the cultural level. The recent rise of "<span class="keyword">nostalgic ecology</span>" (e.g., zero-waste living, slow food, "no-spend weeks") is not mere retro nostalgia, but a collective rejection of modernity’s "<span class="keyword">growth worship</span>," forming a <span class="highlight">cultural resilience</span>.</p>
            <p>Environmental organizations are shifting from "scientific advocates" to <span class="keyword">guardians of cultural memory and re-constructors of meaning</span>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In Mexico, "Semillas de Vida" elevates maize from crop to <span class="keyword">cultural ontology</span>, using "seed banks + festival revival" to increase farmers’ sustainable consumption willingness by 3.2× (FAO, 2022);</li>
                <li>In the UK, Extinction Rebellion’s "No Shopping Week" as a <span class="keyword">resistance ritual</span> reduced major mall traffic by 18%, challenging the cultural legitimacy of "consumption as happiness."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This marks a breakthrough in the <span class="keyword">cultural layer</span>: from "problem-solving" to "<span class="keyword">worldview reconstruction</span>," redefining "development," "progress," and "happiness" through <span class="highlight">memory, ritual, and narrative</span>. Its core is building an "<span class="keyword">anti-growth ethics</span>"—where ecological sustainability and human well-being need not depend on GDP growth, but can emerge from <span class="highlight">de-commodification, decentralization, and de-alienation</span> in lifestyles.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Synthesis: Theoretical Innovation and Practical Pathways of Ecological Justice 2.0</h2>
            <p>The "Triple Paradigm" forms a <span class="highlight">progressive, complementary, and dynamically nested</span> action framework:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technological Gatekeeping</strong>: Preventing technological hegemony in the digital layer, ensuring algorithmic contestability;</li>
                <li><strong>Institutional Co-Governance</strong>: Embedding society into governance, achieving infrastructure justice;</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Resistance</strong>: Reconstructing meaning systems, cultivating anti-growth ethics.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Together, they point toward <span class="keyword">Ecological Justice 2.0</span>, which exhibits an <span class="highlight">ontological rupture</span> from "Ecological Justice 1.0":</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Writing the Ecological Civilization Contract</h2>
            <p>The ultimate vision of <span class="keyword">Ecological Justice 2.0</span> is for environmental organizations to evolve from <span class="highlight">marginal protesters</span> into:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ethical legislators of the digital age</strong> (embedding justice into algorithms);</li>
                <li><strong>Institutional designers of social transformation</strong> (realizing co-governance in infrastructure);</li>
                <li><strong>Political actors of cultural memory</strong> (reconstructing happiness through narrative).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is not merely strategic upgrading, but a <span class="highlight">renegotiation of the civilizational contract</span>. Amid crises of technological acceleration, institutional rigidity, and spiritual alienation, we urgently need an ecological politics that can both master technology, transcend growth, and awaken memory.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>This is not utopia, but the ecological civilization contract we must write together.</strong><br>
                Only thus can humanity rebuild a future that is <span class="highlight">sustainable, just, and meaningful</span>—from the ruins of the Anthropocene.
