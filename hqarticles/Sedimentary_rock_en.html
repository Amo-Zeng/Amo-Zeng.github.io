        <h2>Sedimentary Rocks: The Earth's Memory, Civilizational Archives, and the Slow Time of the Carbon Cycle</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
        <article>
            <p>In the Grand Canyon of Arizona, geologists have discovered disturbing inclusions within an exposed layer of sedimentary rock: 20th-century plastic fragments are weathering alongside billion-year-old sandstone. This scene is like an accidental crack in a time capsule—where ancient Earth memories converge with modern human waste, revealing sedimentary rocks' triple identity as <strong>carriers of Earth's memory, media of civilizational archives, and regulators of the carbon cycle</strong>. We stand at a cognitive turning point: sedimentary rocks are no longer passive geological phenomena, but active interfaces entangling Earth's fate with humanity's. They are the "hard drives" of geological time, the "engraving tools" of civilization's traces, and the "valves" of carbon destiny. In the accelerating Anthropocene, sedimentary rocks silently remind us: we are co-writing an irreversible sedimentary history with the Earth itself.</p>

            <h2>I. The Distortion of Geological Memory: When Sedimentary Rocks Become Selective Archivists</h2>
            <p>The formation of sedimentary rocks is essentially the Earth's process of "encoding" past events. However, this process is not a holographic recording but is constrained by an uneven sedimentation rate, erosion hiatuses, and diagenetic alteration—a "triple compression algorithm." In the Grand Canyon, there are depositional gaps (hiatuses) spanning hundreds of millions of years. These "gaps" are not missing information but instead convey critical information through their "silence" itself—like a "skipped frame" in geological memory, long misinterpreted as "no events" (<span class="reference">Boggs, 2006, <em>Petrology of Sedimentary Rocks</em></span>). This selective preservation makes stratigraphic layers a "fragmented hard drive," not a complete time scroll.</p>

            <p>A deeper issue lies in diagenesis, which distorts memory. Processes such as compaction, cementation, and mineral recrystallization blur original sedimentary structures, deform fossils, and even erase them entirely. Thus, stratigraphic layers are not "objective historical records" but a series of "time capsules" that have been compressed, deleted, and re-encoded. The French historian Pierre Nora's theory of "sites of memory" (<span class="reference">Nora, 1989, <em>Les Lieux de Mémoire</em></span>) aptly parallels geological strata: each set of strata is imbued with narrative functions—the Cambrian strata symbolizing the "explosion of life," the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary marking the "extinction of dinosaurs." These labels are not inherent to the strata themselves but are "implanted" by geologists during interpretation.</p>

            <blockquote>
                The record of the "Cambrian Explosion" may be overestimated because rising global sea levels at that time first created vast shallow marine deposits capable of fossil preservation (<span class="reference">Schulte et al., 2010, <em>Science</em></span>). What we see as an "explosion" is actually the opening of a sedimentary window—a selective preservation of geological memory.
            </blockquote>

            <p>This "selectivity" stems not only from physical processes but also from human interpretation. We will never obtain a "complete past of the Earth," just as we cannot recover an original video from a fragmented hard drive. The "memory" of sedimentary rocks is a product jointly constructed by geological processes and human cognition.</p>

            <h2>II. The Geologicalization of Civilization: When Humans Become the Authors of Their Own Sedimentary Layers</h2>
            <p>In stark contrast to the slow formation of geological memory, human civilization is now creating new "cultural sedimentary layers" at an astonishing pace. In Venice, after tides recede, they leave behind not only silt but also plastic bottles, face masks, and corroded electronic devices. These anthropogenic materials are mixing with natural sediments at rates of centimeters per year, forming a new type of "civilization layer" (<span class="reference">Zalasiewicz et al., 2018, <em>The Anthropocene as a Geological Time Unit</em></span>). We are no longer mere witnesses to history but <strong>active authors</strong> of sedimentary strata.</p>

            <p>Concrete, the cornerstone of modern civilization, is consumed globally at about 30 billion tons annually (<span class="reference">Mehta & Monteiro, 2014, <em>Concrete: Microstructure, Properties, and Materials</em></span>). Its fragments accumulate in abandoned cities, mix with weathered products, and form "concrete rocks." This artificial rock has a mineral composition vastly different from natural sedimentary rocks but may become a key marker for future geologists identifying the "Anthropocene." Even more unsettling is plastic—around 4 million tons of plastic are deposited annually on global coastlines (<span class="reference">Jambeck et al., 2015, <em>Science</em></span>). These plastics fragment under UV radiation and mechanical action, eventually binding with sediment to form "plastiglomerate" (<span class="reference">Corcoran et al., 2014, <em>GSA Today</em></span>).</p>

            <blockquote>
                Archaeological stratigraphy teaches us that ancient civilizations are often preserved as "accumulation layers." Troy's nine layers of settlement (<span class="reference">Schliemann, 1880, <em>Troy and Its Remains</em></span>) represent cycles of destruction and rebuilding. But the "accumulation layers" of the Anthropocene are forming in far more complex ways—we are not merely leaving behind ruins, but altering global sedimentation patterns through industrial activity.
            </blockquote>

            <p>We are now <strong>actively designing our own geological legacy</strong>—yet have no control over how it will ultimately be interpreted. We may become "fossils" for future civilizations, but our "fossils" will not be bones, but plastic, concrete, and nuclear waste. This is a form of civilizational <strong>self-burial</strong>.</p>

            <h2>III. The Slow Valve of the Carbon Cycle: When Geological Time Meets Human Time</h2>
            <p>In Norway's fjords, silicate rocks are weathering at about 0.01 millimeters per year (<span class="reference">Dessert et al., 2003, <em>Nature</em></span>). This seemingly insignificant process is one of the most critical "slow valves" in Earth's carbon cycle—every ton of weathered silicate rock absorbs approximately 0.3 tons of atmospheric CO₂. Yet humanity emits 40 billion tons of CO₂ annually (<span class="reference">IPCC, 2021</span>), overwhelming this valve at a pace geological time cannot perceive. We face not only a carbon emission problem but a <strong>fundamental mismatch of time scales</strong>: sedimentary carbon regulation operates on millennial timescales, while human emissions unfold in decades.</p>

            <p>The carbonate compensation depth (CCD) effect further complicates the issue. As atmospheric CO₂ rises, ocean acidification causes the depth of carbonate dissolution to rise, releasing more carbon. This negative feedback takes millennia to balance, while human-emitted CO₂ remains in the atmosphere for only centuries. Thus, sedimentary rock carbon regulation becomes a "lagging system"—always responding to past changes, not present crises.</p>

            <blockquote>
                A deeper issue is the ethical dilemma of "deep time governance." When we inject CO₂ underground for storage (e.g., Norway's Sleipner project), we are effectively transferring carbon management responsibility to future geological processes. But the stability of sedimentary rocks is not eternal—earthquakes, volcanic activity, or tectonic uplift could cause stored carbon to leak. Do we have the right to impose millennial-scale geological risks on future generations? This "temporal colonialism" is becoming a central issue in climate ethics.
            </blockquote>

            <p>Sedimentary rocks, as the "slow valves" of carbon, remind us: climate governance must shift from "short-term responses" to "deep-time responsibility."</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Learning to Coexist with Geological Time</h2>
            <p>The three identities of sedimentary rocks—memory carrier, civilizational archive, carbon regulator—point to a central proposition: <strong>our fundamental misalignment with geological time</strong>. We attempt to use geological processes to understand the past, record the present, and manage the future, yet find ourselves incapable of truly grasping the rhythm of geological time. Sedimentary rocks remind us: true wisdom lies not in conquering time, but in learning to coexist with it.</p>

            <p>This demands that we redesign civilization's material metabolism, integrating "degradability" and "geological responsibility" into technological ethics; that we develop frameworks for "deep time governance," extending carbon management responsibilities to centennial scales; and, above all, that we acknowledge: Earth's memory, like our own, is incomplete—yet it is precisely this incompleteness that keeps us humble. As Bruno Latour (<span class="reference">Latour, 2017, <em>Facing Gaia</em></span>) wrote: "We are not the Earth's stewards, but its interlocutors." Sedimentary rocks are the medium of this dialogue. They allow us, in slow time, to rethink the possibilities of memory, responsibility, and coexistence.</p>
