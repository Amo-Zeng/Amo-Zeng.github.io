            <h2>The Fading Boundaries of Nature: A Narrative from Microcosm to Wilderness</h2>
            <p>On this planet increasingly dominated by human activities, the boundaries between nature and civilization are quietly fading, in a subtle yet profound way. This change is not only evident in the macroscopic retreat of glaciers and the disappearance of forests, but also hidden deep within the soil, and even traceable in the barren deserts.</p>

            <h3>Microscopic Perspective: Ecological Migration in the Soil</h3>
            <p>Beneath our feet lies a complex and intricate microcosm hidden within the soil. Billions of microorganisms thrive here, forming an essential yet often overlooked ecosystem. However, with environmental pollution, climate change, and altered land use, microbial communities are undergoing unprecedented migration and restructuring.</p>

            <h3>The Veiled Realm: The Blurring Boundaries Between Humans and Nature</h3>
            <p>In the foggy mornings of the Yellow Mountains, I found the perfect stage for the fading boundaries between humans and nature. The boundaries of mountains and sky become ambiguous, and human文明的markers like electricity towers blend seamlessly with the natural landscape.</p>

            <h3>The Voice of the Wild: Time Travelers in the Desert</h3>
            <p>The desert, seemingly barren, is one of the oldest ecosystems on Earth. Here, I focus my lens on those who have evolved alongside the desert: resilient desert plants, agile lizards, drought-resistant beetles, and ancient city ruins barely visible in the sand.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Preserving Nature, Respecting Life</h3>
            <p>From the microscopic world in the soil to the fading boundaries in the misty mountains, and to the time travelers in the barren desert, I attempt to reveal the ever-changing boundaries between humans and nature through my lens. These works are not only a tribute to nature but also a warning about human activities.</p>
