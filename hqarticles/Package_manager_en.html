                <h1><strong>Package Manager: From Tool to Organizer of Techno-Social Relations</strong></h1>
                <p><strong>Introduction: An Overlooked Revolution in Techno-Social Order</strong></p>
                <p>In the daily life of the digital age, we execute millions of commands like <code>npm install</code>, <code>pip install</code>, and <code>cargo add</code>—seemingly simple operations that have long transcended their instrumental role as "code downloaders," quietly becoming <strong>core nodes that restructure techno-social relations</strong>.</p>
                <p>The package manager—once an obscure background utility—is now triggering a <strong>triple revolution</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ontological Revolution</strong>: It redefines the boundaries of "software existence," transforming software from "static files" into "dynamic networks of relationships";</li>
                    <li><strong>Governance Revolution</strong>: It emerges as de facto governance infrastructure in open-source ecosystems, shaping a "technocratic governance" model;</li>
                    <li><strong>Cognitive Revolution</strong>: It induces "dependency addiction," alienating developers from "creators" into "dependency orchestrators".</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Together, these revolutions point to a core proposition: <strong>package managers are no longer tools—they are organizers of techno-social relations</strong>. Through dependency resolution, namespace control, and one-click imports, they reshape the deep structures of *how software exists*, *how power is distributed*, and *how developers think*.</p>
                <p>This article adopts a three-dimensional framework of "<strong>Technology-Society-People</strong>" to reveal how, beneath the surface of convenience, package managers construct an <strong>invisible yet highly centralized techno-social order</strong>. We will see how a simple <code>import</code> command carries multiple layers of ontological, governance, and cognitive sovereignty struggles; how the ideal of "open sharing" is being distorted by "dependency bubbles," "soft authority," and "cognitive outsourcing".</p>
                <p>This is not merely a change in software engineering—it is a <strong>deep restructuring of techno-social relations in the digital age</strong>.</p>

                <h2><strong>Chapter 1: Ontological Revolution — How Do Package Managers Redefine the Boundaries of 'Software Existence'?</strong></h2>
                <blockquote class="philosophy">
                    <strong>Core Thesis</strong>: Package managers redefine software from "static entities" to "dynamic relational entities" through mechanisms like dependency resolution, version locking, and virtual environments—ushering in a new ontological paradigm: <em>software as process</em>.
                </blockquote>

                <h3>1.1 The Twilight of the Traditional Paradigm: Program as File</h3>
                <p>Under the "program as file" paradigm, software is characterized by <strong>embodiment</strong>, <strong>closure</strong>, <strong>atomicity</strong>, and <strong>identifiability</strong>. However, with the rise of <strong>distributed, collaborative, cloud-native</strong> software, this paradigm faces systemic crises:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dependency explosion</strong>: A front-end project may depend on thousands of npm packages;</li>
                    <li><strong>Version conflicts</strong>: Incompatible versions of the same library cannot coexist;</li>
                    <li><strong>Environment drift</strong>: Differences in development environments lead to "it works on my machine";</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-reproducibility</strong>: Without version locking, builds are not repeatable.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="philosophy"><strong>Philosophical Impact</strong>: <strong>Files can no longer contain the full existence of software</strong>. The true existence of software increasingly depends on its <strong>dynamic network of relationships with external packages</strong>, not its own content.</p>

                <h3>1.2 Ontological Reconstruction by Package Managers: From Entity to Relationship</h3>
                <h4>(1) Dependency Resolution: Software as an "Existence Graph"</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>npm's <code>package-lock.json</code> precisely records the dependency tree;</li>
                    <li>Cargo's <code>Cargo.lock</code> locks all dependency hashes;</li>
                    <li>pip's <code>poetry</code> provides deterministic resolution.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="philosophy"><strong>Philosophical Implication</strong>: Software's existence is <strong>graph-based</strong>—its "presence" depends on the versions, compatibility, licenses, and security status of all nodes in the graph. This challenges the traditional "entity ontology," shifting toward <strong>relational ontology</strong>.</p>

                <h4>(2) Version Locking & Semantic Versioning: The "Temporality" of Existence</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>SemVer encodes version changes as <strong>existential transformations</strong>:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Major version: existential rupture;</li>
                            <li>Minor version: existential expansion;</li>
                            <li>Patch version: existential repair.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><code>lockfile</code> "freezes" software at a specific moment, giving its existence <strong>reproducible historicity</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="philosophy">This echoes Heidegger's concept of "<strong>the temporality of Dasein</strong>"—software exists <strong>in time</strong>, its "presence" dependent on memory of past versions and anticipation of future changes.</p>

                <h4>(3) Virtual Environments: Decentralization & Contextualization of Existence</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Virtual environments (<code>venv</code>, <code>node_modules</code>, Docker) isolate software from the global system;</li>
                    <li>Multiple versions of the same dependency can coexist in different environments;</li>
                    <li>Containerization realizes "environment as software," giving software existence <strong>ephemerality</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="philosophy"><strong>Philosophical Implication</strong>: Software no longer "belongs" to a machine, but to a <strong>context</strong>. Its existence is <strong>local</strong> and <strong>temporary</strong>, resonating with Deleuze's philosophy of "<strong>becoming</strong>" (devenir)—software as <strong>generative being</strong>.</p>

                <h3>1.3 Case Studies: Collapse and Reconstruction of Existence Networks</h3>
                <div class="case">
                    <strong>Case: npm and the "left-pad" Incident</strong><br>
                    In 2016, <code>left-pad</code> was unpublished, crashing thousands of projects. This exposed the <strong>parasitic nature</strong> of software existence—its survival depends on others' ongoing maintenance.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ontological Shock</strong>: Software existence relies on a <strong>fragile network</strong>;</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution</strong>: npm introduced <code>lockfile</code> to "freeze" the dependency graph, restoring stability;</li>
                        <li><strong>Insight</strong>: Modern software is <strong>networked existence</strong>, whose stability depends on <strong>redundancy and backup of the dependency graph</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="case">
                    <strong>Case: The "Ephemerality" of Docker Images</strong><br>
                    Docker images dynamically install dependencies at build time and are destroyed after runtime. Software existence is <strong>processual</strong>—it "exists" only in the moment of build and deployment.
                    <p class="philosophy"><strong>Ontological Insight</strong>: Software existence moves toward <strong>generative being</strong>, echoing Deleuze's "<strong>difference and repetition</strong>"—each deployment is a new act of becoming.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>1.4 Philosophical Reflection: Copyright, Reproducibility, and Digital Heritage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blurring of Copyright</strong>: Software consists of hundreds of dependencies. How do we define "originality"? Automated license tracking (e.g., FOSSA) attempts to trace, but the ontological shift to "software as relational network" challenges legal frameworks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Philosophical Value of Reproducibility</strong>: Package managers enable reproducible builds via <code>lockfile</code> and <code>containers</>. This is not just an engineering need, but a core principle of <strong>scientific philosophy</strong>: software experiments must be repeatable. In the future, <strong>reproducibility</strong> may become a necessary condition for software "existence".</li>
                    <li><strong>Preservation of Digital Heritage</strong>: Traditional preservation relies on "files", but modern software depends on dynamic networks. <strong>New paradigm</strong>: software heritage should be preserved as a "<strong>buildable dependency graph</strong>", not a static file.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="philosophy"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Package managers are triggering an <strong>ontological revolution in software</strong>. They compel us to accept a new ontological framework:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Software is a network of relationships</strong>;</li>
                        <li><strong>Software is a temporal process</strong>;</li>
                        <li><strong>Software is a contextualized entity</strong>;</li>
                        <li><strong>Software is a generative being</strong>.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p class="transition">When software's existence is redefined as a "relational network," who controls these relationships? Who decides which packages can exist, and which are removed? This naturally leads to the next dimension—<strong>governance</strong>.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2><strong>Chapter 2: Governance Revolution — Package Managers as Implicit Governance Infrastructure of the "Open Commons"</strong></h2>
                <blockquote class="philosophy">
                    <strong>Core Thesis</strong>: Through namespace control, mirroring strategies, security audits, and deprecation policies, package managers become de facto governance infrastructure in open-source ecosystems, shaping a "soft authority" model that challenges the democratizing vision of open source.
                </blockquote>

                <h3>2.1 Limitations of Traditional Governance: When "Consensus" Meets "Dependency Networks"</h3>
                <p>Traditional open-source governance relies on community consensus, foundations, and licenses, but fails in large-scale, decentralized, complex dependency ecosystems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Decision delays</strong>: Community discussions take too long;</li>
                    <li><strong>Enforcement weakness</strong>: Lack of automation;</li>
                    <li><strong>Uncontrolled dependency networks</strong>: A single malicious package can pollute the entire ecosystem (e.g., <code>event-stream</code> incident).</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="philosophy"><strong>Key Contradiction</strong>: The scale and complexity of open-source ecosystems now exceed the capacity of traditional governance.</p>

                <h3>2.2 "Technocratic Governance" by Package Managers: From Tool to Power Machine</h3>
                <h4>(1) Namespace Control: Access as Power</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>npm's <code>scopes</code> allow organizations to control namespaces, creating <strong>monopolies of naming rights</strong>;</li>
                    <li>PyPI's "project ownership" allows transfer, forming <strong>organizational hegemony</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="philosophy"><strong>Governance Implication</strong>: Access rights determine who can "speak" in the ecosystem, and who must "stay on the margins".</p>

                <h4>(2) Mirroring Strategies & CDN Control: Distribution as Power</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>PyPI's CDN and private mirrors create <strong>distribution monopolies</strong>;</li>
                    <li>Chinese mirrors may alter package contents, creating "<strong>mirror hegemony</strong>".</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="philosophy"><strong>Governance Implication</strong>: Mirroring determines <strong>who can access code</strong>, forming geographic power structures.</p>

                <h4>(3) Security Policies: Censorship as Power</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>npm's <code>audit</code> can automatically unpublish packages without community vote;</li>
                    <li>crates.io integrates <code>cargo-audit</code>, blocking vulnerable packages from being published.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="philosophy"><strong>Governance Implication</strong>: These mechanisms are essentially <strong>censorship without legislative process</strong>, forming "<strong>soft authority</strong>".</p>

                <h4>(4) Deprecation Policies: Control of Memory as Power</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>deprecate</code>, <code>tombstone</code> determine which packages are "allowed to exist" and which are "forgotten".</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="philosophy"><strong>Governance Implication</strong>: Deprecation is a form of <strong>memory control</strong>.</p>

                <h3>2.3 Case Studies: Shaping the Topology of Power</h3>
                <div class="case">
                    <strong>Case: npm's <code>scopes</code> and Organizational Hegemony</strong><br>
                    After npm introduced <code>scopes</code>, large organizations monopolized premium namespaces, making it difficult for small projects to compete, forming "<strong>organizational hegemony</strong>".
                    <p><strong>Result</strong>: Power no longer belongs to the community, but to organizations.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="case">
                    <strong>Case: PyPI's Mirrors and "Mirror Hegemony"</strong><br>
                    Chinese mirrors improve access speed, but can insert ads or backdoors, creating a paradox of "<strong>centralization within decentralization</strong>".
                    <p><strong>Paradox</strong>: <strong>Decentralization does not equal democratization</strong>.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>2.4 Governance Reflection: Soft Authority and the Tragedy of the Commons</h3>
                <h4>(1) The Rise of Soft Authority</h4>
                <p>Package managers' governance power is "<strong>soft</strong>": it is acquired through <strong>default configurations</strong>, <strong>user habits</strong>, and <strong>technical necessity</strong>, forming a "<strong>technical contract</strong>"—users unknowingly cede governance rights.</p>

                <h4>(2) From "Tragedy of the Commons" to "Black Box of the Package Manager"</h4>
                <p>The traditional "tragedy of the commons" refers to overuse of shared resources. But in the era of package managers, the tragedy has evolved into:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Access Tragedy</strong>: Unable to publish packages, losing voice;</li>
                    <li><strong>Censorship Tragedy</strong>: Automatically unpublished without appeal;</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory Tragedy</strong>: Marked as "deprecated," forgotten by the community.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="philosophy"><strong>Essence</strong>: The "commons" of open-source ecosystems are being replaced by the "<strong>black box of the package manager</strong>"—a more hidden, more efficient governance machine.</p>

                <p class="transition">When governance power is captured by package managers, developers' <strong>behavior patterns</strong> are inevitably reshaped. They are no longer passive "users," but participants guided by the system. This leads to the third dimension—<strong>cognitive labor</strong>.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2><strong>Chapter 3: Cognitive Revolution — How Do Package Managers Induce 'Dependency Addiction' and Reshape Developer Subjectivity?</strong></h2>
                <blockquote class="philosophy">
                    <strong>Core Thesis</strong>: Through "one-click imports," "dependency visibility," and "near-zero cost," package managers induce "dependency addiction," transforming developers from "creators" into "dependency orchestrators," leading to degradation of foundational skills, contraction of creativity boundaries, and alienation of technical judgment.
                </blockquote>

                <h3>3.1 Traditional Cognitive Labor: Embodied Creation and Implementation</h3>
                <p>Before the rise of package managers, developers followed a "<strong>creation-implementation</strong>" model, with cognitive labor characterized by <strong>deep cognitive engagement</strong>, <strong>dominance of foundational skills</strong>, and <strong>broad creativity boundaries</strong>.</p>
                <p class="philosophy"><strong>Philosophical Implication</strong>: Developers embody <strong>technological subjectivity</strong>.</p>

                <h3>3.2 Cognitive Outsourcing Mechanisms of Package Managers</h3>
                <h4>(1) One-Click Import: Near-Zero Cognitive Cost</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A single command imports complex functionality;</li>
                    <li><strong>Instant gratification</strong> induces dependency;</li>
                    <li>Developers need not understand underlying implementations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>(2) Dependency Visibility: "Availability" Replaces "Implementability"</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stars, downloads, and recommendations become selection criteria;</li>
                    <li><strong>Availability heuristic</strong> dominates decision-making.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>(3) Near-Zero Cost: Economic Incentives and Cognitive Laziness</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Free packages vs. self-implementation cost—<strong>minimizing opportunity cost</strong>;</li>
                    <li>Companies encourage "rapid iteration," discouraging "in-house innovation".</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>(4) Dependency Culture: From "Tool" to "Default Paradigm"</h4>

                        can we still preserve our <strong>technological subjectivity</strong>?<br>
                        Can we still be <strong>creators of technology</strong>, not just <strong>consumers of technology</strong>?
