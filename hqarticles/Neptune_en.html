            <p class="article-intro">In the boundless theater of the universe, Neptune has always played the role of a silent and profound supporting character. It lies far beyond the reach of sunlight, like a forgotten blue gem suspended in eternal twilight. Yet, this farthest planet from the Sun is far more than just a distant celestial body.</p>

                <h3>Part One: The Blue Illusion — The Philosophical Dilemma of Perception and Reality</h3>
                <p>Our first impression of Neptune is undoubtedly its deep, tranquil, and mysterious blue hue. Much like Earth's images from space, this shade of blue lends Neptune an intimate, almost watery gentleness. However, this initial sensory impression is a sophisticated cognitive trap.</p>
                
                <p>Neptune's blue is not the blue of an ocean. It stems from the selective absorption of red light by methane gas, which dominates its atmosphere—an optical magic resulting from the combined effects of scattering and absorption. What we "see" is not the planet's "true color," but a specific chord played by its atmospheric composition and sunlight on our human visual systems and imaging devices. This raises a profound philosophical question: How vast is the chasm between phenomenal reality and physical reality?</p>
                
                <p>The interior of this planet is starkly different from its serene exterior. It is a violent world, home to the most ferocious storm systems in the solar system, with winds reaching supersonic speeds of up to 2,000 kilometers per hour. Beneath that calm blue "face" lies the turbulent soul of an ice giant.</p>

                <h3>Part Two: The Mathematical Compass — How Technology Reshapes the Myth of Exploration</h3>
                <p>If our senses can lead us into illusion, then what can guide us closer to reality? The very discovery of Neptune provides a brilliant answer: mathematics.</p>
                
                <p>In 1846, Neptune was not "seen" through a telescope's偶然 sweep but was calculated into existence at precise coordinates by Urbain Le Verrier and John Couch Adams using Newton's law of universal gravitation, after which Johann Gottfried Galle observed it "targetedly." This was a great triumph of rationalism—the first time humanity predicted and captured an unknown world using pure logic and mathematics.</p>
                
                <p>From Voyager 2's historic flyby in 1989 to the deep gaze of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) today, our ways of engaging with Neptune have continually evolved. Voyager 2 lifted a corner of that blue veil, revealing for the first time its dynamic weather systems, faint yet complex ring systems, and the active moon Triton. JWST's infrared eyes go even further, piercing through the表象 of visible light to directly probe the heat structure and chemical composition of its atmosphere.</p>

                <h3>Part Three: The Diamond Shore — Materiality and Post-Human Imagination</h3>
                <p>When we use technology's compass to penetrate illusions and touch Neptune's physical reality, we encounter an extreme materiality that almost defies the imagination of Earth-bound life.</p>
                
                <p>Above its icy-rock core lies an "ice layer" that constitutes most of the planet's mass—a supercritical fluid hell composed of a mixture of water, ammonia, methane, and more. The pressure here is so immense (about hundreds of thousands of times Earth's atmospheric pressure) and the temperature so high (around thousands of degrees Celsius) that methane molecules are broken apart, and carbon atoms are compressed into a structure treasured on Earth—diamonds. Scientific models predict that it may rain eternal "diamond showers" inside Neptune, and there might even be a vast, liquid "diamond ocean" at its core.</p>
                
                <p>This imagery shifts our认知 from macroscopic orbital mechanics and atmospheric dynamics to microscopic quantum mechanics and high-pressure physics. Neptune's materiality becomes an ultimate form of alchemy, placing common elements (carbon, hydrogen) under extreme conditions to forge extraordinary material forms. This is not only a scientific marvel but also a powerful philosophical and literary image.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion: Redefining Humanity in the Blue Glow</h3>
                <p>From the blue illusion to mathematical prediction and then to the diamond ocean, Neptune's narrative outlines the complete arc of human cognitive expansion. It tells us that reality is not passively given but actively constructed. It is through weaving a complex web of perception, technology, and theory that we capture glimpses of the truth about that distant planet.</p>
                
                <p>Neptune, this blue mirror placed at the edge of the solar system, ultimately reflects ourselves. It reflects the limitations of our senses and the brilliance of our reason; it reflects the courage of our exploration and the ambition of our transformation. Every inquiry into Neptune ultimately circles back to questions about our own existence: How do we know? Why do we venture? What do we intend to achieve?</p>
                
                <p class="conclusion">That blue speck of light shimmering in the telescope thus becomes an eternal symbol of the human spirit. It symbolizes our eternal yearning for ultimate reality beneath appearances, our relentless use of mathematics and tools to push against cognitive boundaries, and our grand dream of projecting our will upon the stars and oceans.</p>
