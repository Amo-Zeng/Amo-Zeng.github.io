            <h3>I. Theoretical Foundations</h3>
            <h4>1. Emotion Recognition and Image Processing</h4>
            <p>Emotion recognition infers human emotional states by analyzing facial expressions, body language, or voice data from images. Its theoretical basis relies on research from psychology and neuroscience, using machine learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify and classify human emotions.</p>

            <h4>2. Dynamic Background Replacement in Augmented Reality</h4>
            <p>AR technology aims to seamlessly overlay virtual information onto the real world. Dynamic background replacement uses image processing to analyze and replace real-world scenes in real-time, relying on computer vision, image segmentation, and real-time rendering technologies.</p>

            <h4>3. Image Processing in Environmental Monitoring</h4>
            <p>Environmental monitoring uses image processing to analyze environmental data such as air quality, water quality, and vegetation coverage. In this field, image processing is mainly applied for feature extraction, object recognition, and change detection.</p>
