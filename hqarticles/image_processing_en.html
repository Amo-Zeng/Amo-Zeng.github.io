            <h2>Introduction: The Revolutionary Transformation of Image Processing</h2>
            <p>Image processing technology has made significant strides over the past few decades, evolving from simple filtering techniques to advanced deep learning generative models. Its applications have expanded from basic image enhancement to diverse fields such as virtual reality, medical imaging, and autonomous driving. However, as the complexity of application scenarios grows and the demand for image processing capabilities increases, the limitations of traditional methods become more apparent. The emergence of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) technology has brought revolutionary breakthroughs to the three-dimensional generation of static scenes. However, its ability to extend to dynamic scenes, as well as the improvement of model interpretability and computational efficiency, still face many challenges. At the same time, bio-inspired image processing methods offer a fresh perspective by drawing inspiration from the visual systems of organisms in nature, potentially breaking through the bottlenecks of traditional technologies. This article will delve into the integration of these cutting-edge technologies and explore future development directions in the field of image processing.</p>

            <h3>I. Spatiotemporal Dynamic Modeling: The Fusion of NeRF and Image Processing</h3>
            <h4>1.1 From Static to Dynamic: The Spatiotemporal Extension of NeRF</h4>
            <p>NeRF technology, with its outstanding 3D scene generation capabilities, has demonstrated enormous application potential in fields such as virtual reality, gaming, and film production. However, real-world scenes are often full of dynamic changes, such as shifts in lighting, object movement, and morphological evolution. Traditional NeRF models primarily focus on static scenes, making it difficult to effectively capture these dynamic elements. Therefore, introducing the time dimension into the NeRF framework to construct neural radiance fields capable of capturing dynamic changes has become an important research direction.</p>
            <p><strong>Innovation Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spatiotemporal Dynamic Modeling:</strong> By introducing the time dimension, NeRF models can capture dynamic information such as object motion, light changes, and material reflections, thereby achieving realistic rendering of complex spatiotemporal scenes. This dynamic modeling can significantly enhance the immersion of virtual environments and bring important application value in video compression, medical imaging, and other fields.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Computing and Inference:</strong> Real-time rendering of dynamic scenes demands higher computational efficiency. By optimizing the computational process and utilizing parallel computing and sparse representation technologies, the computational efficiency of the model can be significantly improved, achieving real-time inference and processing of dynamic scenes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.2 Multimodal Information Fusion: Enhancing Dynamic Scene Understanding</h4>
            <p>Modeling dynamic scenes requires the integration of information from different modalities, such as images, videos, depth information, and motion trajectories. How to effectively fuse these multimodal information sources to enhance the model's understanding and representation of dynamic scenes is another key direction in advancing NeRF technology.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Medical Image Analysis:</strong> In the medical field, model interpretability is crucial. Doctors need to understand how the model identifies lesions, what features are considered key indicators, and whether the model's prediction results are reliable. A transparent and interpretable model can help doctors build trust in the model and use it as an auxiliary tool for diagnosis and treatment.</li>
                <li><strong>Autonomous Driving:</strong> Autonomous driving systems rely on accurate perception and understanding of the surrounding environment. An interpretable image generation and processing model can help developers understand how the system makes decisions, increasing system trustworthiness.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.2 Innovation Directions for Enhancing Model Interpretability</h4>
