            <h2>The Dilemma and Reconstruction of the Digital Age: From Digital Divide to Value Transformation</h2>
            <p>The rapid development of digital technology is propelling human society into a new historical phase. This digital wave not only reshapes our lifestyles and social structures but also profoundly changes our ways of perceiving and understanding the world. However, beneath the technological benefits, we face unprecedented challenges: **The digital divide exacerbates social stratification, algorithmic hegemony and data monopoly erode the foundation of fair competition, while "lying flat" and "involution" reflect the deep-seated crises of the contemporary social value system.** These issues are not isolated but interwoven, collectively forming the complex and profound dilemmas of the digital age. Addressing these challenges is not only crucial for the future direction of technological development but also for the survival and progress of human civilization. We need to explore a new social order and value system at the intersection of technology and ethics.</p>

            <h3>I. The Digital Divide: Social Stratification in the Technological Revolution</h3>
            <p>The普及 of digital technology should ideally serve as an opportunity to bridge social gaps and promote equality. However, the reality presents a different picture: **The divide between "digital natives" and "digital refugees" is becoming a new marker of social stratification.** This divide is not only material but also profoundly affects people's ways of thinking, behavior patterns, and social status.</p>
            <h4>Deep-rooted Causes of the Digital Divide</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Inequitable Distribution of Technological Resources:</strong> The普及 of digital technology is closely related to economic development levels. In developed regions, high-speed internet, smart devices, and digitalized services have become part of the infrastructure; in less developed areas, these resources remain scarce, severely marginalizing "digital refugees" in their ability to access knowledge and information.</li>
                <li><strong>Solidification Effect of Social Structures:</strong> The digital divide is not just a gap in technical capabilities but also an inequality in social capital and opportunities. "Digital natives" accumulate extensive social relationships and resources through technological platforms, while "digital refugees" are excluded from these networks, forming new social barriers.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Identity Disruption:</strong> The digital age has given rise to a new cultural form, from social interactions to consumption habits, starkly contrasting with traditional society. "Digital refugees" risk being marginalized by mainstream society due to their inability to integrate into this culture.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Social Consequences of the Digital Divide</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Educational Stratification:</strong> The richness of digital educational resources has not equalized educational opportunities, instead exacerbating the "knowledge gap" and widening the generational divide.</li>
                <li><strong>Employment Exclusion:</strong> The high skill requirements of the digital economy place "digital refugees" at a disadvantage in the labor market, further solidifying social classes.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Isolation:</strong> The prevalence of online social interactions makes physical distance irrelevant, yet "digital refugees" are unable to participate in this social model, leading to deeper social isolation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Paths to Overcome the Digital Divide</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Technology for Good:</strong> Tech companies should not only pursue commercial interests but also take on social responsibility by designing more inclusive technical solutions to help "digital refugees" integrate into the digital society.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Innovation:</strong> Governments and social organizations should promote innovative public service models, such as community-based digital skills training and intergenerational knowledge-sharing platforms, to bridge the technological gap.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Integration:</strong> Through multicultural exchange and integration, break down the cultural barriers of the digital age, allowing people from different backgrounds to find their place in the digital society.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>II. Algorithmic Hegemony and Data Monopoly: The博弈 of Technical Rationality and Social Equity</h3>
            <p>Algorithms and data are becoming the dominant forces in modern society. However, this "rationality" of technology is often monopolized by a few enterprises, leading to new social injustices. **Algorithmic hegemony not only redefines market rules but also profoundly changes the social power structure.**</p>
            <h4>The Logic of Algorithmic Hegemony</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Technological Powerization:</strong> Algorithm designers and controllers predict and manipulate user behavior through technical means, thereby dominating the market.</li>
                <li><strong>Information Differentiation:</strong> Algorithmic recommendation mechanisms limit user information access, creating "information茧房" and exacerbating social polarization.</li>
                <li><strong>Innovation Restriction:</strong> Data monopolies make it difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises to access critical resources, stifling market vitality and innovation capability.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Hazards of Data Monopoly</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Economic Inequality:</strong> A few companies profit excessively through data monopolies, while ordinary users and SMEs are excluded from wealth distribution.</li>
                <li><strong>Shaky Social Trust:</strong> The risks of data misuse lower public trust in technology, affecting the formation of social consensus.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Challenges:</strong> The black-box operations of algorithms make technical decisions lack transparency and accountability, leading to profound ethical debates.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Paths to Reconstruct Technical Rationality</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Ethics-Driven Technical Design:</strong> Introduce ethical considerations in algorithm development to ensure technology serves human welfare rather than the interests of a few.</li>
                <li><strong>Establishment of Public Data Platforms:</strong> Implement government-led data-sharing mechanisms to break data monopolies and promote market diversification and competition.</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement of Algorithmic Accountability Mechanisms:</strong> Establish transparent and explainable algorithmic regulatory systems to ensure technical decisions are traceable and accountable.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>III. Lying Flat and Involution: Value Transformation in the Post-Materialist Era</h3>
            <p>"Lying flat" and "involution" are not just survival states for contemporary youth but a concentrated reflection of the imbalance in the social value system. In the wave of materialism, traditional success standards have gradually become obsolete, while a new value system has yet to form, leading to confusion in the pursuit of happiness.</p>
            <h4>The Dilemma of Materialism</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Failure of Traditional Values:</strong> Since the industrial civilization, wealth and status have been considered the sole standards of success. However, in the digital age, this single evaluation system no longer satisfies people's spiritual needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Stagnation of Social Mobility:</strong> The trend of class solidification makes it difficult for ordinary people to change their destiny through effort, leading to disappointment and distrust in the social system.</li>
                <li><strong>External Dependence on Happiness:</strong> Material abundance has not brought inner satisfaction but has instead intensified comparison and competition among people.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Value Transformation in the Post-Materialist Era</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Shift from Material to Spiritual:</strong> In the post-materialist era, people begin to pursue higher-level spiritual fulfillment, including self-actualization, emotional connections, and social contributions.</li>
                <li><strong>Reconstruction of Multiple Values:</strong> Success is no longer defined solely by wealth and status but extends to personal interests, social influence, and the realization of life meaning.</li>
                <li><strong>Rebuilding of Social Communities:</strong> Moving beyond individualism, focusing on social fairness and human welfare becomes a new value pursuit in the era.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Paths to Reconstruct the Value System</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cultural Leadership:</strong> Shape value concepts that align with the spirit of the times through cultural innovation, guiding people to pursue higher-level life meaning.</li>
                <li><strong>Institutional Safeguards:</strong> Improve the social security system to ensure everyone has fair development opportunities and alleviate social anxiety.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Practice:</strong> Encourage people to explore the possibilities of the spiritual world beyond material pursuit and find their own path to happiness.</li>
            </ol>
