            <h2>Reconfiguring the Role of Theater in the Digital Age</h2>
            <p>In today’s attention-scarce society, the functions of theater are undergoing profound transformation. Previously centered on entertainment and storytelling, theater is now driven by both digital innovation and shifts in social structure to take on new roles—connecting people, fostering empathy, and even supporting psychological healing.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Level One: Capturing Attention</h3>
            <p>In the age of information overload, grabbing the audience’s attention has become paramount. Modern theater continuously integrates multimedia, immersive experiences, and cross-disciplinary storytelling to enhance its appeal.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Immersive Theater:</strong> Through multisensory engagement, the audience transitions from observer to participant, deepening focus and immersion.</li>
                <li><strong>Live-Streamed Theater:</strong> Breaking spatial limits, digital platforms enable theater to reach broader audiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Industry Collaboration:</strong> Combining theater with tech, gaming, and music creates buzz and drives engagement.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Level Two: Empathy and Social Connection</h3>
            <p>Audiences no longer just want to be “captivated”—they seek to be “understood.” By dramatizing shared experiences and shedding light on marginalized voices, theater sparks emotional resonance and fosters empathy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Verbatim Theater:</strong> Using real-life stories told by everyday people, it prompts audiences to empathize with societal issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive Dramatic Scenarios:</strong> Audience influence over the storyline enhances immersion and understanding of others’ struggles.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Theater:</strong> Tailored to local audiences, it centers on shared memory or societal concerns, strengthening social bonds.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Level Three: Psychological Healing and Personal Growth</h3>
            <p>Theater is increasingly moving beyond performance itself to become a medium for healing and self-discovery. Its value is evident in mental health interventions, youth education, and trauma recovery.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Applied Theater:</strong> Used in mental health support, childhood education, and refugee rehabilitation initiatives.</li>
                <li><strong>Drama Therapy:</strong> Role-playing and storytelling help individuals express and process internal conflicts.</li>
                <li><strong>Participatory Creation:</strong> Audience involvement in performance fosters self-expression and emotional growth.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Theater’s New Mission: From Audience to Participant, From Entertainment to Co-Creation</h3>
            <p>In a rapidly evolving world, the future of theater lies in becoming a collaborative, adaptive, and transformative art form that connects deeply with individuals and society.</p>
