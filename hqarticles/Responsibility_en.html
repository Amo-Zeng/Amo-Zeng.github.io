                <h2>【Prologue】</h2>
                <p>The midnight city awakens through neural network-like capillaries, with algorithmic reflections splashing across 3D holographic billboards, propelling Baudrillard's simulacrum world into an ultra-HD epoch. As generative AI begins to articulate apology syntax for its "hallucinatory" outputs, and DAO organizations vote on-chain about whether to pardon rogue smart contracts, we must interrogate: What topological metamorphosis has the ethical subject - deconstructed and reassembled by Foucault - undergone in this quantum-entangled world?</p>

                <h3>【1. Ontological Collapse and Spectral Manifestation】</h3>
                <p>The Cartesian theater's contemplating "cogito" is being dismembered into discrete data packets by neuroscience and AI algorithms. Foucault's technologies of the self meet fatal backlash in the brain-computer interface era - as Musk's Neuralink commercializes thought exportation rights, as napping brainwaves become new veins for the attention economy, subject production has degenerated into programmable components on cyborg assembly lines.</p>

                <h3>【2. Liquid Contracts and the Blockchain Theater】</h3>
                <p>Social contract theory undergoes graphene-like phase transitions in the Web3.0 era. Ethereum's self-executing smart contract systems deconstruct Rousseau's general will into price curves resonating across network nodes. The collective intelligence collapse demonstrated in ConstitutionDAO's 2023 incident exposes the essential contradiction of liquid responsibility.</p>

                <h3>【3. The Performance Art of Responsibility in an Entropic Universe】</h3>
                <p>Within brain-machine interface enhanced consciousness ecosystems, traditional ethical frameworks experience quantum decoherence. In the courtroom where Neuralink users sue Tesla's autonomous driving system for hallucination-inducing accidents, the neural impulse data recorded by both parties' brain-computer interfaces propel Habermas' theory of communicative action into hyperreal dimensions.</p>

                <h2>【Epilogue】</h2>
                <p>The future human-machine responsibility collective might adopt blockchain timestamp tracing mechanisms, executing discrete obligation calculations in nonlinear spacetime; or perhaps develop Neural Darwinian moral evolution algorithms, achieving swarm intelligence emergence in ethical decision-making through spiking neural networks.</p>
