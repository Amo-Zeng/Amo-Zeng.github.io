            <h2>Profound Transformation of the Rescue Model</h2>
            <p>Throughout human history, in the face of natural disasters, wars, unrest, and personal困境, "waiting for rescue" has been a prevalent psychological state. This dependency not only stems from an excessive reliance on external environments but also reflects an individual's lack of self-awareness and proactive response in difficult situations. However, with the awakening of personal consciousness and the development of society, we gradually realize that true strength comes from within. The construction of self-reliance and a resilient society is the most reliable approach.</p>

            <h3>I. The Psychological Roots and Limitations of Waiting for Rescue</h3>
            <p>The psychological state of "waiting for rescue" often arises from people's excessive reliance on external environments. In traditional social structures, individuals are often given less autonomy and decision-making power, relying more on collective or authoritative guidance. This dependency is particularly evident in times of crisis when people habitually expect rescue from outside, whether from the government, organizations, or family and friends.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the high division of labor and specialization in modern society exacerbate this dependency. Many people, due to long-term involvement in a single job or lifestyle, gradually lose the ability to handle complex problems. Once faced with an emergency, they fall into a state of helplessness and anxiety. This state is not only limited at the individual level but also problematic at the social level. The traditional "single disaster type" response model, such as emergency plans and rescue measures for specific disaster types like earthquakes managed by the earthquake bureau and meteorological disasters managed by the meteorological bureau, has obvious limitations. This model leads to information silos, resource dispersion, and lack of resilience, making it difficult to respond to compound disasters.</p>

            <h3>II. Awakening of Self-Reliance and Multi-Disaster Joint Prevention and Control</h3>
            <p>However, with the improvement of personal consciousness and social development, more and more people begin to reconsider the rationality of this dependency. The concept of self-rescue gradually rises, which is not only an improvement in survival skills but also a transformation of psychological state.</p>
            <p>First, self-rescue emphasizes the inner potential of the individual. Every person has immense power within themselves, often suppressed by external environments. Through self-exploration and practice, people can discover and release these potentials, thus enhancing their ability to cope with crises. Secondly, self-rescue is also the cultivation of psychological resilience. Faced with difficulties, self-reliants do not easily fall into despair but actively think and act to find solutions. This cultivation of psychological resilience not only helps in overcoming the current crisis but also improves overall well-being and the quality of life.</p>
            <p>At the social level, the concept of multi-disaster joint prevention and control has emerged as an important way to enhance social resilience and resist disaster risks. Facing increasingly complex disaster risks, establishing a comprehensive disaster prevention, reduction, and relief system of "multi-disaster joint prevention and control" is an inevitable choice to meet challenges. By breaking information barriers, achieving data sharing, integrating emergency resources, enhancing coordination efficiency, strengthening risk awareness, and improving resilience capabilities, a society accustomed to self-reliance and joint prevention and control is more capable of dealing with various challenges.</p>

            <h3>III. From Material Rescue to Psychological Rescue: Deepening Humanistic Care</h3>
            <p>In disaster response models, "material rescue" has always been the primary means, providing immediate material assistance such as food, water, clothing, temporary shelter, and medical aid to meet the survival needs of disaster victims. However, with time and social development, we gradually realize that disasters bring not only physical harm but also psychological trauma. Long-term fear, anxiety, sadness, and other negative emotions, if not effectively addressed, may cause long-term or permanent damage to the psychological health of disaster victims.</p>
            <p>Therefore, "psychological rescue" has emerged and gradually become an integral part of disaster relief efforts. Psychological rescue is not just simple comfort and encouragement but includes professional psychological assessment, intervention, and reconstruction. Through psychological rescue, disaster victims can gradually step out of the shadow of disaster under the help of professionals, regaining confidence and courage for life. For example, after some major disasters, psychologists and social workers quickly intervene, providing group counseling, individual consulting, psychological education, and other services to help rebuild psychological defense lines and regain hope for life.</p>
