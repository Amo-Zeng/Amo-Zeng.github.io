            <h2>Multidimensional Exploration of Performing Arts: From Non-Human Characters to the Social Media Era</h2>
            <p>In the vast galaxy of performing arts, human roles are undoubtedly dazzling, but non-human characters constantly challenge actors' limits and expand the boundaries of performance with their unique charm. From portraying animals to giving life to AI and materializing intangible souls, these performance tasks revolve around the delicate balance between "likeness" and "authenticity"â€”a realism that retains artistic creativity while convincing the audience.</p>

            <h3>1. From "Physical Resemblance" to "Spiritual Resemblance": The Art of Portraying Animal Characters</h3>
            <p>Portraying animals is far from simple imitation. Starting with "physical resemblance," actors must carefully observe and mimic the movements, habits, and expressions of animals, but this is only the beginning. True artistry lies in breaking through the surface to achieve "spiritual resemblance." Actors must deeply understand animals' instincts, emotions, and social structures and integrate them into their performances.</p>

            <h3>2. The Fusion of Rationality and Emotion: The Challenge of Portraying AI Characters</h3>
            <p>Compared to animal characters, AI characters are more complex to portray. AI is highly rational and logical but lacks human emotional experiences. Actors portraying AI must find a balance between rationality and emotion, accurately presenting AI's thought processes and language styles while imbuing them with a degree of humanity.</p>

            <h3>3. Transcending Physical Constraints: The Sublimation of Portraying Soul Characters</h3>
            <p>Portraying soul characters is the pinnacle of performing arts. How can an intangible spirit be materialized on stage? This not only tests an actor's expressiveness but also challenges their understanding of the essence of life.</p>

            <h3>4. The Dialectic of "Likeness" and "Authenticity": The Essence of Portraying Non-Human Characters</h3>
            <p>The core of portraying non-human characters lies in the dialectical unity of "likeness" and "authenticity." Actors cannot fully "be" the character, as this would lose the tension and aesthetic distance of artistic creation; nor can they merely "resemble" the character, as this would fail to touch the audience's hearts.</p>

            <h3>5. Performing in the Social Media Era: The Artistic Reconstruction of Authenticity</h3>
            <p>In the era of social media, performing arts are undergoing unprecedented transformations. The rise of short video platforms like TikTok and Instagram has not only changed how audiences watch performances but also redefined the forms and content of performance.</p>

            <h3>6. Conclusion: The Boundaries and Future of Performing Arts</h3>
            <p>In the vast galaxy of performing arts, the boundaries of performance are constantly expanding. Whether it's the authentic portrayal of non-human characters or the artistic reconstruction of authenticity in the social media era, both are redefining the forms and content of performance.</p>
