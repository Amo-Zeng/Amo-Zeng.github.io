            <h2>Neurovascular Unit: Bridging Cognition, Disease, and Brain-Computer Interfaces</h2>
            <p>For a long time, the neurovascular unit (NVU) has been regarded as a supportive structure of the brain, primarily responsible for providing oxygen and nutrients to neurons and clearing metabolic waste. However, with deeper research, the functions of the NVU extend far beyond this. It is not merely a material transport system but also an active participant in the regulation of neural network activities. This discovery provides a novel perspective for understanding cognitive function, brain diseases, and brain-computer interface (BCI) technology.</p>

            <h3>From "Vascular-Neural Network" to "Cognitive Network": The Deep Connection Between NVU and Cognitive Function</h3>
            <p>Traditional NVU research has confined it to material support for neuron survival, neglecting its profound impact on neuronal network activity and cognitive function. In recent years, an increasing amount of research has shown that different components of the NVU, including microvascular density, blood-brain barrier integrity, and neuroinflammation levels, are closely related to synaptic plasticity, neural network dynamics, and ultimately cognitive function.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microvascular Density</strong>: Microvessels are not only channels for nutrient transport, but their density and distribution also directly affect the blood supply and metabolic levels of local brain regions. Areas with high microvascular density typically exhibit stronger learning and memory abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity</strong>: The stability of the blood-brain barrier is crucial for maintaining the balance of the internal environment of the central nervous system. Damage to it can lead to neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases, subsequently affecting cognitive function.</li>
                <li><strong>Neuroinflammation Levels</strong>: Moderate neuroinflammation can promote synaptic pruning and neural network remodeling, while excessive or persistent inflammation can harm cognitive function.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Based on these findings, we need to construct a concept of a "cognitive network," linking the NVU with synaptic plasticity, neural network dynamics, and higher cognitive functions. The NVU influences the formation, maintenance, and reorganization of synapses by regulating local metabolism, neurotransmitter concentration, and neurotrophic factor levels, thereby modulating synaptic plasticity. Moreover, dynamic changes in the NVU affect neuronal excitability and connectivity, altering the topology and information processing capabilities of neural networks, ultimately impacting advanced cognitive functions such as learning, memory, and decision-making.</p>

            <h3>Multidimensional Network Imbalance: A New Paradigm for Brain Diseases</h3>
            <p>For a long time, the study of brain disease etiology has followed a "single cause" approach, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) being considered a cascade reaction triggered by β-amyloid deposition, and Parkinson's disease (PD) being attributed to the misfolding of α-synuclein. However, this reductionist perspective overlooks the essential characteristics of the brain as a complex system. In recent years, the concept of the NVU has provided new insights into understanding brain diseases.</p>
            <p>The NVU views neurons, glial cells, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, stromal cells, and the extracellular matrix as an interdependent functional network. The root cause of brain diseases can be considered an imbalance in the NVU network, rather than an abnormality in a single component. This imbalance is multidimensional, encompassing vascular dysfunction, neuroinflammation, metabolic disorders, oxidative stress, extracellular matrix remodeling, and complex interactions among these factors.</p>
            <p>Take AD as an example. The traditional "amyloid hypothesis" regards β-amyloid deposition as the core of the disease, but an increasing number of studies show that amyloid deposition is just the tip of the iceberg. Imbalances in the NVU network, such as cerebrovascular dysfunction leading to abnormal cerebral blood flow regulation, neuroinflammation mediated by microglia, and energy metabolism disorders caused by metabolic imbalance, all play important roles in the onset and progression of the disease, interacting with other factors to ultimately cause neuronal damage and cognitive decline.</p>

            <h3>From "Passive Monitoring" to "Active Regulation": Applications of NVU in Brain-Computer Interfaces</h3>
            <p>Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology represents humanity's pursuit of direct communication between the brain and machines. Traditional BCI systems primarily rely on "passive monitoring" of neuronal activity, i.e., interpreting neural signals by recording electrical activity from the cerebral cortex (such as EEG, ECoG) and converting them into commands to control external devices. However, this "bottom-up" signal acquisition method, while effective, still has limitations such as low signal resolution and susceptibility to interference.</p>
            <p>With the deepening of NVU research, NVU information provides BCI with new signal sources and regulatory means. NVU information (such as blood oxygen levels, vasomotion, etc.) is closely related to neural activity, offering a richer perspective for BCI signal acquisition and regulation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Precise Decoding</strong>: Traditional BCI systems primarily rely on electrical signal monitoring, while the introduction of NVU information provides BCI with a richer signal source. For example, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) indirectly reflects neural activity by monitoring changes in cerebral blood flow, offering high spatial resolution; near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) reflects neural activity by detecting changes in tissue blood oxygen levels, providing better temporal resolution and portability.</li>
                <li><strong>Functional Regulation</strong>: NVU can not only serve as a signal source but also be actively regulated to intervene in neural function and behavior. For example, optogenetics uses light-sensitive proteins and specific wavelengths of light to precisely control neuronal activity; ultrasound stimulation changes neuronal excitability through low-intensity ultrasound; vasoactive drugs influence local brain region metabolism and neural activity by regulating vasomotion and blood flow.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These NVU regulation technologies can be combined with traditional BCI systems to achieve bidirectional regulation of neural activity: on one hand, using BCI to monitor NVU information to interpret neural signals; on the other hand, using BCI to control NVU regulation technologies to intervene in neural function, thereby achieving more precise and personalized brain-machine interaction.</p>

            <h3>Looking Ahead: Multidisciplinary Integration and Technological Innovation in NVU Research</h3>
            <p>Exploring the role of the NVU in cognitive function, brain diseases, and brain-computer interfaces requires interdisciplinary integration, including neuroscience, vascular biology, immunology, computational biology, cognitive psychology, and more. Meanwhile, advanced imaging technologies, such as two-photon imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging, can be used to observe the dynamic interactions between NVU activity and cognitive processes in real time.</p>
            <p>Future research directions include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Building NVU Network Models</strong>: Using computational biology and systems biology methods to construct NVU network models, simulating the dynamic changes and interactions of NVU components under different brain disease states, and revealing the network mechanisms of disease occurrence.</li>
                <li><strong>Identifying Early Biomarkers of NVU Imbalance</strong>: Developing highly sensitive and specific biomarkers to monitor dynamic changes in the NVU network, enabling early diagnosis and risk prediction of brain diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Developing NVU-Targeted Therapeutic Strategies</strong>: Designing treatment plans at the system level to synergistically act on the NVU network and improve disease prognosis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>As a complex biological network, the NVU is not only the core of brain material transport and metabolism but also a key regulator of neural network activity and cognitive function. By constructing a "cognitive network," understanding the mechanisms of multidimensional network imbalance, and applying it to BCI technology, we have the potential to open new research fields, providing important support for the diagnosis, treatment of brain diseases, and the advancement of brain-machine interaction technology. As NVU research deepens and multidisciplinary technologies integrate, we look forward to unveiling more mysteries of brain function and ultimately achieving precise control of brain function, benefiting human health.</p>
