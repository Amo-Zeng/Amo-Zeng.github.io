            <h2>The Symbolic Maze of Theater Space: From the Red Ghost to the Digital Mirror</h2>
            <p>In the profound space of theater, symbols roam like ghosts, sometimes appearing and sometimes hiding, constantly reshaping the audience's perception and understanding. Whether it's the ancient Red Ghost or the modern digital mirror, symbols remain the core driving force of theatrical art. They are not just visual decorations but metaphors of existence, connecting reality with illusion, and individuals with the collective through a spiritual bond.</p>

            <h3>The Red Ghost: The Life of Symbolic Disintegration</h3>
            <p>Red, as one of the most symbolic elements in theater, has long transcended its mere chromatic significance. It is both the essence of life and the omen of death; both a warning of power and the eruption of passion. In ancient Greek tragedy, red symbolizes the majesty of the Fates; in Shakespeare's "Macbeth," it is a bloody metaphor for power and desire; in Brecht's "Mother Courage," it becomes the spark of revolutionary passion. The polysemy of this symbol turns the stage into an open field of meaning, where the audience is both a receiver and a co-creator of meaning.</p>
            <p>The symbolic nature of red is not limited to the visual level but extends into the ontological dimension of existence. Blood, as the essence of life, transforms into the red symbol on stage, becoming a spiritual bond connecting life, death, power, and desire. This reconstruction is not merely a visual embellishment but an ontological presentation of existence. As the audience watches, they are not just interpreting symbols but experiencing a possible form of existence.</p>

            <h3>The Mirror's Realm: The Paradoxical Beauty of the Symbolic Game</h3>
            <p>Mirrors, as another classic theatrical symbol, showcase the ambiguity and multi-dimensionality of symbols. They are tools for self-reflection, spells that divide illusion from reality, and metaphors of power struggles. In "Hamlet," Polonius uses the mirror to transmit information to the king, where the mirror serves as both a surveillance tool and an indication of the omnipresent gaze and control within the power arena. Through the reflection of mirrors, theater breaks free from the constraints of linear time, creating multiple narrative dimensions.</p>
            <p>The playfulness of mirrors lies not only in their temporal and spatial reconstruction but also in their profound questioning of human cognitive essence. The distorted reflections in the mirror hint at the limitations and deception of self-perception. When an actor performs in front of a mirror, they are not only interpreting a role but engaging in a philosophical debate about authenticity. The reflectivity of mirrors blurs the boundaries between reality and illusion, forcing the audience to confront the uncertainties of life.</p>
            <p>In modern theater, mirrors serve as a medium for reshaping the audience-performer relationship. They can become a barrier between actors and the audience or a bridge connecting the two. Brecht's "Verfremdungseffekt" breaks the continuity of the mirror image, compelling the audience to detach emotionally and think rationally. In some avant-garde theater, mirrors can even become a space for audience self-projection, completely dissolving the boundaries between performer and audience.</p>

            <h3>The Smartphone: The Folded Curtain, The Lost Maze</h3>
            <p>With technological advancements, the carriers of symbols continue to evolve. The smartphone, as the most representative everyday item in modern society, has become a new focal symbol on the theatrical stage. It is no longer a cold communication tool but a mystical symbol connecting reality with illusion and individuals with the collective. In "The Net," the protagonist's identity crisis ensues from a lost phone; in "The Dark Room," the flickering phone screen becomes a dual metaphor for spying on others' lives and self-exposure; in "The Disconnection," the interruption of the phone signal foretells the disintegration of society and interpersonal relationships.</p>
            <p>As a medium between theater and reality, the smartphone opens a window to observe contemporary society. It is a symbol of loneliness, as when people stare at their screens, the whole world becomes a monologue; it is a metaphor of dependence, where modern people treat their phones like ancient Romans treated their gods; it is a carrier of spying, as the rapid development of social media makes the distance between people both close and distant; it is a symbol of loss, as losing a phone means losing not just a communication tool but a crucial support for constructing one's world.</p>
            <p>The emergence of smartphones marks a new height in the "disenchantment" movement of theatrical symbols. They are no longer meticulously designed symbolic elements but familiar companions already in the audience's pockets. By dramatizing the smartphone, modern theater not only expands the boundaries of symbolism but also offers a unique perspective to reflect on our own existential state.</p>

            <h3>The Eternal Pursuit of Symbols</h3>
            <p>Whether it's the Red Ghost, the mirror's realm, or the folded curtain of the smartphone, symbols remain the core of theatrical art. They continuously reconstruct on stage, challenging the audience's cognitive boundaries and inviting them to engage in this exploration of existence. Each audience member can see their own reflection in the symbols, but this reflection always carries a subtle deviation, which is the charm of the theatrical symbolic game.</p>
            <p>In this era of information overload, theater, as a unique art form, still maintains its poetic inquiry into existence. Symbols, especially those like red, mirrors, and smartphones, gain an eternal vitality in the theatrical space. They transcend specific representations, becoming metaphors for existence itself. When we gaze at these symbols in the theater, we see not just performances but the essence of life and the eternal pursuit of meaning.</p>
            <p>The symbolic maze of theater is endless, both an artistic labyrinth and an existential one. In this maze, each audience member can find their own interpretation path, and it is this openness and possibility of interpretation that keeps theatrical art eternally vibrant.</p>
