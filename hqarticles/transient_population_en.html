            <h2>Digital Inclusion and Community Co-Construction of Migratory Population</h2>
            <p>In today's world swept by the digital wave, the migratory population, as an important group in the urbanization process, faces unique challenges and opportunities. Traditional studies on migratory population often focus on macro-level issues such as household registration systems and social security, overlooking their unique difficulties in the digital age. This article will explore how the migratory population embraces a smart future and shares the benefits of digital economic development from three perspectives: the current "digital disadvantage" status of the migratory population, the impact of intelligence on their lives, and the path to bridging the "digital divide". Additionally, this article will discuss the role transformation of the migratory population in community governance and how to build an educational system centered on "humanistic care" to help the children of migratory population better integrate into urban life.</p>

            <h3>The "Digital Disadvantage" Status of Migratory Population</h3>
            <p>The migratory population often finds itself at the end of the "digital divide," which is mainly reflected in the following aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Skill Deficiency</strong>: Many migratory population lack basic skills to use smartphones and the internet, unable to effectively utilize digital tools to solve daily problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Constraints</strong>: Economic conditions limit their ability to purchase smart devices. Even if they own devices, they may not be able to use them continuously due to cost issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Single Information Acquisition Channels</strong>: The migratory population often relies on limited social networks for information, lacking diverse channels to access information, making it difficult to stay updated with the latest technology and policy information.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Impact of Intelligence on the Lives of Migratory Population</h3>
            <p>Intelligence is profoundly changing the lifestyles of the migratory population, mainly reflected in the following aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Employment Opportunities</strong>: Sharing economy platforms such as ride-hailing and food delivery provide flexible employment opportunities for the migratory population. They can easily receive orders through smartphones and increase their income.</li>
                <li><strong>Educational Resources</strong>: Online education platforms offer the migratory population a wealth of learning resources, helping them improve their skills and enhance their competitiveness. For example, learning new skills through online courses and obtaining professional qualification certificates.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Services</strong>: Intelligent medical services enable the migratory population to make appointments, consult doctors online, and enjoy convenient medical resources. Especially during special periods such as the pandemic, the popularity of online medical services has provided them with significant convenience.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Pathways to Bridging the "Digital Divide"</h3>
            <p>To help the migratory population cross the digital barrier and share the benefits of digital economic development, it requires the joint efforts of the government, enterprises, and social organizations:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Digital Skill Training</strong>: The government and relevant institutions should organize digital skill training for the migratory population to enhance their information literacy and digital operation capabilities. For example, through community training centers and public welfare projects, teaching basic knowledge such as smartphone usage and cybersecurity.</li>
                <li><strong>Building Information Service Platforms</strong>: The government and enterprises can cooperate to build information service platforms for the migratory population, providing employment, education, medical and other information services to help them better integrate into urban life. For example, developing dedicated applications to integrate various resources and provide one-stop services.</li>
                <li><strong>Reducing the Cost of Using Smart Devices</strong>: The government can lower the cost of using smart devices through subsidies, discounts, etc., to help the migratory population better access digital life. For example, collaborating with telecom operators to provide affordable internet packages, ensuring they can afford network usage fees.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>From "Guest" to "Co-Builder of a Common Home"</h3>
            <p>For a long time, the migratory population in cities has been seen as "guests," with ambiguous identities and difficult to establish in-depth social connections with local residents. This "guest" mentality is not only a subjective feeling of the migratory population but also a social objective perception. Their lives in the city often revolve around work and residence, with little opportunity to participate in community public affairs, forming a sense of belonging to the "common home."</p>
            <p>In the process of urbanization, the migratory population is not only an important part of the labor market but also a main force in promoting urban development and social progress. However, their participation and sense of belonging are far lower than that of local residents. This is not only a social issue but also an urgent urban governance issue. How to provide channels and opportunities for the migratory population to participate in community governance, transforming them from "guests" to active builders of the city's "common home," has become an important topic in current urban governance.</p>
            <p>To promote the transformation of the migratory population from "guest" to urban "co-builder of a common home," innovative community governance models are imperative. By establishing platforms for the migratory population to participate, ensuring their right to know, participate, and supervise, it not only helps to enhance their community sense of belonging but also comprehensively improves community governance effectiveness, jointly building a beautiful city.</p>
            <p>First, innovating community governance models is key. Traditional community governance models often focus on local residents' participation, ignoring the diversity and needs of the migratory population. The "deliberative consultation" model, such as "community hearings" and "democratic deliberative meetings," can be used to encourage the migratory population to participate in discussions and decision-making on major community affairs. By regularly holding migratory population deliberative meetings, setting fixed topics and discussion times, their presence and voice can be elevated. At the same time, leveraging information technology, a digital community governance platform can be established, allowing the migratory population to easily access the latest information and participation opportunities through mobile apps, WeChat public accounts, etc.</p>
            <p>Second, channels for the migratory population to participate in community governance should be established and improved. Although many communities have set up seats for the migratory population, their practical application and effectiveness are limited. A "migratory population community advisory group" can be set up, with community neighborhood committees regularly convening these group members to discuss important community affairs and listen to their voices and suggestions. Additionally, a "community volunteer action plan" can be promoted, encouraging the migratory population to participate in community service projects such as environmental cleaning and educational support, enhancing their sense of identity and belonging to the community through volunteer activities.</p>
            <p>Ensuring the right to know, participate, and supervise for the migratory population is also essential. In terms of right to know, a transparent and efficient community information disclosure mechanism should be established to ensure the migratory population can obtain timely and comprehensive community governance information. Regularly publishing community affairs newsletters and news bulletins, conducting multilingual propaganda through multiple channels, can meet the information needs of different migratory populations. In terms of right to participate, the community should clearly define the rights and obligations of the migratory population in community governance, ensuring they have equal qualifications and opportunities to participate in community affairs. In terms of right to supervise, a migratory population supervision committee can be established to supervise and evaluate the implementation of community governance, providing timely feedback on their opinions and suggestions.</p>
            <p>Promoting interaction and communication between the migratory population and local residents is an important path to achieving community integration. Activities such as "community cultural festivals" and "multi-cultural exchange activities" can be organized, enhancing mutual understanding and feelings between the migratory population and local residents through various forms such as art performances, sports competitions, and knowledge lectures. Additionally, a "community neighborhood mutual assistance network" can be established, enhancing interaction and support among community residents through regular visits and mutual assistance activities, achieving a true community collective.</p>
            <p>Linking up with social forces, such as non-governmental organizations and enterprises, can also play an important role in encouraging the migratory population to participate in community governance. Non-governmental organizations can provide professional training and resource support to help the migratory population improve their skills and confidence in community participation. Enterprises can promote the implementation and development of community governance projects through project cooperation or funding support. For example, a community successfully attracted multiple enterprises to participate through the "enterprise community cooperation plan," not only providing funding support but also organizing employees to participate in community volunteer service activities, achieving good social effects.</p>

            <h3>From "Capital Game" to "Humanistic Care": In-Depth Exploration of the Education Issues of Migratory Population Children</h3>
            <p>The education issues of the children of the migratory population have always been the focus of social attention. However, long-term policy formulation and implementation often revolve around issues such as "enrollment rate" and "college entrance exam migration," lacking an in-depth understanding of the physical and mental development characteristics and educational needs of migratory children. This article will analyze the impact of the education concept of "enrollment rate supremacy" on migratory children from the perspective of "capital game," explore the diversified educational needs of migratory children, and call for the construction of an educational system centered on "humanistic care."</p>
            <h4>I. The "Utilitarian" Problem of Migratory Children's Education</h4>
            <p>In the perspective of "capital game," educational resources are often seen as a quantifiable investment, and the enrollment rate has become the main indicator to measure the "return rate" of education. This "enrollment rate supremacy" education concept has a profound impact on migratory children:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inequitable Distribution of Educational Resources</strong>: Due to the concentration of migratory children in urban-rural fringes or urban villages, educational resources in these areas are relatively scarce. Schools often focus limited resources on a few "elite students" to pursue enrollment rates, ignoring the educational needs of most migratory children.</li>
                <li><strong>Single Educational Evaluation System</strong>: The current educational evaluation system is mainly oriented by exam scores. Due to family background, cultural differences, and other factors, migratory children often lag behind in standardized exams. This single evaluation system not only exacerbates migratory children's sense of inferiority but also limits their personalized development.</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring Personalized Development</strong>: Migratory children face diverse challenges in their growth, such as adapting to urban culture, worrying about family economic conditions, and feeling confused about future development. However, existing education models often overlook these personalized needs, resulting in migratory children lacking a sense of belonging and identity during the education process.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>II. Diverse Educational Needs of Migratory Children</h4>
            <p>The educational needs of migratory children are not limited to knowledge transmission, but also include adapting to urban culture, worrying about family economic conditions, and feeling confused about future development.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adapting to Urban Culture</strong>: Growing up in urban-rural fringes, migratory children face the dual impact of urban and rural cultures. Schools and society should provide more cultural integration opportunities to help them better integrate into urban life.</li>
                <li><strong>Worries about Family Economic Conditions</strong>: The families of migratory children often have poor economic conditions, and parents are busy making a living, unable to provide sufficient educational support at home. Schools and society should pay attention to these families' economic conditions, providing more economic assistance and psychological support.</li>
                <li><strong>Confusion about Future Development</strong>: Due to a lack of stable social relationship networks and clear life plans, migratory children often feel confused about the future. Schools and society should provide more career planning and psychological counseling to help them establish correct life goals.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>III. Building an Educational System Centered on "Humanistic Care"</h4>
            <p>To break out of the circle of "enrollment rate supremacy," we need to build an educational system centered on "humanistic care," focusing on the physical and mental health development of migratory children.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Reforming the Educational Evaluation System</strong>: Establishing a diversified educational evaluation system, not only focusing on students' exam scores but also on their comprehensive qualities and social adaptability. Through diversified evaluation methods, discovering and cultivating the specialties and potential of migratory children.</li>
                <li><strong>Encouraging Schools to Carry Out Diverse Quality Education</strong>: Schools should carry out rich extracurricular activities such as sports, arts, and technology to help migratory children develop comprehensively. At the same time, schools should provide psychological counseling and support services to help them solve the confusion and problems in their growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening Support from the Government and Society</strong>: The government should increase investment in the education of migratory children, providing more high-quality educational resources. The society should also actively participate, providing more support and help for migratory children through public welfare activities and volunteer services.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Summary and Outlook: From Guests to Co-Builders of a Common Home</h3>
            <p>In summary, the migratory population in community governance is gradually transforming from passive "guests" to actively participating "co-builders of a common home." Although they face many difficulties in identity recognition, information access channels, and participation channels, through innovative community governance models, establishing platforms for the migratory population to participate, and ensuring their right to know, participate, and supervise, the digital inclusion and community co-construction of the migratory population will usher in a brighter future.</p>
