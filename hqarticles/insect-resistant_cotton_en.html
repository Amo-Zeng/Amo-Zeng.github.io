            <h2>Bt Cotton and GM Technology: Shaping the Future of Agriculture and Supply Chains</h2>
            <p>In the wave of globalization, the agricultural and textile industries are undergoing unprecedented transformations. As a landmark application of GM technology, Bt Cotton has not only disrupted traditional agroecosystems but also profoundly influenced global cotton supply chains, subtly altering consumer choices. This article will delve into how Bt Cotton and GM technology are driving the sustainable development of future agriculture and industries from three dimensions: agroecosystem, gene patents, and supply chains.</p>

            <h3>I. From Confrontation to Symbiosis: GM Technology Reshaping the Agroecosystem</h3>
            <h4>1.1 The Confrontational Nature of Traditional Agriculture</h4>
            <p>Traditional agricultural production models are built on a confrontational mindset dominated by humans. In pursuit of high yields, farmers often opt for single, high-yielding crop varieties, neglecting the importance of biodiversity. Meanwhile, the overuse of pesticides and fertilizers, while boosting yields in the short term, has led to soil degradation, water pollution, and a decline in ecosystem stability.</p>
            <h4>1.2 GM Technology Empowering Symbiotic Agroecosystems</h4>
            <p>The advent of GM technology offers new possibilities for restructuring agroecosystems. Through genetic engineering, scientists can cultivate crop varieties resistant to diseases and pests, significantly reducing the use of chemical pesticides. For instance, the widespread application of Bt Cotton has dramatically lowered pesticide spraying, protecting natural predators of pests and promoting natural ecosystem balance.</p>
            <h4>1.3 Future Prospects of Symbiotic Agriculture</h4>
            <p>Future agricultural development will be characterized by symbiosis, emphasizing biodiversity protection and overall ecosystem coordination. The integration of GM technology with traditional agricultural wisdom will provide crucial solutions for the synergistic development of agricultural production and the ecological environment, driving agriculture toward a more sustainable direction.</p>

            <h3>II. Ethical Dilemmas of Gene Patents: Interests, Justice, and Fairness</h3>
            <h4>2.1 The Birth and Monopolization of Gene Patents</h4>
            <p>The emergence of gene patents is both a product of technological progress and the result of interest博弈. When scientists successfully isolate a gene and apply for a patent, they gain exclusive rights to that gene. This monopolistic behavior has sparked widespread controversy.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Ethical Challenges of Gene Patents</h4>
            <p>Another major controversy surrounding gene patents lies in their ethical implications. As a shared heritage of humanity, is privatizing genes an infringement on human dignity? This "gene exploitation" not only poses obstacles to scientific research but also challenges social equity and justice.</p>
            <h4>2.3 Building a Fair Scientific Ethics System</h4>
            <p>Faced with the issues brought by gene patents, we need to re-examine the direction of technological development and build a more fair and just scientific ethics system. By constructing a fair scientific ethics system, we can ensure that technological advancements truly benefit society.</p>

            <h3>III. From Surviving to Thriving: Bt Cotton Reshaping Global Cotton Supply Chains and Consumer Choices</h3>
            <h4>3.1 The Birth and Value Reconstruction of Bt Cotton</h4>
            <p>The birth of Bt Cotton marks a significant transformation in the cotton industry. Through genetic engineering, scientists introduced insect-resistant genes into cotton plants, enabling them to directly resist major pests like the bollworm, thereby significantly reducing pesticide use.</p>
            <h4>3.2 Bt Cotton Reshaping Global Cotton Supply Chains</h4>
            <p>The promotion and application of Bt Cotton have had a profound impact on global cotton supply chains, driving a green transformation in cotton farming.</p>
