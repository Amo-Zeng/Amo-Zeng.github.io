            <h2>Innovation and Ethics in Experimental Methods: Exploring New Paths in Scientific Research</h2>
            <p>At the forefront of contemporary scientific research, the innovation of experimental methods and ethical reflection have become crucial drivers of scientific progress. While traditional experimental methods excel in data collection and analysis, they often fall short in addressing complex issues and ethical challenges. This article integrates the core perspectives and cases of narrative, interdisciplinary integration, and ethical reflection in experimental methods, analyzes their combined advantages and potential challenges, and explores their comprehensive impact on scientific research and social development.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Narrative in Experimental Methods: The Power of Scientific Stories</h3>
            <p>Narrative experimental methods enhance the appeal and engagement of experiments by combining the experimental process with storytelling elements, thereby strengthening the persuasiveness and dissemination effectiveness of experimental results.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Case: Memory Maze</strong> - In a psychology experiment on memory, researchers designed a virtual reality experiment called "Memory Maze." Participants played the role of detectives, needing to find clues in a virtual maze to solve a mysterious case. Each clue was related to a specific aspect of memory, such as remembering the location, color, and shape of certain items. This way, participants not only experienced the thrill of being a detective but also deepened their understanding of memory mechanisms through gamification.</li>
                <li><strong>New Case: Storytelling Climate Change</strong> - In the field of climate science, narrative experimental methods are equally significant. For example, researchers can use virtual reality technology to present the impacts of climate change in the form of stories to participants. Participants can "experience" extreme weather events caused by climate change, such as floods, droughts, and hurricanes, gaining a more intuitive understanding of the severity and urgency of climate change. This narrative experimental method not only increases public awareness of climate change issues but also enhances the effectiveness of scientific communication.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Interdisciplinary Integration in Experimental Methods: New Approaches to Solving Complex Problems</h3>
            <p>Interdisciplinary integration in experimental methods provides new ideas and tools for solving complex problems by combining knowledge and technologies from different disciplines.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Case: Cancer Prediction Model</strong> - In a study on cancer prediction, researchers used machine learning algorithms to analyze a large amount of gene expression data. By training the model, researchers could identify key genes related to cancer development and predict disease progression. This interdisciplinary experimental method not only improved the accuracy of cancer prediction but also provided new ideas for personalized treatment.</li>
                <li><strong>New Case: Integration of Environmental Science and Data Science</strong> - In the field of environmental science, interdisciplinary integration is also significant. For example, researchers can use big data analysis technology, combined with environmental monitoring data, to predict the spread trends and impact ranges of environmental pollution. Through this interdisciplinary experimental method, researchers can more effectively formulate environmental protection strategies, reducing the impact of environmental pollution on human health and ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ethical Reflection in Experimental Methods: Ensuring the Moral Boundaries of Scientific Research</h3>
            <p>The application of ethical reflection in experimental methods helps to regulate the experimental process, ensure the moral boundaries of scientific research, and avoid ethical risks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Case: Ethical Review of Facial Recognition Technology</strong> - In a study on facial recognition technology, researchers conducted ethical reflection and implemented strict privacy protection measures. During the experiment, all participants' facial data were anonymized and stored and transmitted using encryption technology. Additionally, researchers invited ethical experts to review the experimental plan to ensure it complied with ethical standards. This ethical reflection not only protected participants' privacy but also increased the credibility of the experimental results.</li>
                <li><strong>New Case: Ethical Review of Gene Editing Technology</strong> - In the field of gene editing, ethical reflection is equally crucial. For example, researchers can ensure that gene editing experiments comply with international ethical guidelines and avoid potential ethical risks through ethical review. Researchers can invite ethical experts to review the experimental plan to ensure informed consent and privacy protection of the experimental subjects. Through this ethical reflection, researchers can enhance public trust in gene editing technology and promote its healthy development.</li>
