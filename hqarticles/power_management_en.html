            <h2>From Micro to Macro: Building Smart, Collaborative, and Sustainable Power Management Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>With the rapid development of technology and continuous progress of human society, the demand for electricity is growing exponentially. From smartphones to data centers, from renewable energy to electric vehicles, power management has spanned multiple scales from microscopic particles to macroscopic ecosystems, becoming a highly complex systemic challenge. Traditional power management models, long in a "reactive response" state, rely on manual experience for energy consumption statistics and device status monitoring, making it difficult to cope with increasingly complex energy needs and dynamic changes. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a revolutionary transformation from "reactive response" to "proactive prediction," and from "single device" to "Internet of Everything." This article will explore how to build a smart, collaborative, and sustainable power management ecosystem from the perspectives of cross-scale thinking, AI empowerment, and IoT collaboration, to address future energy management challenges.</p>
