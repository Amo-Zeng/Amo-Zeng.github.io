            <h3>I. Ecological Agriculture: The Core Driving Force of Sustainable Agriculture</h3>
            <p>Ecological agriculture is not a simple return to traditional agriculture, but rather a new agricultural model deeply integrated with ecological principles under the support of modern science and technology. It emphasizes the cyclic use of resources, environmental protection, and the良性 cycle of ecosystems to build a production system that is "resource-saving, environmentally friendly, and product-safe." Its core goal is to achieve the organic integration of economic, social, and ecological benefits, thereby promoting sustainable agricultural development.</p>
            <p>The development trends of ecological agriculture indicate that it can not only effectively solve problems such as resource waste, environmental pollution, and food safety in traditional agriculture but also enhance the market competitiveness of agricultural products by promoting the green upgrading of the agricultural industrial chain. However, the widespread adoption of ecological agriculture has always faced a core challenge: how to achieve large-scale development while maintaining the health of the ecosystem. The essence of this problem lies in the fact that the ecological agriculture model often relies on specific regional natural and socio-economic conditions, making it difficult to form a replicable and widely applicable general model. Therefore, how to overcome this dilemma is the key to the development of ecological agriculture.</p>
