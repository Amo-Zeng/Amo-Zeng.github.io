            <h3>Breakthroughs in Nonlinear Propagation Mechanisms and Acoustic Imaging</h3>
            <p>During propagation, ultrasound, especially in high-intensity or complex media, exhibits significant nonlinear phenomena. These phenomena not only affect the propagation path and energy distribution of ultrasound but also provide new possibilities for acoustic imaging and detection technologies. Through in-depth research on nonlinear acoustic equations and the nonlinear elastic properties of media, scientists have developed nonlinear acoustic imaging technology, significantly improving image resolution and contrast.</p>
            <p>In the medical field, nonlinear acoustic imaging technology provides more accurate tools for the early diagnosis of tumors and other lesions. For example, in the early diagnosis of breast cancer, nonlinear acoustic imaging technology can detect the nonlinear elastic properties of tumor tissues, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity. In industrial non-destructive testing, nonlinear ultrasound technology provides higher sensitivity for detecting microcracks and fatigue damage in materials. For instance, in the aerospace industry, nonlinear ultrasound technology is used to detect microcracks in aircraft engine turbine blades, ensuring flight safety.</p>

            <h3>Revolutionary Applications in Microfluidics and Nanotechnology</h3>
            <p>Ultrasound's applications in microfluidics and nanotechnology are leading a revolution, particularly in precisely controlling minute fluids and nanoscale structures. In microfluidic systems, ultrasound generates acoustic streaming and acoustic radiation forces, enabling precise manipulation of fluids at the micrometer and even nanometer scales, providing powerful technical support for applications such as cell sorting, drug delivery, and gene editing.</p>
            <p>In nanofabrication, ultrasound-assisted etching, deposition, and assembly technologies achieve precise material processing and assembly through high-frequency vibrations, offering new possibilities for manufacturing nanoelectronic devices and nanobiosensors. For example, in the production of nanowires or nanopores, ultrasound-assisted etching can achieve sub-nanometer precision in structure processing, providing new opportunities for developing high-performance electronic devices. In nanobiosensors, ultrasound-assisted deposition can be used to produce highly sensitive nanoelectrodes or nanoprobes, enhancing the detection performance of sensors.</p>

            <h3>Integration of Ultrasound with Quantum Technology</h3>
            <p>With the rapid development of quantum technology, ultrasound is expected to play a key role in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. In quantum computing, ultrasound can serve as an efficient method for quantum bit manipulation, regulating quantum states through phonon-electron interactions to achieve more precise quantum gate operations. For example, in superconducting quantum computing, ultrasound excites local strains in materials, affecting the energy level structure of quantum bits and enabling the transfer and maintenance of quantum states.</p>
            <p>In quantum communication, ultrasound can be used for the transmission and conversion of quantum states, achieving efficient quantum state transfer between different quantum systems through acoustic wave interference and diffraction effects. For instance, in photonic quantum communication, ultrasound can utilize acoustic wave interference to convert photon states into phonon states, efficiently transmitting them in acoustic media, thereby improving the transmission efficiency of quantum states and suppressing environmental noise.</p>
            <p>In quantum sensing, ultrasound exhibits unique advantages in high-sensitivity phonon detection and environmental noise suppression. For example, in underground resource exploration, ultrasound sensors can use quantum superposition and entanglement to detect weak acoustic signals with high sensitivity, enhancing the precision and efficiency of resource exploration. In biomolecular detection, ultrasound sensors can utilize quantum entanglement and superconducting devices to detect biomolecular vibration signals with high sensitivity, providing new technical means for biomolecular detection and medical diagnosis.</p>
