**Translation:**  

The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) brings technological innovation alongside profound challenges to data privacy. The following is a systematic analysis of current issues and a discussion of solutions:

### **Core Privacy Risks Posed by AI**  
1. **Data Collection and Abuse**  
   - **Massive Data Dependency**: AI models (e.g., facial recognition, recommendation algorithms) require vast amounts of data for training, often involving sensitive information such as personal behavior patterns and biometric features.  
   - **Covert Data Acquisition**: Users’ location data, browsing history, and voice interactions may be continuously recorded without their explicit awareness—for example, smart home devices might collect ambient sounds in the background.  
   - **Secondary Data Use**: Data collected for one purpose is repurposed without user consent, such as shifting from advertising targeting to insurance risk assessment.  

2. **Technical Vulnerabilities and Re-Identification**  
   - Even anonymized data can be re-identified through machine learning cross-dataset analysis (e.g., combining social media activity with personal spending habits).

### **Cutting-Edge Privacy Technologies**  
1. **Differential Privacy**  
   - **Principle**: Random noise is added to training data or model outputs, ensuring that the inclusion or exclusion of a single data point does not significantly affect results.  
   - **Example**: Apple’s iOS uses this technique to collect typing habits without tracing individual users.  
   - **Limitation**: May reduce model accuracy, requiring a balance between privacy and utility.  

2. **Federated Learning**  
   - **Architecture**: Data is trained locally on user devices, with only encrypted gradient updates shared (not raw data), as seen in Google’s Gboard keyboard predictions.  
   - **Advantages**: Reduces centralized data breach risks, particularly useful in sensitive fields like healthcare.  
   - **Challenges**: High communication costs and managing model consistency across heterogeneous devices.  

3. **Encryption and Access Control**  
   - **Homomorphic Encryption**: Allows computations on encrypted data, with results remaining valid after decryption (e.g., genomic data analysis).  
   - **Least Privilege Principle**: Dynamic access controls limit users or algorithms to only essential data (e.g., a bank’s risk management system accessing only loan-related fields).

### **Policy and Legal Frameworks**  
1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**  
   - Requires "double opt-in" consent before data collection.  
   - Grants users the "right to be forgotten," compelling companies to delete personal data (e.g.,彻底清除历史记录 after deleting a social media account).  
   - Penalties for violations can reach 4% of global revenue (e.g., Amazon fined €746 million in 2021 for GDPR breaches).  

2. **China’s Personal Information Protection Law**  
   - Enforces the "minimum necessity principle," prohibiting excessive data collection (e.g., health code apps cannot access users’ contact lists).  
   - Mandates that automated decisions provide non-personalized options (e.g., e-commerce recommendation buttons must include an option to disable personalization).

### **Multi-Dimensional Collaborative Governance**  
1. **Corporate Responsibility**  
   - Implement Privacy by Design principles, such as Microsoft Azure embedding default data encryption in cloud services.  
   - Conduct Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) early in AI development to identify risks, such as evaluating the necessity of storing facial recognition data for autonomous vehicles.  

2. **Tech-Law Synergy**  
   - GDPR Article 25 requires "data protection by default," pushing companies to adopt technologies like differential privacy.  
   - Open-source compliance toolkits (e.g., Google’s Differential Privacy library) lower technical barriers for small businesses.  

3. **Public Education and Engagement**  
   - Use "informed-control" models to enhance user agency, such as Firefox’s built-in privacy scoring to guide choices toward low-data-tracking services.  
   - Establish data trust frameworks, allowing third-party institutions to monitor corporate data use on behalf of users (tested in the UK’s open banking model).

### **Future Challenges and Outlook**  
- **Ethical AI Surveillance**: Law enforcement’s use of real-time facial recognition requires clear boundaries between public safety and individual privacy.  
- **Cross-Border Data Flow**: Data management for overseas servers (e.g., TikTok) raises conflicts between national sovereignty and user rights, necessitating international agreements.  
- **Quantum Computing Threats**: Existing encryption algorithms may become obsolete, driving the development of post-quantum cryptography (e.g., the U.S. NIST has initiated standardization efforts).  

**Conclusion**: Privacy protection requires a "technology-law-society" triad. Only through transparent algorithms, strict legislation, and public empowerment can AI innovation and data rights coexist. Companies must move beyond passive compliance, embedding privacy into product design to build long-term trust.
